Six chronic diseases were considered: obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We calibrated the database using a bias quantification method to consider undiagnosed disease cases. To estimate the total impact of multiple diseases, we defined a multimorbidity variable according to the number of diseases. Risks of hospitalization and death were estimated with Poisson regression models and used to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs). Chronic diseases accounted for to 25.4% [95% CI: 24.8%C26.1%], 28.3% (95% CI: 27.8%C28.7%) and 15.3% (95% CI: 14.9%C15.7%) of the hospitalizations among adults below 40, 40C59, and 60 years and older, respectively.

In this paper, we present feasible solutions for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. Two structurally-different deep learning techniques, SegNet and U-NET, are investigated for semantically segmenting infected tissue regions in CT lung images. METHODS: We propose to use two known deep learning networks, SegNet and U-NET, for image tissue classification. SegNet is characterized as a scene segmentation network and U-NET as a medical segmentation tool. Both networks were exploited as binary segmentors to discriminate between infected and healthy lung tissue, also as multi-class segmentors to learn the infection type on the lung. Each network is trained using seventy-two data images, validated on ten images, and tested against the left eighteen images. Several statistical scores are calculated for the results and tabulated accordingly. RESULTS: The results show the superior ability of SegNet in classifying infected/non-infected tissues compared to the other methods (with 0.95 mean accuracy), while the U-NET shows better results as a multi-class segmentor (with 0.91 mean accuracy). CONCLUSION: Semantically segmenting CT scan images of COVID-19 patients is a crucial goal because it would not only assist in disease diagnosis, also help in quantifying the severity of the illness, and hence, prioritize the population treatment accordingly. We propose computer-based techniques that prove to be reliable as detectors for infected tissue in lung CT scans. The availability of such a method in todays pandemic would help automate, prioritize, fasten, and broaden the treatment of COVID-19 patients globally.","output":"COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation using deep learning methods: U-Net versus SegNet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic in late 2019 and early 2020 presented new and urgent challenges to mental health services and legislators around the world.

METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

They fully reopened in September. During the summer, infections started to increase in the general population, speeding up in September. Some measures were taken to limit social contacts but those were insufficient to mitigate the exponential rise of infections in October. Children were still receiving all lessons at school at that time and it was questioned whether this position was tenable. We systematically compared the benefits and harms of closing primary and secondary schools and developed a recommendation. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel, including school pupils and teachers, educational experts, clinicians and researchers, produced this recommendation in compliance with the standards for trustworthy rapid guidelines. The recommendation is based on data collected through national surveillance or studies from Belgium, and supported by a rapid literature review. RESULTS: Closing schools during the first lockdown probably resulted in a large learning delay and possibly led to more cases of child abuse. We are uncertain about the effect on the infection rate, hospitalisations, transmission rates, mental health of children, teachers and parents. The panel concluded that the balance of benefits and harms of closing schools clearly shifts against closing schools. Detrimental effects are even worse for vulnerable children. This recommendation is affected by the local virus circulation. CONCLUSION: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against closing schools when the virus circulation is low to moderate, and a weak recommendation against closing schools when the virus circulation is high. It does not apply when the school system cannot function due to lack of teachers, too many children who are at home or a shortage of support services. As the results of international studies are consistent with Belgian study results, this recommendation may also be relevant internationally.","output":"Closing schools for SARS-CoV-2: a pragmatic rapid recommendation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This case report describes a large sporadic benign phaeochromocytoma with classic symptoms and an unexpected SARS-CoV-2 virus contagious during the first pandemic wave. Clinical Case: A 61-years-old healthy man was admitted in the hospital emergency with hypertension, facial flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting and tremors. The patient presented hypertensive encephalopathy requiring orotracheal intubation. During the procedure, after rocuronium administration, the arterial pressure levels suddenly incresead more. An abdomen CT performed for vomiting investigation showed a mass in the left upper quadrant measuring 12.3 x 8.1 x 11.4 cm, central cystic area and sparse coarse calcifications, solid component density of 30 UH in the non-contrast phase and absolut washout of 48%, suggesting phaeochromocytoma (FEO) etiology. The patient renal function impaired and hemodialysis was required as replacement therapy. Even with small amount of urine available for exams, 24h urine tests were compatible with FEO diagnosis: (normetanephrines above 4260 mcg/L, n&amp;lt;732 mcg/L, 250 mL of urine). Considering the severity of symptoms, a chest CT scan was provided, not demonstrating any metastatic disease. Parenteral antihypertensive medication to manage blood pressure was required and this withdraw was reached after the introduction of prazosin 2 mg twice a day. After adequate preoperative preparation, the surgical removal was performed. Systolic BP intraoperative fluctuations occurred, with variations between 70 and 210mmHg. Splenectomy was necessary due the intimate contact with the adrenal mass. No obvious metastases were observed. The anatomopathological showed a 390 grams adrenal mass confirming FEO (PASS score 5). Genetic panel for phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma with complete sequencing found no pathogenic variants in any of the 22 genes analyzed, suggesting sporadic etiology.

On the other hand it is a curable illness through the surgical tumor removal. Attention should be paid to high blood pressure levels even after the tumor is removed which can be justified by the remaining vascular hypertrophy as long as the suspicion of malignant FEO is excluded.","output":"Incidental Giant Cystic Phaeochromocytoma: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is making great strides in promoting patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research across Europe, supporting patient organisations to be involved in the projects that it funds. Despite this, the literature around PPI in health services and research originating from European countries appears less than from the United Kingdom (UK), where PPI is well established. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to explore the attitudes and approaches to PPI across Europe. Eight scientific databases were systematically searched and data extracted. Data quality was assessed using a checklist based on the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) (Staniszewska et al., Research, Involvement and Engagement, 3, 13, 2017) and the critical appraisal guidelines developed by Wright et al.

Forty studies in total were included in the analysis. The studies imply a growing interest and support for the idea of PPI in health services and, to a lesser extent, in health research. There seems to be a convergence of conceptualisations of PPI across Europe, with internationally significant areas of innovative work taking place in countries such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. However, the implementation of PPI is highly uneven, and PPI is not yet firmly embedded or adequately formalised in European healthcare systems and research, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure, guidance and support.

Based on treatment errors made by students participating the endodontic courses at RWTH Aachen University (Germany), new radiopaque artificial root canal treatment models (DRSK RCT; incisor, premolar, molar) were designed and developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate these models by groups of students and demonstrators. METHODS: A total number of 60 students and seven demonstrators from a single institution (RWTH Aachen) participated in this study. They performed endodontic treatments on either initial versions of the DRSK RCT or modified versions. The initial versions were evaluated by students (n = 25) and demonstrators (n = 7). The obtained questionnaire was conducted as 7-point Likert-Scale covering the topics material properties, feeling while performing exercises and perception of its closeness to reality via 19 items (students) and 21 items (demonstrators). According to the evaluations several alterations were applied to the DRSK RCT, the whole study was repeated and evaluated by different students (n = 35) and the same demonstrators (n = 7). Additionally, the demonstrators blindly evaluated the quality of root canal treatments performed by the students (n = 35) on the modified DRSK RCT. Comparisons between the initial versions and the modified versions were calculated using Chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Students as well as demonstrators positively evaluated both variants of the DRSK RCT with especially high ratings in the overall evaluation. Students rating of the pulp anatomy significantly increased from 5.4  1.1 (mean  SD) to 5.9  0.9 (mean  SD; p < 0.05) for the modified model. Likewise, students felt that the ability to flare root canals improved after alterations have been applied. Ratings significantly increased from 4.8  1.6 (mean  SD) to 5.6  1.0 (mean  SD; p < 0.05).

The recent availability of treatment for ATTR-CM has stimulated increased awareness of the disease and patient identification. Stratification of patients with ATTR-CM is critical for optimal management and treatment; however, monitoring disease progression is challenging and currently lacks best-practice guidance. In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.","output":"Expert consensus on the monitoring of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed our way of living. To minimize life losses, multi-level strategies requiring collective efforts were adopted while waiting for the vaccines' rollout. The management of such complex processes has taken benefit from the rising framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), and particularly the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) since it is probably the most suitable approach to both the micro (user) and the macro (processes) scale. Hence, a single infrastructure can support both the logistic and monitoring issues related to the war against a pandemic. Based on the COVID-19 experience, this paper is a survey on how state-of-the-art RFID systems can be employed in facing future pandemic outbreaks. The three pillars of the contrast of the pandemic are addressed: 1) use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 2) access control and social distancing, and 3) early detection of symptoms. For each class, the envisaged RFID devices and procedures are discussed based on the available technology and the current worldwide research. This survey that RFID could generate an extraordinary amount of data so that complementary paradigms of Edge Computing and Artificial intelligence can be tightly integrated to extract profiles and identify anomalous events in compliance with privacy and security.","output":"A Survey on Radio Frequency Identification as a Scalable Technology to Face Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study has been conducted for the purpose of determining serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia before and after treatment and the clinical significance of hepcidin in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the Training, Research and Application Center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with suspected neonatal septicemia. 8.5 mL of blood was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes before and after treatment for one-off biochemical analyses and centrifuged. After this, the serum was separated. Hepcidin, TAS, TOS, and Fe levels in the serum were measured. RESULTS: While pre-treatment hepcidin levels were 58.423.46 ng/mL, post-treatment levels were 46.872.98 ng/mL (p<0.05). Pre-treatment Fe levels were 60.137.27 g/dl, while post-treatment levels were 83.18.09 g/dl (p<0.05). The changes in the TAS and TOS levels were also found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In light of the fact that hepcidin plays a role function in the regulation of Fe as well as the fact that Fe is a significant nutritional source for many microorganisms, it was concluded that hepcidin may play a significant role in nutritional immunity and the pathogenesis of diseases.","output":"Relationship between hepcidin and oxidant/antioxidant status in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, an emerging infectious viral disease implicating a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Elderly people, being more fragile, are the most affected by the severity and lethality of this disease. The NH and LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital registered their first Covid-19 cases in February 2020, which lead to the opening of a Covid-19 dedicated unit and of specific protocol for confinement. This descriptive study was analyzing the prevalence of Covid-19 seroconversion within the NH and the LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital. Both this screening test and the nasopharyngeal swab PCRs were in order to assess the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in NH and LTCU. On June 15th and 16th, the serological tests for Covid-19 were positive for 146 (66.1%) of the residents tested. The seroconversion rate was significantly different (p < 0.001) between the NH (88.7%) and the LTCU (45.6%). During the epidemic, there was no excess mortality index within the NH and LTCU services of the Amiens University Hospital. Among frail patients, the role of immunosenescence can be discussed to account for the absence of this inflammatory reaction. This study showed that isolating the infected patient in a dedicated unit significantly reduces the risk of seroconversion and contamination compared to isolating them within their own unit.","output":"[Covid-19 serology in nursing home and long-term care: prevalence of seroconversion in the Amiens-Picardie University Hospital]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected the assisted reproductive technology (ART) practice. Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect endometrial tissues during ART is crucial for risk mitigation. Materials and Methods: To address this question, we retrospectively examined the gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases in endometrial biopsies of a cohort of ART candidates using Affymetrix microarray data. Human endometrial tissue under natural (n=62) and COS cycles (n=42) were analyzed. A focus was particularly made on the renin-angiotensin system relates genes with a prominent role in the virus infection, and gene expression levels of receptors and proteases closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infectionwas also studied. Results: Using our large cohort of endometrial samples, we reported a high prevalence of genes related to the ACE2 pathway, including AGT, AGTR1, ANPEP, CTSA, ENPEP, LNPEP, MME, NLN, THOP1, BSG and CTSL during both phases(early- and mid-secretory phase), and mainly during the mid-secretory phase for ACE2. The highest signal intensities were found for CTSA, LNPEP, MME, NLN, BSG and CTSL. The most representative of dual coexpression of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptor and protease in endometrium was BSG-CSTL and BSG-CTSA. It s also important to note high variation of SARS-CoV-2 receptors inter-patients under natural cycle.Globally, the impact of COS on endometrial gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases of non Covid-19 patients is low, suggesting no additional potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection during stimulated ART procedure compared with natural cycles. Conclusions: Analyses of gene expression profiles ofSARS-CoV-2 host entry candidates from microarray data suggest that endometrium should be considered as potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: 2 surveys were sent to nurses working in the rheumatology area (Both in the Outpatient department and day care unit) during October 2020 in Spain. The first survey had 10 questions about what happened in the rheumatology units in the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic (March to June of 2020) and the second survey had 10 questions about the standards of quality of nursing care in times of pandemic. Google forms were used to collect and analyze data. Results: 32 nurses completed the survey (30 women (93.8%)) with an average age of 49.6  10.2 years. 93.8% work in the outpatient clinics and 2(6.2%) in day care units. The main results of the effects of the first wave of the pandemic are as follow: 4(12.5%) nurses were transferred to other areas of the hospital, 27(84.4%) showed changes in their care activity;and in 12(37,5%) of the surveyed centers, (slightly less than half of the medical staff) left their usual activity to care for COVID-19 patients. In June 2020, at the end of the first wave, 17(53.1%) reported more decompensated patients and 22(68.8%) reported that they had both telephone and face-to-face consultations;15(46.9%) reported that their clinical activity had increased. Regarding the standards of quality during the pandemia: 27(84.4%) believed that rheumatology units should be strengthened,31(96.9%) reported the need to carry out COVID educational campaigns in rheumatic patients and 30(100%) stated that nursing education should lead that education;31(96.7%) believed that telephone consultation should be on demand and by telephone, 25 (78.1%) considered it necessary to include video calls and the possibility of receiving reports in non-face to face care and photos. Finally, 23(71.9%) centers recorded nursing and medical telephone consultations in their medical records. Conclusion: The pandemic had a huge impact on nursing care for rheumatic patients, with difficulties associated with extra work load and changes in the dynamics of care.

Anatomical but also systemic and local metabolic alterations are proposed contributors to the pathophysiology of lung diseases in the context of obesity. To bring perspective to this discussion, we used NMR to compare the obesity-associated metabolomic profiles of the lung with those of the liver, heart, skeletal muscles, kidneys, brain and serum from male C57Bl/6J mice fed with a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHSD) diet vs. standard (SD) chow for 14 weeks. Our results showed that the lung was the second most affected organ after the liver, and that the two organs shared reduced one-carbon (1C) metabolism and increased lipid accumulation. Altered 1C metabolism was found in all organs and in the serum, but serine levels were increased only in the lung of HFHSD compared to SD. Lastly, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-derived metabolites were specifically and oppositely regulated in the serum and kidneys but not in other organs. Collectively, our data highlighted that HFHSD induced specific metabolic changes in all organs, the lung being the second most affected organ, the main alterations affecting metabolite concentrations of the 1C pathway and, to a minor extend, TCA.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends monitoring of anti-malarial drug resistance every 2 years. The study aimed to provide baseline data for biennial molecular surveillance of anti-malarial drug resistance by comparing data from a study conducted in 2019 to previously published data from a similar study conducted in 2017 in the DRC. METHODS: From July to November 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted in ten sites which were previously selected for a similar study conducted in 2017 across the DRC. P. falciparum malaria was diagnosed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or by microscopy and dried blood samples (DBS) were taken from patients who had a positive test. Segments of interest in pfcrt and pfk13 genes were amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing. RESULTS: Out of 1087 enrolled patients, 906 (83.3%) were PCR-confirmed for P. falciparum. Like in the 2017-study, none of the mutations known to be associated with Artemisinine (ART) resistance in Southeast Asia was detected. However, non-synonymous (NS) mutations with unknown functions were observed among which, A578S was detected in both 2017 and 2019-studies. The overall prevalence of pfcrt-K76T mutation that confers CQ-resistance was 22.7% in 2019-study compared to 28.5% in 2017-study (p-value = 0.069), but there was high variability between sites in the two studies. Like in 2017-study, the pfcrt 72C76 SVMNT haplotype associated with resistance to amodiaquine was not detected. CONCLUSION: The study reported, within 2 years, the non-presence of molecular markers currently known to be associated with resistance to ART and to AQ in P. falciparum isolated in the DRC. However, the presence of polymorphisms with as-yet unknown functions was observed, requiring further characterization. Moreover, an overall decrease in the prevalence of CQ-resistance marker was observed in the DRC, but this prevalence remained highly variable from region to region.

It is generally assumed that there is a direct relationship between antibody accessibility to antigens and accessible surface of proteins. Based on this assumption, prediction systems often includes solvent accessibility values calculated from the primary sequence of proteins or from their three dimensional structures as a predictive criterion. However, the current prediction systems seem weakly efficient in view of benchmark tests. We were interested in evaluating how amino acids that have been experimentally identified as epitopic elements could differ from the rest of the antigenic molecule at the level of surface exposure, hence we assessed the average accessibility of epitopes. The approach used here utilises published epitopes deduced from numerous identification techniques, including sequence scanning and structure visualisation after crystallography, and it involves many types of antigens from toxins to allergens. Our results show that epitopic residues are not distributed among any specific Relative Surface Accessibility and Protrusion Index values and that, in some cases, epitopes cover the entire antigenic sequence. These results led to the conclusion that the classification of known epitopes with respect to the experimental conditions used to identify them should be introduced before attempting to characterise epitopic areas in a generic way.","output":"A generic approach to evaluate how B-cell epitopes are surface-exposed on protein structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coronavirus infection ranges from asymptomatic through to fatal COVID\\\\19 characterised by a cytokine storm and lung failure.

OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID\\\\19 METHODS: Narrative review RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID\\\\19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P=0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID\\\\19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID\\\\19 severity but it is all indirect. Community\\\\based placebo\\\\controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID\\\\19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels.

The TMPRSS2 gene encodes a Transmembrane Protease Serine-2 protein (TMPS2) that belongs to the serine protease family. There is no crystal structure available for TMPS2, therefore, a homology model was required to establish a putative 3D structure for the enzyme. A homology model was constructed using SWISS-MODEL and evaluations were performed through Ramachandran plots, Verify 3D and Protein Statistical Analysis (ProSA). Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the stability of the constructed model.

Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. AIMS: With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. METHODS: A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. OUTCOMES: Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). RESULTS: Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (?males = -0.18 and ?females = -0.14), relational health (?males = 0.26 and ?females = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (?males = 0.43 and ?females = 0.31), and indirectly (?males = 0.13 and ?females = 0.13). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited.

Here we report clinical characteristics and outcomes following COVID-19 infection among children with underlying malignancy or a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) during the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in Dallas, TX. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed children with a history of malignancy or prior HSCT and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result between March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were reviewed, and analyzed according to underlying condition and disease severity. Results: Forty-six patients with underlying malignancy or HSCT met inclusion criteria. Median age was 9 years, with twenty (43%) female, and twenty-seven (59%) of Hispanic ethnicity. Underlying conditions included Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (67%), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (9%), HSCT (11%), sarcoma (9%), solid tumors (9%), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (2%). Fifteen subjects (33%) were asymptomatic, with twenty-four children (52%) classified as having mild, five (11%) with severe, and two (4%) with critical COVID-19 disease. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever (46%), cough (39%), and gastroenteritis (19%). Thirty-four children (74%) were hospitalized, with seven (15%) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care. 17% of patients were admitted for treatment of COVID-19 alone, with other indications including neutropenic fever, relapse, and chemotherapy. Six (13%) patients required non-invasive ventilation, and two patients (4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 4.5-24.5), with median ICU stay of 3.5 days (IQR 2-26.7). Seven children (15%) received COVID-19 targeted therapy including steroids, remdesivir or convalescent plasma. Among severe and critically ill children, six (86%) had underlying hematologic malignancies (5 HR ALL, 1 AML), and two (28%) a prior history of HSCT. Two children (4%) died. Thirty-six patients (78%) achieved documented clearance of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, at median of 43.5 days (IQR 28.7-65.2). Conclusion: Among children with underlying malignancy or a history of HSCT, COVID-19 results in a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic disease to death. Rates of hospitalization are high compared to the general pediatric population, and illness may be complicated by additional factors including co-infection, neutropenic fever, relapse of malignancy and need for chemotherapy. Children with hematologic malignancy or a history of HSCT may be at increased risk for severe disease.

Bear bile consumers (86% respondents) were wealthier, more likely to have family who consumed bile, and less knowledgeable about bile treatments than non-consumers. Consumer preferences were heterogenous but most consumers preferred switching between bile types as disease worsened. We identified five distinct latent classes within our sample: 'law-abiding consumers' (34% respondents), who prefer legal products and were unlikely to switch; two 'all-natural consumer' groups (53%), who dislike synthetics but may switch between farmed and wild products; and two 'non-consumer' groups (12%) who prefer not to buy bile. People with past experience of bile consumption had different preferences than those without. Willingness to switch to wild products was related to believing they were legal, although the likelihood of switching was mediated by preferences for cheaper products sold in legal, familiar places. We show that consumers of wild bile may switch, given the availability of a range of legal alternatives, while legal-product consumers may switch to illegal products if the barriers to doing so are small. Understanding preferences that promote or impede switching should be a key consideration when attempting to predict consumer behaviour in complex wildlife markets.

We experienced a major Sars-CoV-2 outbreak in our cardiac surgery unit, with several patients that tested positive early after surgery. Here we describe the characteristics, the post-operative course and laboratory findings of these patients, along with the fate of the health-care workers. We also discuss how we reorganize and reallocate hospital resources in order to resume the surgical activity without further positive patients. Methods After diagnosis of the first symptomatic patient, surgery was suspended. Nasopharyngeal swabs were carried out in all patients and health care workers. Sars-CoV-2 positive patients were isolated and monitored throughout the in-hospital stay and followed-up after discharged until death or clinical recovery. Results Twenty patients were found positive to Sars-CoV-2 sometimes after cardiac surgery (mean age 6910.4 y/o; median EuroSCORE-II 3(IQR 5.1)); median time from surgery to diagnosis was 15 days (IQR 11). Among them eighteen had received cardiac surgery and two of them transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Overall mortality was 15%. Specific COVID-19 related symptoms were identified in 7 patients (35%). Among the twelve health-care workers infected, one developed a bilateral mild-grade interstitial pneumonia. Conclusion COVID-19 infection after cardiac surgery, regardless the time of the onset, is a serious condition. The systemic inflammatory state that follows the extracorporeal circulation may mask the typical COVID-19 laboratory findings, making the diagnosis more problematic.

As one of the drugs for hyaluronan inhibition, hymecromone was chosen for evaluating its therapeutic effects on COVID-19. Methods ELISA was performed to detect the level of HA in COVID-19 patients. We first analyzed the correlation between the level of plasma HA and clinical parameters (lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and fibrinogen). We then assessed the correlation between the plasma HA level and pulmonary lesions, which were quantified by using artificial intelligence based on chest CT scans, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of hyaluronan treatment on the formation of pulmonary lesions in mice and evaluated the role of hymecromone on hyaluronan production in cultured cells. Finally, 94 of the 144 confirmed COVID-19 patients received oral hymecromone in addition to standard care, whereas the others with only standard care were treated as control. Abnormal serological markers in two groups were selected to determine the efficacy of hymecromone. Findings Plasma HA was closely relevant to clinical parameters, including lymphocytes (n = 158; r = -0.50; P<0.0001), CRP (n = 156; r = 0.55; P<0.0001), D-dimer (n = 154; r = 0.38; P<0.0001), and fibrinogen (n = 152; r = 0.37; P<0.0001), as well as the mass (n = 120; r = 0.30; P = 0.0008) and volume (n = 120; r = 0.30; P = 0.0009) of GGO, the mass (n = 120; r = 0.34; P = 0.0002) and volume (n = 120; r = 0.35; P<0.0001) of consolidation. Mice experiment further verified that hyaluronan could cause pulmonary lesions directly. Hymecromone remarkably reduced HA via downregulating HAS2/HAS3 expression. Accordingly, the number of lymphocytes recovered more quickly as the fold change of lymphocytes per day was higher in hymecromone-treated patients (n=8) than the control group (n=5) (P <0.01). Moreover, 89% patients with hymecromone treatment had pulmonary lesion absorption while only 42% patients in control group had pulmonary lesion absorption (P<0.0001). Interpretation Hyaluronan is closely correlated with COVID-19 progression and can serve as a plasma biomarker. As a promising treatment for COVID-19, hymecromone deserves our further efforts to determine its effect in a larger cohort of COVID-19 patients.

No widely applicable preoperative risk-assessment tool exists. We aimed to develop and validate a risk-assessment tool to predict VIH after abdominal surgery. STUDY DESIGN A prospective study of all patients undergoing abdominal surgery was conducted at a single institution from 2008 to 2010. Variables were defined in accordance with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, and VIH was determined through clinical and radiographic evaluation. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was built from a development cohort (2008 to 2009) to identify predictors of VIH. The HERNIAscore was created by converting the hazards ratios (HR) to points. The predictive accuracy was assessed on the validation cohort (2010) using a receiver operator characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Of 625 patients followed for a median of 41 months (range 0.3 to 64 months), 93 (13.9%) developed a VIH. The training cohort (n = 428, VIH = 70, 16.4%) identified 4 independent predictors: laparotomy (HR 4.77, 95% CI 2.61 to 8.70) or hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL, HR 4.00, 95% CI 2.08 to 7.70), COPD (HR 2.35; 95% CI 1.44 to 3.83), and BMI  25 kg/m(2) (HR1.74; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91). Factors that were not predictive included age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, albumin, immunosuppression, previous surgery, and suture material or technique. The predictive score had an AUC = 0.77 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.86) using the validation cohort (n = 197, VIH = 23, 11.6%). Using the HERNIAscore: HERNIAscore = 4(?)Laparotomy+3(?)HAL+1(?)COPD+1(?) BMI  25, 3 classes stratified the risk of VIH: class I (0 to 3 points),5.2%; class II (4 to 5 points),19.6%; and class III (6 points), 55.0%. CONCLUSIONS The HERNIAscore accurately identifies patients at increased risk for VIH. Although external validation is needed, this provides a starting point to counsel patients and guide clinical decisions. Increasing the use of laparoscopy, weight-loss programs, community smoking prevention programs, and incisional reinforcement may help reduce rates of VIH.","output":"Development and validation of a risk stratification score for ventral incisional hernia after abdominal surgery: hernia expectation rates in intra-abdominal surgery (the HERNIA Project)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new and efficient algorithm to solve the threshold all vs. all problem, which involves searching of two strings (with length N and M respectively) for finding all maximal approximate matches of length at least S and with up to K differences.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%-28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%-96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%-96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination.

Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of saliva versus swabs collected by healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients themselves to assess whether saliva detection can be offered as a cost-effective, risk-free method of SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: This study was conducted in a hospital involving outpatients and hospitalized patients. A total of 3018 outpatients were tested. Of these, 200 qRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited for further study. In addition, 101 SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalized patients with symptoms were also enrolled in the study. From outpatients, HCWs collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), saliva were obtained. From inpatients, HCWs collected swabs, patient-collected swabs, and saliva were obtained. qRT-PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by TAQPATH assay to determine the sensitivity of saliva detection. Sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of detecting SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using MedCalc. RESULTS: Of 3018 outpatients (asymptomatic: 2683, symptomatic: 335) tested by qRT-PCR, 200 were positive (males: 140, females: 60; aged 37.9  12.8 years; (81 asymptomatic, 119 symptomatic). Of these, saliva was positive in 128 (64%); 39 of 81 asymptomatic (47%),89 of 119 symptomatic patients (74.8%). Sensitivity of detection was 60.9% (55.4-66.3%, CI 95%), with a negative predictive value of 36%(32.9-39.2%, CI 95%).Among 101 hospitalized patients (males:65, females: 36; aged 53.48  15.6 years), with HCW collected NPS as comparator, sensitivity of saliva was 56.1% (47.5-64.5, CI 95%), specificity 63.5%(50.4-75.3, CI95%) with PPV of 77.2% and NPV of 39.6% and that of self-swab was 52.3%(44-60.5%, CI95%), specificity 56.6% (42.3-70.2%, CI95%) with PPV 77.2% and NPV29.7%. Comparison of positivity with the onset of symptoms revealed highest detection in saliva on day 3 after onset of symptoms. Additionally, only saliva was positive in 13 (12.8%) hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: Saliva which is easier to collect than nasopharyngeal swab is a viable alternate to detect SARS-COV-2 in symptomatic patients in the early stage of onset of symptoms. Although saliva is currently not recommended for screening asymptomatic patients, optimization of collection and uniform timing of sampling might improve the sensitivity enabling its use as a screening tool at community level.","output":"Comparison of saliva with healthcare workers- and patient-collected swabs in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a large cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the endoscope has the disadvantages of an unstable visual field and wide blind space. We developed a compact charge-coupled device (CCD) camera unit that can be transgastrointestinally placed in the abdominal cavity. METHODS The requisites for a wireless CCD camera unit for use in NOTES have been cited as: monitoring performance, fixation to the abdominal wall, attitude control, and antifogging functionality. Models to meet these requisites were prepared to assess their performance. The monitor had a CCD with dimensions of 7 x 7 x 7 mm and resolution of 410,000 pixels. The unit had a structure that allowed its attachment to the endoscope apex when placed to the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall fixation unit was equipped with a pantograph-type needle structure that was easily activated and retained by changing the polarity of an electromagnetic force. The pantograph-type needle head was designed to rotate by 360 degrees as an attitude-control mechanism, and both the pantograph and attitude-control mechanisms enabled attitude control in horizontal and vertical directions by a magnetic force applied from outside the body. Fogging was prevented by a vibration mechanism that physically cleaned the CCD lens surface and by titanium dioxide coating of the lens surface. RESULTS The CCD camera unit was confirmed to have sufficient performance as an auxiliary monitor for endoscopy in terms of visual field and resolution. The pantograph-type needle structure successfully completed fixation of the CCD camera unit to the abdominal wall. Unit attitude was easily controlled, and fogging could be addressed by water supply before insertion of the CCD camera unit into the peritoneal cavity.

Pulmonary radiological findings for MPA have been scarcely reported to date. This study was conducted to evaluate computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings at the time of MPA diagnosis as predictors for systemic or lung recurrence. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiological data of 55 MPA patients with pulmonary involvement who were admitted to our hospital between April 2008 and December 2016. Results Aside from pulmonary lesions, lesions were found in the kidneys (52.7%), skin (7.3 %), and peripheral nerves (3.6%). Biopsies were performed for 29.1% of the patients, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 78.9%. Parenchymal opacities (74.5%, mainly ground-glass opacities and reticular shadowing) were more commonly seen than airway abnormalities were (40.0%, mainly bronchiectasis). Systemic recurrence in the first year after diagnosis was found in 10.9% of the patients, and it mainly involved the kidneys or lungs. A serum WBC count  10,900/L was a risk factor for predicting systemic recurrence within the first year after diagnosis according to the Cox regression analysis (HR 11.1, 95%CI: 1.3-95.9, p=0.028). Lung recurrence within five years after the diagnosis was observed in 9.1% of the patients. The incidences of reticular shadowing and honeycombing in thoracic CT at diagnosis were significantly higher in recurrence-positive patients than in recurrence-negative patients, but these differences could not be used to predict lung recurrence. Conclusions Ground glass opacities, reticular shadowing, and bronchiectasis are prominent thoracic CT findings for MPA. There are no radiological patterns capable of predicting recurrence. However, a serum WBC count  10,900/L at diagnosis might be a predictive factor for systemic recurrence within the year.","output":"Pulmonary Involvement in Microscopic Polyangiitis: Computed Tomography Findings in 55 Patients With Analysis of Risk Factors for Recurrence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on small and medium-size enterprises' (SMEs') performance by exploring the role of mediating variables such as brand trust (BT) and brand loyalty (BL) in the context of an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach Based on a extend literature review on CSR, BT and BL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of those construct on SMEs' performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. In total, 247 responses were collected from 300 samples. The Smart Partial Least Squares SEM (version) was used to analyze the data of the SMEs of Vietnam in the year 2020. Findings The findings revealed significant and positive relationships among the variables in the model, such as CSR and firm performance (FP), CSR and BT, CSR and BL, as well as the mediating effect of BT and BL between CSR and firm performance. Research limitations/implications First, the sample was composed of small business from different segments, thus the respondents' perspective about CSR can differ according the impact of the business on society. Therefore, future studies could address businesses from a single segment to get a deeper understanding of their knowledge and involvement with CSR. Second, a cross-cultural study in emerging countries can be a rich venue for future research. Third, this study was developed through a quantitative approach;thus, the future research can apply qualitative approach or mixed methods to extend the study findings. Practical implications Managerial level of firm should prioritize noneconomic-related CSR;however, those will ultimately drive financial indicators of FP. The result is reasonable because firm simultaneously keeps committed with its stakeholders by delivering the committed qualification, transparency in operation and consistency in communication, environment respect, employee development and social welfare integrated directly into business activities. Those will result in creating love, trust and admiration from stakeholder, customers for brand and firms will get their engagement and support in many ways. This implication suggests that firm should incorporate CSR strategy into their core business activities and practice properly toward its stakeholders. Social implications This study contributes to the CSR literature in emerging context by shedding light on the roles of CSR in FP with the mediation roles of BT and BL. Most CSR studies focused on Western context as developed economy, thus less attention has been paid for emerging economy. While there is increasing interest CSR in Vietnam, traditional culture and its distinctive economic and political structure has had a great influence on CSR in Vietnam. Thus, this study is important and meaningful for business practitioners, investors, shareholders and policymakers toward sustainable development for firms and Vietnam as a whole. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the mediating role of BT and BL between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of this study may be of great implications to entrepreneurs, top management with respect to strategic perspectives to drive their businesses and to improve their FP in a sustainable direction in contexts of emerging markets. In addition, this finding may be of great interest to motive SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where those businesses are situated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By that understanding, Government may consider for policy reforms/innovation/groundbreaking to leverage businesses to promote their strengths toward sustainable development in the new economic settings.

DISCUSSION: The BOOST pACP program has been developed to stimulate conversations on ACP themes between parent(s) and the adolescents, simultaneously lowering the threshold to discuss similar themes with healthcare professionals, initiating a process of normalization and integration of ACP in standard care. This combined outcome and process evaluation aims to contribute to building the necessary evidence to improve ACP in paediatric oncology.

DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP: Corresponding to the significant proportion of primarily microstructural vascular changes, the radiological diagnosis showed not only macrovascular pathologies, but also diffuse perfusion disorders. PERFORMANCE: Regional hypoperfusion in the lungs can be detected with and without pulmonary arterial embolism. Similar findings can be found in almost all organ systems. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: A therapeutic intervention using low molecular weight heparins in hospitalized patients in situation-adapted dosage is indicated and is discussed in detail. In the detection of micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in the context of COVID-19, extended radiological diagnostics play a central role and are the basis of adapted therapy and secondary prevention.","output":"COVID-19-induzierte Koagulopathien und thromboembolische Manifestationen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this work is to evaluate nurses' experiences, barriers, and facilitators in participating in digital storytelling workshops BACKGROUND: Nurses face ever-increasing demands and work time spent in isolation, leading to burnout. Storytelling-narrative skills of listening and creativity-may encourage meaningful connections with others, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation of the user experiences of storytelling among nurses has been limited. METHOD: The methods used are semistructured individual interviews with 13 nurses from a public health nursing organization who participated in a 3-day digital storytelling workshop in 2019. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed using NVivo12. RESULTS: All participants were women and half were white. Healing, human connection, and nursing pedagogy were the three main themes. Participants highlighted the organizational support in providing a safe and dedicated \\"space\\" for nurses' well-being. They also expressed desire and willingness to participate in additional workshops outside of work hours. CONCLUSION: Further studies using a larger sample are needed to examine the scalability and efficacy of storytelling at work.

A search strategy was built on PubMed with 16 terms related to the theme in the MeSH Terms and Text Word fields. The study was published in 2021 in the Portuguese language. The metadata of the 85 publications were exported for analysis in a spreadsheet under the aspects of entry of the publication in PubMed, time until indexing with the MeSH terms and category of the publication. Results: About 89% of the publications, considering the sample of 62 items with MeSH Terms, had a delay in indexing of at least 15 days;and about 11% collapsed in 15 to 135 days. Conclusion: In order for researchers to be able to retrieve the most scientific content on COVID-19, it is essential that they are constructed of searches that contemplate the use of the MeSH controlled vocabulary term combined with the use of the nomenclature variations of the theme in other fields, such as Text Word, since publications may appear in the search engine, but have not yet been indexed, in order to retrieve a greater number of scientific literature already published. ? 2021 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

Of course, I am speaking primarily of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the massive civil unrest that followed the murders of Breonna Taylor, Daniel Prude, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Jacob Blake. As we are all aware, higher education made unprecedented adjustments and tried to give a semblance of continuity and stability to students. But it is clear that the events of 2020 referred to here, affected and continues to affect students in different ways, and to hugely different extents. On one side, some students are actually thriving with more time to focus on their work and fewer distractions that are sometimes part of campus life. On the other side, we have students who have had family members die, have been separated from family, live in fear of being in a vulnerable population. Students have lost their jobs, struggled to pay for food, been scared to walk alone, have been attacked for simply who they are. Mental health crises in this already vulnerable population increased significantly. The achievement gaps that we all knew existed before 2020, have widened and continue to do so. What can we as educators do to eliminate, or more realistically perhaps, minimize these achievement gaps? Here, I show data from Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 classes showing that 93% and 88%, respectively, of the assignments that were summited more than 5 days late were from students who voluntarily disclosed that they were experiencing a significant life event, general stress, anxiety, or other illness. The overall number of late assignments over these periods was increased by more than 500% compared to the same periods in 2019. Having grade penalties up to and including refusal to accept any late work is not unusual in higher education. Furthermore, time- and project-management are certainly valuable and critical skills we should impart on our students to help prepare them for success after graduation. However, I propose that imposing such standards during times of high stress (even acknowledging the increased stress we educators are also operating under), is ineffective at best, and unethical in many instances. I will discuss alternate strategies for maintaining academic rigor, including peer-evaluations, involving students in their own grading/assessment, and allowing students creative and flexible ways to demonstrate learning outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 Lessons: Compassion and Flexibility are Critical to Equitable Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The chest x-ray (CXR) is the most commonly performed x-ray examination in England, UK. Reporting radiographers provide a cost-effective and safe solution for managing CXR backlogs, but not all Trusts support this service development. This study aimed to establish the service enablers and challenges associated with training and employing radiographers to report CXR images in acute hospital sites in England, UK. METHODS: Approval for this electronic survey was granted in 84 of 146 (58%) Trusts approached. The survey was open for 10 weeks during August to October 2020, comprising of qualitative and quantitative questions. Data was exported in to an Excel spreadsheet where manual thematic analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were also generated. RESULTS: Sample size was 75 (89% response rate). Thirty-three departments (44%) had at least one trainee. Most departments (n = 53, 71%) employ at least one CXR reporting radiographer. A total of 121/160 (76%) radiographers report CXRs. Number of reporting sessions shows progression. Factors enabling training and employment arise from service improvements, financial pressures, and developing the workforce. The main challenges relate to staffing issues with a number of associated sub-themes. A small faction indicated lack of radiographer interest to report CXRs due to litigation worries; possibly uncovering a new and emerging issue. CONCLUSION: Enablers and challenges associated with radiographers reporting CXRs are similar to previous studies. The growth of CXR reporting radiographers and reporting sessions indicates a continuing reliance on radiographers to contributing to managing CXR backlogs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is recommended that potential trainees are explicitly informed of the legal protection that will be provided, to prevent accountability concerns impacting on the continuing progression in this area of advanced practice.","output":"Radiographers reporting chest X-ray images: Identifying the service enablers and challenges in England, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy, reliability, clinical utility, and usability of a wireless fetal and maternal heart rate monitor (HBM) when used by clinicians and pregnant women to monitor fetal heart rate (FHR). Methods: We recruited women aged 18 years or older with a singleton pregnancy of >12 weeks gestation. FHR recordings were performed using the HBM and cardiotocography (CTG) to determine comparative accuracy. The HBM was then used by clinicians and participants in the antenatal clinic with the latter then using the device unassisted to record at home. The women rated the HBM using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: A total of 81 participants provided 126 recordings for analysis. The accuracy of the HBM was excellent compared with CTG, with limits of agreement (95%) between minus 1.5 and plus 0.9 beats per minute (bpm) and a mean difference of minus 0.29 bpm. The FHR was detected on 100% of occasions by clinicians (52 recordings) and participants when used in the clinic (42 recordings) and at home (32 recordings). Home users took an average of 1.1 minutes to detect the FHR and recorded a continuous trace of >1 minute in 94% of occasions, with an average total trace time of 4.4 minutes. The FHR trace was deemed to be clinically useful in 100% of clinician recordings and 97% of home recordings. There was no effect from body mass index, gestational age, pregnancy history, or placental position. The HBM ranked in the 96th to 100th percentile on the SUS for usability and learnability. Conclusions: The HBM was accurate and easy for clinicians and participants to use. The data recorded at home was equivalent to that obtained in the clinic using current assessment protocols for low-risk pregnancies, allowing the device to be used in telehealth consultations.

Its genome has been sequenced continuously by many countries, including Pakistan, but the results vary. Understanding its genomic patterns and connecting them with phenotypic features will help in devising therapeutic strategies. Thus, in this study, we explored the mutation landscape of 250 Pakistani isolates of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to check the genome diversity and examine the impact of these mutations on protein stability and viral pathogenesis in comparison with a reference sequence (Wuhan NC 045512.2). Our results revealed that structural proteins mainly exhibit more mutations than others in the Pakistani isolates; in particular, the nucleocapsid protein is highly mutated. In comparison, the spike protein is the most mutated protein globally. Furthermore, nsp12 was found to be the most mutated NSP in the Pakistani isolates and worldwide. Regarding accessory proteins, ORF3A is the most mutated in the Pakistani isolates, whereas ORF8 is highly mutated in world isolates. These mutations decrease the structural stability of their proteins and alter different biological pathways. Molecular docking, the dissociation constant (K(D)), and MM/GBSA analysis showed that mutations in the S protein alter its binding with ACE2. The spike protein mutations D614G-S943T-V622F (?75.17 kcal/mol), D614G-Q677H (?75.78 kcal/mol), and N74K-D614G (?73.84 kcal/mol) exhibit stronger binding energy than the wild type (?66.34 kcal/mol), thus increasing infectivity. Furthermore, the simulation results strongly corroborated the predicted protein servers.

RECENT FINDINGS Early reports suggested that COVID-19 is an 'atypical ARDS' with profound hypoxemia with normal respiratory system compliance (Crs). Contrarily, several more populated analyses showed that COVID-19 ARDS has pathophysiological features similar to non-COVID-19 ARDS, with reduced Crs, and high heterogeneity of respiratory mechanics, hypoxemia severity, and lung recruitability. There is no evidence supporting COVID-19-specific ventilatory settings, and the vast amount of available literature suggests that evidence-based, lung-protective ventilation (i.e. tidal volume 6 ml/kg, plateau pressure 30 cmH2O) should be enforced in all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Mild and moderate COVID-19 can be managed outside of ICUs by noninvasive ventilation in dedicated respiratory units, and no evidence support an early vs. late intubation strategy. Despite widely employed, there is no evidence supporting the efficacy of rescue therapies, such as pronation, inhaled vasodilators, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. SUMMARY Given the lack of evidence-based specific ventilatory strategies and a large amount of literature showing pathophysiological features similar to non-COVID-19 ARDS, evidence-based lung-protective ventilatory strategies should be pursued in all patients with COVID-19 ARDS.","output":"Ventilation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the leading cause of death since December 2019.

METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted to explore students perceived risks of COVID-19 and preventive measures; sources of COVID-19 information and impacts of the lockdown. Both undergraduate and post-graduate students (n = 398) participated in the study. Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS-26. RESULTS: Students acknowledged COVID-19 as a health risk, and their preventive behaviours were influenced by age, gender, marital status and living situation. Most students followed face mask guidelines but did not comply with lockdown restrictions. Social distancing was not always possible due to overcrowding. Students main sources of COVID-19 information were local media (e.g., TV, radio) and social media. Most students (especially females) were unable to access online learning platforms due to poor internet connectivity, high costs and no access to computers. Meanwhile, a majority of those who studied online did not enjoy the experience. Students experienced depression, frustration, stress and anxiety during the lockdown; became less physically active and spent most of their time on social media, sleeping, eating or watching movies. Some students indulged in smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs and gambling for their first time, while others did them more often than before. CONCLUSION: The increase in sedentary activity, poor mental health and substance use over the lockdown period puts students at risk of health complications and poses a potential threat to the healthcare system. These risks may also negatively impact their future learning and academic potential.

In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS: 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS: The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","output":"Logistical Considerations and Clinical Outcomes Associated With Converting Operating Rooms Into an Intensive Care Unit During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in a New York City Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 context has created the most severe disruption to education systems in recent history.

PARTICIPANTS: Data from participants randomly selected from all states in Nigeria. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Risk perception for COVID-19 infection categorised as risk perceived and risk not perceived. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Compliance to public health and social measures (PHSMs) categorised as compliant; non-compliant and indifferent. ANALYSIS: Comparison of frequencies during both waves using (2) statistic to test for associations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses helped estimate the unadjusted and adjusted odds of risk perception of oneself contracting COVID-19. Level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Triangulated datasets had a total of 6401 respondents, majority (49.5%) aged 25C35 years. Overall, 55.4% and 56.1% perceived themselves to be at risk of COVID-19 infection during the W1 and W2, respectively. A higher proportion of males than females perceived themselves to be at risk during the W1 (60.3% vs 50.3%, p<0.001) and the W2 (58.3% vs 52.6%, p<0.05).

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

Using biochemical assays, we confirmed that K31R and E37K had decreased affinity, and K26R and T92I variants showed increased affinity for S-protein when compared to wildtype ACE2. Consistent with this, soluble ACE2 K26R and T92I were more effective in blocking entry of S-protein pseudotyped virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Human ACE2 receptor polymorphisms and altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This pilot study aimed to investigate the initial effect of a remotely delivered performance-based client-centered intervention on activity performance and participation among adults in the chronic phase after acquired brain injury (ABI).

Assessments were conducted at the baseline, after the 3-month intervention/wait period, and at a 3-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were activity performance using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and participation using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4). The intervention included weekly videoconferencing sessions using the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance approach (tele-CO-OP). The participants identified five functional goals, of which three were directly addressed. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test results showed no significant improvements in the control group at the end of the 3-month wait period. Pooled data from both groups showed significant improvements in COPM scores for trained and untrained goals following the intervention.

However, cancer patients are a heterogeneous population and their corresponding risk may be different. AIM: To compare COVID\\\\19 presentation in patients with active malignancy to those with a history of cancer to determine the impact of cancer status on COVID\\\\19 outcomes in the two groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the 6724 patients who were hospitalized at NYU Langone Health (3/16/20\\\\7/31/20) and tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 580 had either active cancer (n = 221) or a history of cancer (n = 359). We compared the baseline clinicodemographic characteristics and hospital courses of the two groups. We studied the relationship between cancer status and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all\\\\cause mortality. The two groups had similar laboratory results associated with COVID\\\\19 infection, incidence of venous thromboembolism, and incidence of severe COVID\\\\19. Active cancer status was not associated with the rate of ICU admission (p = .307) or use of IMV (p = .236), but was significantly associated with worse all\\\\cause mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis with odds ratios of 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04C2.09; p = .028) and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.12C2.63; p = .014), respectively. CONCLUSION: Active cancer patients had worse survival outcomes compared to patients with a history of cancer despite similar COVID\\\\19 disease characteristics in the two groups.

This study aimed to assess the proportion of missed appointments among pregnant women in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among pregnant women admitted for delivery in Maternity and Children Hospital (MCH), Buraidah. Data were collected on socio-demographics, obstetric history, missed appointments and reasons for missing the appointment. Analysis was carried out in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Medians with interquartile range (IQR) were presented for continuous variables and frequency and proportions for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with the missed appointment. Results A total of 400 women were included in the study. About one-third (30%) of the women had missed at least one ANC appointment in their current pregnancy. The most common reasons for missing the appointments in primary care and hospitals, respectively, were: fear of infection 52% and 47%, facility not working usual 25% and 7.5%, fear of infection to child 19% and 17%. Family size and gravidity were the significant factors associated with missed appointments in our study. Conclusions Nearly one-third of women missed their ANC appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Major reasons were related to COVID-19 fear and its effect on services.

This has led to dramatic variations in surveillance practices among public health agencies, which analyze and present newly confirmed cases by a wide variety of dates. The choice of which date to use should be guided by a balance between interpretability and epidemiological relevance. Report date is easily interpretable, generally representative of outbreak trends, and available in surveillance data sets. These features make it a preferred date for public reporting and visualization of surveillance data, although it is not appropriate for epidemiological analyses of outbreak dynamics. Symptom onset date is better suited for such analyses because of its clinical and epidemiological relevance. However, using symptom onset for public reporting of new confirmed cases can cause confusion because reporting lags result in an artificial decline in recent cases.

The ERGICCERES contact is established by the interaction between TMED9 and SEC12 which generates a short distance opposition (as close as 2C5 nm) between the two compartments. The tight membrane contact allows the ERES-located SEC12 to transactivate COPII assembly on the ERGIC. In addition, a portion of SEC12 also relocates to the ERGIC. Through both mechanisms, the ERGICCERES contact promotes formation of the ERGIC-derived COPII vesicle, a membrane precursor of the autophagosome. The ERGICCERES contact is physically and functionally different from the TFG-mediated ERGICCERES adjunction involved in secretory protein transport, and therefore defines a unique endomembrane structure generated upon stress conditions for autophagic membrane formation.","output":"A new type of ERGICCERES membrane contact mediated by TMED9 and SEC12 is required for autophagosome biogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-viral, pro-survival, and anti-aging effects In light of the research advances on H2S signalling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defence against COVID-19 It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19","output":"H2S as a potential defence against COVID-19?

Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the US or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside of CA, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing.

To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections.

Pandemics and measures undertaken against them may cause changes in behavior; therefore, changes in injury patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak can be expected when compared to the parallel period in previous years. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare injury-related hospitalization patterns during the overall national lockdown period with parallel periods of previous years. METHODS: A retrospective study was completed of all patients hospitalized from March 15 through April 30, for years 2016-2020. Data were obtained from 21 hospitals included in the national trauma registry during the study years. Clinical, demographic, and circumstantial parameters were compared amongst the years of the study. RESULTS: The overall volume of injured patients significantly decreased during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the greatest decrease registered for road traffic collisions (RTCs). Patients sex and ethnic compositions did not change, but a smaller proportion of children were hospitalized during the outbreak. Many more injuries were sustained at home during the outbreak, with proportions of injuries in all other localities significantly decreased. Injuries sustained during the COVID-19 outbreak were more severe, specifically due to an increase in severe injuries in RTCs and falls. The proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations did not change, however more surgeries were performed; patients stayed less days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in number of patients hospitalized due to trauma as compared to parallel periods of previous years. Nevertheless, trauma remains a major health care concern even during periods of high-impact disease outbreaks, in particular due to increased proportion of severe injuries and surgeries.","output":"COVID-19 Changed the Injury Patterns of Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue-resident macrophages and those conscripted from the blood/bone marrow are professional phagocytes.

The obtained data can be transmitted via the Internet to the attending physician for further analysis followed by prescriptions when required. One of these methods is bioradiolocation, which allows noncontact recording of breathing patterns, heart rate and movement of a person during sleep, as well as detection of various sleep disorders and determination of sleep stages. This method is easy to use, and can be recommended for home-screening by patients. Sleep has a significant immunomodulating function, and sleep assessment is important in both patients at risk and afflicted with novel coronavirus infection. Thus, the use of bioradiolocation method at home for non-contact sleep monitoring may be relevant in case of closure of outpatient facilities and will provide the doctor with objective data on sleep patterns and patterns of breathing, motor activity, the presence and amount of respiratory disturbances during sleep.","output":"Benefits of bioradar sleep monitoring in self-isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asian palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), or toddy cats, belong to the family Viverridae.

There is minimal literature regarding its use in common orthopaedic management. Our Minor Injury Unit (MIU) was created due to COVID19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a Penthrox device could improve fracture/joint dislocation management and decreased the need for theatre resources at our MIU. METHODS: We reviewed all cases where Penthrox was used to facilitate minor procedures within a two month period. We recorded patient demographics, injury, time of admission, discharge and management. Success was defined as fracture manipulation into an adequate position, joint congruence achieved or completion of a planned procedure. RESULTS: 101 Penthrox doses were given to 89 patients over 97 episodes between 24/3/2020 and 26/5/2020. No complications were recorded. There was 100% success rate on fracture manipulation. For joint dislocation: 65% on native shoulder reduction; 30% on prosthetic total hip arthroplasty reduction; 100% on native elbow reduction. Penthrox was also used for other procedures such as wound reviews, removing external fixators, and applying braces with 100% success rate.

To build the model, a large database for different countries with a wide range of economic and social institutions was collected. We give a detailed description of the model and a comparison of the results with trajectories of the outbreaks in the countries under consideration. The proposed model describes the empirical results and can be used for timely and contemporary predictions of the stages of pandemics. Despite this, the model needs future development and verification because the pandemic is not over, and the accumulation of empirical information continues.

The most common form of toxic effects of APAP is in the liver where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane with additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects of APAP on pure phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used DOPC, a commonly found phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation of APAP changes pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different concentrations. We used a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), cryo TEM for structural characterization, and neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy to investigate dynamics. We showed that the incorporation of Acetaminophen in the lipid bilayer significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms of its morphology as well as influences the lipid content in the bilayer, causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We discussed how the overall impact of APAP molecules on the pure lipid membrane may play a significant role in the drug's mechanisms of action. Our results showed the incorporation of APAP reduces membrane rigidity as well as changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles into much more irregularly shaped vesicles. Although bilayer structure did not show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM results showed the lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer which causes the overall decreased membrane rigidity.

The primary and secondary clinical outcomes were evaluated with comparisons between patients treated with or without Thymosin-1 therapy. Results: Among 1,388 enrolled patients, 232 patients (16.7%) received both Thymosin-1 therapy and standard therapy (Thymosin-1 group), and 1,156 patients (83.3%) received standard therapy (control group). After propensity score matching (1:1 ratio), baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the Thymosin-1 group and control group. The proportion of patients that progressed to severe COVID-19 is 2.17% for the Thymosin-1 group and 2.71% for the control group (p = 0.736). The COVID-19-related mortality is 0.54% for the Thymosin-1 group and 0 for the control group (p = 0.317).

In the Behavioural Activation in Social IsoLation (BASIL(+)) trial we will test whether a brief psychological intervention (based on Behavioural Activation), delivered remotely, can mitigate depression and loneliness in older adults with long-term conditions during isolation. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial across several research sites, to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the BASIL(+) intervention. Participants will be recruited via participating general practices across England and Wales. Participants must be aged 65 with two or more long-term conditions, or a condition that may indicate they are within a clinically extremely vulnerable group in relation to COVID-19, and have scored 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), to be eligible for inclusion. Randomisation will be 1:1, stratified by research site. Intervention participants will receive up to eight intervention sessions delivered remotely by trained BASIL(+) Support Workers and supported by a self-help booklet. Control participants will receive usual care, with additional signposting to reputable sources of self-help and information, including advice on keeping mentally and physically well. A qualitative process evaluation will also be undertaken to explore the acceptability of the BASIL(+) intervention, as well as barriers and enablers to integrating the intervention into participants existing health and care support, and the impact of the intervention on participants mood and general wellbeing in the context of the COVID-19 restrictions.

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively maintained institutional database to identify all patients with recurrent CVS and treated with stent-retrievers between April 2011 and May 2017. All patients were initially treated with intra-arterial (IA) vasodilators and were subsequently re-treated with stent-retrievers if they developed recurrent vasospasm. Patients were categorized into two groups, those in which IA vasodilators were given again prior to the stent-retriever deployment (VD-first) and those in which the stent-retriever was deployed first and IA vasodilators were given subsequently (SR-first). RESULTS We identified 12 patients (7 females, mean age 54.9 years), 5 in the VD-first and 7 in the SR-first cohorts. Stent-retriever lumen dilatation was attempted in 53 segments (VD-first 14, SR-first 39). Stent-retriever deployment was technically feasible in all cases. Vasodilation occurred in 71.4% (10/14 segments) in the VD-first group and 82.1% (32/39 segments) in SR-first group. Additional treatment was required in 5 segments. There was no recurrent vasospasm in the SR-first group; however, 3 patients (60%) in the VD-first group showed recurrent vasospasm. No angiographical abnormality was found at long-term follow-up (7 patients, mean 29.1 months).

Standardized case definitions that are applicable to variety of populations are critical for robust surveillance systems to guide decision-making regarding RSV control strategies including vaccine evaluation. Limited data exist on performance of RSV syndromic case definitions among young infants or in high-resource settings. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate existing and potential syndromic case definitions for RSV among young infants in an urban, high-income setting using latent class analyses (LCA). METHODS We used data collected on infants <6 months of age tested for RSV as part of routine clinical care at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta between January 2010 and December 2015. We computed the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of clinical features, existing syndromic case definitions used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and alternative definitions we constructed using LCA to detect RSV infection. RESULTS Among 565 infants tested for RSV, 161 (28.5%) had laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Among all case definitions evaluated, the definition developed through LCA (cough plus shortness of breath plus coryza plus wheeze plus poor feeding plus chest in-drawing) was the most specific (95.8%, 95% CI 93.8-97.8) and had the highest positive predictive value (51.4%, 95% CI, 34.9-68.0). WHO-acute respiratory infection (cough or sore throat or shortness of breath or coryza, plus a clinician's judgment that illness is due to infection) was the most sensitive (98.1%, 95% CI, 96.1-100.0; negative predictive value 96.3%, 95% CI 92.2-100.0). CONCLUSIONS The WHO acute respiratory infection definition could be useful for initial screening for RSV among infants <6 months, whereas our alternative syndromic case definition may serve as the strongest confirmatory case definition in the same population.

DESIGN: Living systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: World Health Organization covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature to 25 March 2021, and six additional Chinese databases to 20 February 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised trials of people at risk of covid-19 who were assigned to receive prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. METHODS: Random effects bayesian network meta-analysis was performed after duplicate data abstraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: The first iteration of this living network meta-analysis includes nine randomised trials-six of hydroxychloroquine (n=6059 participants), one of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan (n=234), and two of ivermectin alone (n=540), all compared with standard care or placebo. Two trials (one of ramipril and one of bromhexine hydrochloride) did not meet the sample size requirements for network meta-analysis. Hydroxychloroquine has trivial to no effect on admission to hospital (risk difference 1 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% credible interval 3 fewer to 4 more; high certainty evidence) or mortality (1 fewer per 1000, 2 fewer to 3 more; high certainty). Hydroxychloroquine probably does not reduce the risk of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2 more per 1000, 18 fewer to 28 more; moderate certainty), probably increases adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (19 more per 1000, 1 fewer to 70 more; moderate certainty), and may have trivial to no effect on suspected, probable, or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (15 fewer per 1000, 64 fewer to 41 more; low certainty). Owing to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, and thus very low certainty of evidence, the effects of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory confirmed covid-19 (52 fewer per 1000, 58 fewer to 37 fewer), ivermectin alone on laboratory confirmed infection (50 fewer per 1000, 59 fewer to 16 fewer) and suspected, probable, or laboratory confirmed infection (159 fewer per 1000, 165 fewer to 144 fewer) remain very uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis has trivial to no effect on hospital admission and mortality, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, it is highly uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The objective of the present study was to examine the epidemiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a prospective surveillance study of persons with ILI who presented for care at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela, from October 2006 to December 2010. A respiratory specimen and clinical information were obtained from each participant. Viral isolation and identification with immunofluorescent antibodies and molecular methods were employed to detect respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory sincytial virus, among others. There were 916 participants in the study (median age: 17 years; range: 1 month C 86 years). Viruses were identified in 143 (15.6%) subjects, and one participant was found to have a co-infection with more than one virus. Influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009, were the most frequently detected pathogens, accounting for 67.4% (97/144) of the viruses detected. Adenovirus (15/144), parainfluenza virus (13/144), and respiratory syncytial virus (11/144) were also important causes of ILI in this study. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus became the most commonly isolated influenza virus during its initial appearance in 2009. Two waves of the pandemic were observed: the first which peaked in August 2009 and the second - higher than the preceding - that peaked in October 2009. In 2010, influenza A/H3N2 re-emerged as the most predominant respiratory virus detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza viruses were the most commonly detected viral organisms among patients with acute febrile respiratory illnesses presenting at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus did not completely replace other circulating influenza viruses during its initial appearance in 2009.

Previous studies reported an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. This systematic review aims to describe the clinical features and etiological characteristics of ischemic stroke patients with CO-VID-19 infection. METHOD: A literature search was performed in principal databases for studies and case reports containing data concerning risk factors, clinical features, and etiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 and suffering from stroke. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 14 articles were included for a total of 93 patients. Median age was 65 (IQR: 55C75) years with prevalence in males. Stroke occurred after a median of 6 days from COVID-19 infection diagnosis. Median National of Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19. Cryptogenic (Cry) strokes were more frequent (51.8%), followed by cardioembolic etiology, and they occurred a long time after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with large-artery atherosclerosis strokes (ptrend: 0.03). The clinical severity of stroke was significantly associated with the severity grade of COVID-19 infection (ptrend: 0.03).

In the internal medical practice acquired (secondary), particularly drug-induced immunodeficiencies, are much more frequent than congenital (primary) immunodeficiencies. The management starts as early as the planning phase before initiation of immunosuppression. The risk of infection should be individually stratified and protective vaccinations should be completed. Depending on the immunosuppressive treatment, there can be a necessity for preventive treatment, e.g. for latent tuberculosis infection or hepatitis B. The serological results on varicella zoster virus and JC polyomavirus must also be considered. The basic immunological diagnostics include differential blood count and the determination of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) prior to and during immunosuppressive treatment. Relevant conspicuous laboratory results before initiation of treatment should prompt advanced immunological work-up for the identification of primary immunodeficiencies, which are often accompanied by clinical signs of immune dysregulation.

Patients with chronic severe lymphocytopenia, in particular with CD4 positive T (helper) cells < 200/l, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections so that an antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. In patients with significantly increased proneness to infections and detection of a relevant quantitative (IgG < 4 g/l) and/or qualitative antibody deficiency (impaired vaccine response), additional immunoglobulin replacement therapy may be necessary and can be administered intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG) as home treatment.

METHODS: The study involved 451 participants, including 343 AP patients and 108 healthy controls. We analyzed the association of the three biomarkers with the severity and prognosis of AP. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the mean plasma analyte levels was detected in the study group compared to the control group. Multivariate comparison showed that plasma levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were all significantly different among the three groups at different sampling times (1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th day of admission) (p < 0.01). The combination of the three indicators had significantly higher diagnostic value than either the individual markers or pairwise combinations (p < 0.001). The levels of the three were all significantly higher in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients than in non-SAP patients (p < 0.001); meanwhile, patients with high levels had a worse prognosis than those with low levels (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex, high levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were found to be independently associated with the development of AP. CONCLUSIONS: It dramatically improved the diagnostic power of AP when PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were combined; high PCT, HBP, and IL-6 levels within 3 days of admission may be the potentially useful indicators for predicting SAP.","output":"Combined detection of procalcitonin, heparin-binding protein, and interleukin-6 is a promising assay to diagnose and predict acute pancreatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is a serious concern with the developing economics in India and gets more severe when it has major cities ranked among the top 30 polluted cities worldwide.

High saturated fat diets and being overweight are associated with chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk. Signalling molecules made from saturated fats known as bioactive sphingolipids play essential roles in healthy gastrointestinal immunity. In excess, these sphingolipid molecules can compromise our immune system leading to chronic, low-grade inflammation within the digestive system preceding many metabolic diseases including cancer. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a bioactive sphingolipid and, in excess, contributes to chronic inflammation. Drugs that block sphingosine-1-phosphate activity have the potential to prevent chronic inflammation and reduce gastrointestinal cancer risk. We review how disruption of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation and cancer. We also discuss the use of modulators of the sphingospine-1-phosphate pathway in clinical trials and in the clinic as therapeutics for inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases with the benefit of reducing cancer risk. ABSTRACT: Incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is increasing, and late-stage diagnosis makes these cancers difficult to treat. Chronic and low-grade inflammation are recognized risks for most GI cancers. The GI mucosal immune system maintains healthy homeostasis and signalling molecules made from saturated fats, bioactive sphingolipids, play essential roles in healthy GI immunity. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid, is a key mediator in a balanced GI immune response. Disruption in the S1P pathway underlies systemic chronic metabolic inflammatory disorders, including diabetes and GI cancers, providing a strong rationale for using modulators of the S1P pathway to treat pathological inflammation. Here, we discuss the effects of bioactive sphingolipids in immune homeostasis with a focus on S1P in chronic low-grade inflammation associated with increased risk of GI carcinogenesis. Contemporary information on S1P signalling involvement in cancers of the digestive system, from top to bottom, is reviewed. Further, we discuss the use of novel S1P receptor modulators currently in clinical trials and their potential as first-line drugs in the clinic for chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, ozanimod (Zeposia(TM)) and etrasimod have been approved for clinical use to treat ulcerative colitis and eosinophilic oesophagitis, respectively, which may have longer term benefits in reducing risk of GI cancers.","output":"Targeting Chronic Inflammation of the Digestive System in Cancer Prevention: Modulators of the Bioactive Sphingolipid Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cathodic electrochemiluminescence (CECL) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in aqueous solutions on an aluminum electrode is described.

We test the effectiveness of these salts against viral and bacterial pathogens in animals and humans. We find that aerosol administration of these salts to the airways diminishes the exhalation of the small particles that face masks fail to filter and, in the case of an influenza swine model, completely block airborne transmission of disease. In a study of 10 human volunteers (5 less than 65 years and 5 older than 65 years), we show that delivery of a nasal saline comprising calcium and sodium salts quickly (within 15 min) and durably (up to at least 6 h) diminishes exhaled particles from the human airways. Being predominantly smaller than 1 m, these particles are below the size effectively filtered by conventional masks. The suppression of exhaled droplets by the nasal delivery of calcium-rich saline with aerosol droplet size of around 10 m suggests the upper airways as a primary source of bioaerosol generation. The suppression effect is especially pronounced (99%) among those who exhale large numbers of particles. In our study, we found this high-particle exhalation group to correlate with advanced age.

While our understanding of this new virus is rapidly increasing, gaps remain in our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress host cell antiviral responses. Recent work on other viruses has demonstrated a novel mechanism through which viral proteins can mimic critical regions of human histone proteins. Histone proteins are responsible for governing genome accessibility and their precise regulation is critical for a cells ability to control transcription and respond to viral threats. Here, we show that the protein encoded by ORF8 (Orf8) in SARS-CoV-2 functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motif in histone 3. Orf8 is associated with chromatin, binds to numerous histone-associated proteins, and is itself acetylated within the histone mimic site. Orf8 expression in cells disrupts multiple critical histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) including H3K9ac, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 and promotes chromatin compaction while Orf8 lacking the histone mimic motif does not. Further, SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines and postmortem patient lung tissue cause these same disruptions to chromatin. However, deletion of the Orf8 gene from SARS-CoV-2 largely blocks its ability to disrupt host-cell chromatin indicating that Orf8 is responsible for these effects. Finally, deletion of the ORF8 gene affects the host-cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple cell types and decreases the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung alveolar type 2 (iAT2) pulmonary cells. These findings demonstrate a novel function for the poorly understood ORF8-encoded protein and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Finally, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 encoded protein contains a histone mimic, disrupts chromatin regulation, and enhances replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: The role of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiac arrest (CA) is controversial.

We predicted the probability of a person adopting risk reduction behaviors and the mental distress status using the number of days since their state issued the order relative to those in the non-order states, controlling for COVID-19 prevalence in the state, self-reported symptoms and demographic characteristics. The analysis was conducted in April 2020. Results show that the probability of adopting risk reduction behaviors increased between 8 (avoidance of people with high risk, 87% to 95%) and 27 (use of face mask, 18% to 45%) percentage points in the response period. Mental distress increased by 1.0 point on the PHQ-4 score (from 2.4 to 3.5 point) in the first week and started to drop afterwards. In summary, stay-at-home orders were associated with a differential increase in risk-reduction behaviors. People's mental distress rose in the first week under order and dropped afterwards. While in need for confirmation in longitudinal data, these results suggest that residents are responsive to orders.","output":"Association between state stay-at-home orders and risk reduction behaviors and mental distress amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus has spread worldwide with over 140 million cases and resulting in more than 3 million deaths between November 2019 to April 2021, threatening the socio-economic and psychosocial stability of many families and communities.

However, studies and models trained on specific themed communities are often difficult to apply to different social media platforms and related outcomes. A deep learning framework using thematic structures from Reddit and Twitter can have distinct advantages for studying alcohol abuse, particularly among the youth in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a new deep learning pipeline that uses thematic structures to identify alcohol-related content across different platforms. We apply our method on Twitter to determine the association of the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets with alcohol-related outcomes reported from the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, county health rankings, and the National Industry Classification System. METHODS: The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers neural network learned to classify 1,302,524 Reddit posts as either alcohol-related or control subreddits. The trained model identified 24 alcohol-related hashtags from an unlabeled data set of 843,769 random tweets. Querying alcohol-related hashtags identified 25,558,846 alcohol-related tweets, including 790,544 location-specific (geotagged) tweets. We calculated the correlation between the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets and alcohol-related outcomes, controlling for confounding effects of age, sex, income, education, and self-reported race, as recorded by the 2013-2018 American Community Survey. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed: between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and alcohol consumption (P=.01) and heavy drinking (P=.005) but not binge drinking (P=.37), self-reported at the metropolitan-micropolitan statistical area level; between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and self-reported excessive drinking behavior (P=.03) but not motor vehicle fatalities involving alcohol (P=.21); between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and the number of breweries (P<.001), wineries (P<.001), and beer, wine, and liquor stores (P<.001) but not drinking places (P=.23), per capita at the US county and county-equivalent level; and between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and all gallons of ethanol consumed (P<.001), as well as ethanol consumed from wine (P<.001) and liquor (P=.01) sources but not beer (P=.63), at the US state level.

At the beginning of the epidemic, much attention is paid to person-to-person transmission, disinfection of virus-contaminated surfaces, and social distancing. However, there is much debate about the routes of disease transmission, including airborne transmission, so it is important to elucidate the exact route of transmission of the COVID-19 disease. To this end, the first systematic review study was conducted to comprehensively search all databases to collect studies on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor air environments. In total, 14 relevant and eligible studies were included. Based on the findings, there is a great possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor air environments. Therefore, some procedures are presented such as improving ventilation, especially in hospitals and crowded places, and observing the interpersonal distance of more than 2 m so that experts in indoor air quality consider them to improve the indoor air environments. Finally, in addition to the recommendations of the centers and official authorities such as hand washing and observing social distancing, the route of air transmission should also be considered to further protect health personnel, patients in hospitals, and the public in other Public Buildings.","output":"A systematic review of possible airborne transmission of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) in the indoor air environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilation plays an important role in prevention and control of COVID-19 in enclosed indoor environment and specially in high-occupant-density indoor environments (e.g., underground space buildings, conference room, etc.).

METHODS: Relevant studies published between January 1, 1990, and September 19, 2020, were identified from EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. These studies were then synthesized using thematic analysis. Relevant user experiences with remote care were extracted using line-by-line coding. These codes were summarized into secondary codes and core concepts, which were further merged into overarching themes that encapsulate user experience with remote care. RESULTS: The review included 47 studies, which led to the generation of 5 overarching themes that affect engagement: (1) Convenience relates to time saved by the intervention; (2) Clinical Care relates to perceived quality of care and health outcomes; (3) Communication involves feedback and interaction between patients, staff, and carers; (4) Education concerns the tailored information provided; and (5) Ease of Use relates to accessibility and technical barriers to engagement. Each theme was applied to each user base of patient, carer, and health care professional in a different manner. CONCLUSIONS: The 5 themes identified highlight aspects of remote care that facilitate engagement, and should be considered in both future design and trials evaluating these technologies.","output":"Factors Affecting Patient and Physician Engagement in Remote Health Care for Heart Failure: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Process analytical technology (PAT) for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is defined by an integrated set of advanced and automated methods that analyze the compositions and biophysical properties of cell culture fluids, cell-free product streams, and biotherapeutic molecules that are ultimately formulated into concentrated products.

We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies. METHODS: We described the clinical presentation, the diagnostic approach and the therapeutic outcomes of our MIS-C patient. Parallel to this, we conducted a systematic literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, focusing on gastrointestinal MIS-C. RESULTS: Our patient was initially assessed by the surgical team due to his query acute abdomen. Following the diagnosis of MIS-C with myocarditis, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gr/Kg single infusion) were promptly started, leading to clinical improvement. According to our literature search, patients with MIS-C have a high rate of severe abdominal symptoms resembling surgical emergencies (appendicitis, obstruction, etc.) and a not negligible number of those patients have been surgically explored with variable findings. CONCLUSIONS: We encourage pediatric surgeons in the upcoming months of COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate myocardial function prior to surgical abdominal exploration. In children with query acute abdomen, MIS-C should be promptly ruled out in order to avoid unnecessary surgeries that could worsen the already frail outcome of this new syndrome. Nevertheless, it should be considered that MIS-C might well encompass complications (e.g. appendicitis, segmental intestinal ischemia) which need swift surgical treatment.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

Most testing guidelines recommend observational or functional assays that, based on studies in laboratory animals, are able to detect changes in immune function that are associated with increased susceptibility to infectious or neoplastic cell challenge. To appreciate how well observational and functional endpoints are likely to predict an increased risk of infection in humans, it is important to establish correlations between alterations in human immune function and an increased risk of disease. This review will address the clinical evidence for increased risk of disease in humans with mild to moderate levels of immunosuppression using examples from the literature, discuss specific immune system defects associated with increased rates of infection, and examine factors that impact the interpretation of clinical data. The most comprehensive data bases that address these relationships, those derived from patients with primary immunodeficiency and AIDS, are not discussed in this review. These are extreme examples of immunodeficiency and neither the specific clinical diseases that result, nor eventual outcomes, have much in common with that which occurs in individual with chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression.","output":"Suppression of immune function and susceptibility to infections in humans: association of immune function with clinical disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study the extent of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 with quantitative CT (QCT) and to assess the impact of disease burden on opacity visibility on chest radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 20 pairs of CT scans and same-day chest radiographs from 17 patients with COVID-19, along with 20 chest radiographs of controls. All pulmonary opacities were semi-automatically segmented on CT images, producing an anteroposterior projection image to match the corresponding frontal chest radiograph. The lung opacification mass (QCTmass) was defined as [(opacity attenuation value+1000 HU)/1000]*1.065(g/mL) * combined volume (cm(3)) of the individual opacities. Eight thoracic radiologists reviewed the 40 radiographs, and a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed for the detection of lung opacities. Logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors affecting opacity visibility on chest radiographs. RESULTS: The mean QCTmass per patient was 72.4120.8 g (range, 0.7-420.7), and opacities occupied 3.25.8% (range, 0.1-19.8) and 13.918.0% (range, 0.5-57.8) of the lung area on the CT images and projected images, respectively. The radiographs had a median sensitivity of 25% and specificity of 90% among radiologists. Nineteen of 186 opacities were visible on chest radiographs, and a median area of 55.8% of the projected images was identifiable on radiographs. Logistic regression analysis showed that QCTmass (p<0.001) and combined opacity volume (p<0.001) significantly affected opacity visibility on radiographs. CONCLUSION: QCTmass varied among COVID-19 patients. Chest radiographs had high specificity for detecting lung opacities in COVID-19, but a low sensitivity. QCTmass and combined opacity volume were significant determinants of opacity visibility on radiographs. An earlier incorrect version appeared online.

We survey the history and mechanism of coronaviruses, and the structural characteristics of the spike protein and its key residues responsible for human transmissions. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review to summarize the origin, transmission and etiology of COVID-19. The structural analysis of the spike protein and its disordered residues explains the mechanism of the viral transmission. A meta-data analysis of the therapeutic compounds targeting the SARS-CoV-2 is also included. RESULTS: Coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and infect humans with unexpected consequences for public health. The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher compared to that of the closely related SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, intrinsically disordered regions are observed at the interface of the spike protein and ACE2 receptor, providing a shape complementarity to the complex. The key residues of the spike protein have stronger binding affinity with ACE2. These can be probable reasons for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we have also discussed the therapeutic compounds and the vaccines to target SARS-CoV-2, which can help researchers to develop effective drugs/vaccines for COVID-19. The overall history and mechanism of entry of SARS-CoV-2 along with structural study of spike-ACE2 complex provide insights to understand disease pathogenesis and development of vaccines and drugs.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak: history, mechanism, transmission, structural studies and therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Established theories of the policy process recognize the challenges governments face in processing information.

Technological solutions have the potential to improve the health of patients and help to reduce costs. Acceptability is a prerequisite for the use and a successful implementation of new disruptive technologies. This qualitative study aimed to explore determinants that influence the acceptance of patients and their informal caregivers regarding a patient-oriented digital decision-making solutiona doctor-at-home system. DESIGN: We applied a semistructured design using an interview guide that was based on a theoretical framework influenced by established acceptance theories. The interviews were analysed using a content analysis. SETTING: A multicentred study in four European countries. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 49 patients and 33 of their informal caregivers. Most of the patients were male (76%) and aged between 60 and 69 years (43%). Informal caregivers were mostly female (85%). The majority of patients (55%) suffered from heart failure with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Four main categories emerged from the data: needs and expectations, preferences regarding the care process, perceived risk and trust. Participants expressed clear wishes and expectations regarding a doctor-at-home, especially the need for reassurance and support in the management of heart failure. They were receptive to changes to the current healthcare processes. However, trust was identified as an important basis for acceptance and use. Finally, perceived risk for decision-making errors is a crucial topic in need of attention. CONCLUSION: Patients and informal caregivers see clear benefits of digitalisation in healthcare. They perceive that an interactive decision-making system for patients could empower and enable effective self-care. Our results provide important insights for development processes of patient-centred decision-making systems by identifying facilitators and barriers for acceptance. Further research is needed, especially regarding the influence and mitigation of patients and informal caregivers perceived risks.","output":"Determinants of acceptance of patients with heart failure and their informal caregivers regarding an interactive decision-making system: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2020, the U.S. government began to implement a new Public Charge rule that greatly expands the definition of public charge when determining admissibility for legal permanent residency (LPR).

However, predicting future use based on characteristics measured at the time of application, such as English language proficiency and income, is difficult. We evaluate the risk of being deemed inadmissible as well as the likelihood of using public assistance by regional group. Using a sample of recently arrived LPRs in the 2013C2017 American Community Survey, we find that Mexicans/Central Americans face disproportionate risk of being deemed a public charge despite their relatively low public assistance use.

However, PRV infection in humans is rare and to the best of knowledge, PRV has never been isolated from human cases before. METHODS: Four acute encephalitis cases in humans were confirmed as PRV infection based on clinical symptoms, laboratory diagnosis, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and applied for virus isolation. Etiological and genetic characteristics of this PRV human isolate were further determined. RESULTS: The patients manifested respiratory dysfunction and acute neurological symptoms. The mNGS revealed PRV specific nucleotide sequences in patients' CSF samples (7-6198 reads and 0.2446%-80.58% coverage). The PRV envelope glycoprotein B antibody, glycoprotein E antibody, and neutralizing antibody were positively detected. For the first time, a PRV strain, designated hSD-1/2019, was isolated and identified from one CSF sample, and transmission electron microscopy revealed hSD-1/2019 had typical morphology similar to swine PRV. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that hSD-1/2019 was genetically closest to those PRV variant strains currently circulating in pigs in China, and this strain showed similar etiological characteristics to Chinese PRV variant strains, while different from Chinese classical strain. Moreover, hSD-1/2019 showed high pathogenicity and induced acute neurological symptoms in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: A PRV strain was isolated from an acute human encephalitis case.

Result Immuno-informatics analysis of S protein using IEDB identified only one B cell epitope 1054 QSAPH 1058 as linear, surface and antigenic. Although 1054 QSAPH 1058 was estimated as non-allergic and non-toxic, it showed protein instability. Moreover, around 45 discontinuous epitopes were also recognized as different exposed surface area. In MHCI methods, six conserved stable and safe epitopes ( 898 FAMQMAYRF 906, 258 WTAGAAAYY 266 and 2 FVFLVLLPL 10 , 202 KIYSKHTPI 210 , 712 IAIPTNFTI 720 and 1060 VVFLHVTYV 1068 ) were identified. These epitopes showed strong interaction when docked with TLR8 and HLA-B7 allele especially 1060 VVFLHVTYV 1068 and 2 FVFLVLLPL 10 epitopes. Three epitopes were also predicted ( 898 FAMQMAYRF 906, 888 FGAGAALQI 896 and 342 FNATRFASV 350 ) using MHCII methods. Furthermore, the potential multi-epitopes were acquired by assessing allergenicity, toxicity and cross-reactivity to prevent autoimmunity. Conclusion The multi-epitopes vaccine was predicted based on Bioinformatics tools that may provide reliable results in a shorter time and at a lower cost. However, further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to validate their effectiveness.","output":"Epitope\\\\based peptide vaccine design against spike protein (S) of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV): an immunoinformatics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To explore the association between accessing antenatal care information through hospitals' official new media accounts and antenatal care knowledge and individual prevention behavior under COVID-19 epidemic, and to provide evidence for improving the emergency plan for maternity health care services in China under public health emergencies. Methods The online survey was conducted from Feb 5th to Mar 1st, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Approaches of accessing antenatal care information, COVID-19 related antenatal care knowledge and individual prevention behavior was collected via cross-sectional design. Results A total of 1 936 valid questionnaires were obtained from 21 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Under the COVID-19 epidemic, 75.4% of the pregnant women reported they got institutional service and health education information from hospitals' official new media accounts such as WeChat and Weibo. Multivariate Logistic analysis showed that pregnant women who received information from official accounts of new media had higher scores of COVID-19 relevant antenatal care knowledge (aOR=1.36, 95%CI:1.08-1.71, P<0.01)and individual prevention behaviors(aOR=1.46, 95%CI:1.18-1.82, P<0.01) than those who obtained information from other sources. Conclusion The access to antenatal care knowledge via hospitals' official social media accounts was associated with better antenatal care knowledge and individual prevention behaviors among pregnant women. Under major public health emergency, it is suggested for health institutions to disseminate antenatal health care information via hospitals' official accounts in new media like Wechat and Weibo. Appropriate training should be developed to ensure the quality of health education and service provision in official new media accounts. ? 2021, Editorial Department of Fudan University Journal of Medical Sciences.

IDO expression by LN pDCs was closely dependent on MHCII-mediated, antigen-dependent, interactions with Treg. We further established that IDO production by pDCs was necessary to confer suppressive function to Tregs. During EAE development, IDO expression by pDCs was required for the generation of Tregs capable of dampening the priming of encephalitogenic T cell and disease severity.

The potential benefit of prone positioning maneuvers during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the use of prone positioning during extracorporeal support and ICU mortality in a pooled population of patients from previous European cohort studies. METHODS: We performed a pooled individual patient data analysis of European cohort studies which compared patients treated with prone positioning during ECMO (Prone group) to conventional ECMO management (Supine group) in patients with severe ARDS. RESULTS: 889 patients from five studies were included. Unadjusted ICU mortality was 52.8% in the Supine Group and 40.8% in the Prone group. At a Cox multiple regression analysis PP during ECMO was not significantly associated with a reduction of ICU mortality (HR 0.67 95% CI: 0.42C1.06). Propensity score matching identified 227 patients in each group. ICU mortality of the matched samples was 48.0% and 39.6% for patients in the Supine and Prone group, respectively (p = 0.072). CONCLUSIONS: In a large population of ARDS patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal support, the use of prone positioning during ECMO was not significantly associated with reduced ICU mortality.

The present work aimed to characterize the clinical features of pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 before and after the emergence of P.1. METHODS: This is a cohort study. Data of symptomatic patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR tests registered in Painel COVID-19 Amazonas were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4080 symptomatic pediatric patients were identified in the database between March 2020 and July 2021, of which 1654 were categorized as pre-P.1 and 978 as P.1-dominant cases, based on the prevalence of P.1 of >90% in the North Region, Brazil. Lower case-fatality rate was observed in non-infants infected during the P.1-dominant period (0.9% vs. 2.2%). In general, patients infected during the P.1-dominant period had less fever (70.8% vs. 74.2%) and less lower respiratory tract symptoms (respiratory distress: 11.8% vs. 18.9%, dyspnea: 27.9% vs. 34.5%) yet higher prevalence of neurological symptoms, headache for example (42.8% vs. 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptoms of COVID-19 can differ across different periods of variant dominance. Lower prevalence of fever during the P.1-dominant period may reduce the effectiveness of symptom-based screening in public premises where laboratory diagnostic tests are not available. IMPACT: The prevalence rate of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection can differ among different variants.

We estimated rate of positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 in a population of healthy pregnant women, compared to a population of non-pregnant women of the same age and geographic area. We also made a comparison between the two groups in terms of previous symptoms and lifestyle. This is a transversal study including pregnant women, above 18 weeks of gestation, aged between 18 and 40 years.

Its aim was to compare the activities of proteases and their inhibitors in the hemolymph of workers reared in a small-cell comb (SMC) and a standard-cell comb (STC) in colonies kept simultaneously on standard- and small-cell combs. The width of comb cells in which workers are reared has a significant effect on the protein concentration and the proteolytic system in the hemolymph, which is reflected in the activities of proteases and their inhibitors. The protein concentrations in the 1-day-old workers were always higher (p  0.05) in the SMC than STC workers. The opposite was found in the older bee workers (aged 7, 14 and 21 d). The activities of proteases and their inhibitors in the 1-day-old workers were always higher (usually significantly at p  0.05) in STC than SMC workers, and opposite results were observed in the groups of the older workers (aged 7, 14 and 21 d). The differences between the workers from small-cell combs and those reared in standard-cell combs may be related to their different tasks. Workers reared in small-cell combs probably work as foragers outside the nest, whereas bees reared in standard-cell combs work in the nest. This hypothesis requires confirmation.

METHODS: We present a retrospective cohort study of 75 kidney transplants in patients who recovered from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 performed across 22 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020, to January 31, 2021. We detail demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR tests, normal chest imaging with complete resolution of symptom for at least 28 d and significant social distancing for 14 d before surgery. RESULTS: Clinical severity in patients ranged from asymptomatic (n = 17, 22.7%), mild (n = 36.48%), moderate (n = 15.20%), and severe (n = 7.9.3%) disease. Median duration between PCR positive to transplant was 60 d (overall) and increased significantly from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe disease (49, 57, 83, 94 d, P 0.019), respectively.

Specifically, we position the pandemic as an unsettled time (Swidler 1986) and examine how different racialized groups made sense of the economic and health risks posed during this unprecedented period. We find that even when accounting for economic precarity and potential exposure to COVID-19, as well as for various other measures of social status, racialized minorities felt significantly more threatened by COVID-19 than did whites. Religion and political ideology mediated this relationship to some degree, but the racialized differences were substantial. Indeed, we find that even the most liberal whites reported being significantly less concerned about some COVID-19 risks than the most politically conservative of our Latinx and Black respondents. By linking the literature on race and racial stratification with research on risk and culture, we argue that whiteness facilitates a cognitive insulating effect vis--vis COVID-19 risks. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and conclude by highlighting the enduring importance of racialization, including various manifestations of white privilege, when assessing the social and cultural realities of crises on the ground.","output":"Race and Ideology in a Pandemic: White Privilege and Patterns of Risk Perception during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: to describe the experience of a private outpatient network for hematology and oncology treatment in the adoption of management tools to face the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2.

Specifically, whereas these types of problems are commonly studied using particle simulations of stochastic differential equation models, here the corresponding partial differential equation model is solved using a method based on deep neural networks. The results illustrate that the neural network method is synergistic with the time-integrated Smoluchowski model: together, these are used to construct continuous mappings from key physical inputs (applied voltage and particle diameter) to key output metrics (mean first passage time and effective mobility). In particular, this capability is a unique advantage of the time-integrated Smoluchowski model over the corresponding stochastic differential equation models.

However, dsRNA is also present in many cellular RNAs, raising a question of how these receptors and effectors discriminate between viral and cellular dsRNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that innate immune sensors detect not only dsRNA structure but also other and often multiple features of RNA such as length, sequence, cellular location, post-transcriptional processing and modification, which are divergent between viral and cellular RNAs.

These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated changes in COVID prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours. METHODS: An Australia-wide (national) survey was conducted in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Participants who were adults (18+ years), currently residing in Australia and who could read and understand English were eligible. Recruitment was via online social media. Analysis sample included those who provided responses to the baseline survey (April) and at least one subsequent follow-up survey (N = 1834 out of a possible 3216 who completed the April survey). 71.7% of the sample was female (n = 1,322). Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. PCA identified two behaviour types: distancing (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and hygiene (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing and hygiene behaviours were analysed individually using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: On average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). Distancing behaviours declined each month (ps < .001), whereas hygiene behaviours remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (ps<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that ones actions could prevent infection of family members (p < .001). CONCLUSION: High adherence to COVID prevention behaviours were reported in this social media sample; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours.

Apart from clinical relevance and containment, for specific questions, it might be of interest to (re)investigate cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results, even though these cases might neither be clinically relevant nor significant for containment measures, because they might probably not be infectious. In order to expand the diagnostic bandwidth for non-routine questions, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens associated with high CT values, we combined the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This expansion can help to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections without the demand of confirmative antibody testing, which requires to summon patients again for blood sampling few to several weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics. This allows a reliable interpretation of RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR. After laboratory implementation, we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 5 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases, mainly exhibiting mild and heterogeneous presentation-apart from a single case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2, who was hospitalized in the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. The tested biotinylated primers do not negatively affect the RT-qPCR pipeline and thus can be optionally applied to enable deeper inspection of RT-qPCR results by subsequent pyrosequencing.

Winds often transport the pathogens initial inoculum from one country to another. Our findings trigger an alert to the whole world about developing races capable of supplanting leaf rust resistance. ABSTRACT: Characterization of the genetic structure and the physiological races of Puccinia triticina is a growing necessity to apply host genetic resistance against wheat leaf rust as a successful control strategy. Herein, we collected and identified about 130 isolates of P. triticina from 16 Egyptian commercial wheat cultivars grown at different locations, over two seasons (2019/2020 and 2020/2021). The 130 isolates of P. triticina were segregated into 17 different physiological races. TTTST and TTTKS were the most common virulent races, whereas TTTST and MTTGT were the most frequent races. The races were classified into three groups, based on their distinct DNA band sizes (150 bp, 200 bp, and 300 bp) after RAPD analysis. The new wheat cultivars (Sakha-94, Sakha-95, and Shandweel-1) infected with the most virulent race (TTTST), Gemmeiza-12, and Misr-3 were resistant to all physiological races. The resistance of these cultivars was mostly due to the presence of Lr19- and Lr28-resistant genes.

CASE We present a patient who developed Bacteroides fragilis sacral osteomyelitis and discitis after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with synthetic monofilament mesh and sacral titanium coil fixation. The patient had undergone dental extraction of 3 infected teeth approximately 2 weeks before sacrocolpopexy for stage IV apical vaginal prolapse. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed sacral osteomyelitis and discitis along with Bacteroides fragilis bacteremia approximately a week and a half after the original surgery. The patient was followed up with serial MRIs of the spine which revealed degeneration at the sacral promontory. The patient underwent successful removal of the entire mesh and sacral titanium coils with resolution of her symptoms. Follow-up MRI of the spine revealed resolution of her sacral osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS Sacral osteomyelitis is a rare complication after sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse repair. There should be a high index of suspicion for patients presenting with disproportionate low back pain and vague symptoms after surgery. Recent oral surgery may increase the risk of bacteremia and subsequent infectious morbidity after sacrocolpopexy with the use of synthetic mesh for prolapse repair.","output":"Sacral osteomyelitis after laparoscopic sacral colpopexy performed after a recent dental extraction: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces CODA-19, a human-annotated dataset that codes the Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, and Other sections of 10,966 English abstracts in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset.

Despite a growing literature on economic evaluation of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including several systematic reviews, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. This paper reviews the methodology used to determine their cost-effectiveness and assesses whether this meets the requirements for decision-making. In doing so we consider the challenges specific to the economic evaluation of DMHIs, and identify where consensus and possible further research is warranted. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to identify all economic evaluations of DMHIs published between 1997 and December 2018. The searches included databases of published and unpublished research, reference lists and citations of all included studies, forward citations on all identified protocols and conference abstracts, and contacting authors researchers in the field. The identified studies were critiqued against a published set of requirements for decision-making in healthcare, identifying methodological challenges and areas where consensus is required. RESULTS The review identified 67 papers evaluating DMHIs. The majority of the evaluations were conducted alongside trials, failing to capture all relevant available evidence and comparators, and long-term impact of mental health disorders. The identified interventions are complex and heterogeneous. As a result, there are a number of challenges specific to their evaluation, including estimation of all costs and outcomes, conditional on analysis viewpoint, and identification of relevant comparators. A taxonomy for DMHIs may be required to inform what interventions can reasonably be pooled and compared.

We hypothesized that the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a neighborhood census-block-level composite measure, was associated with COVID-19 mortality independently of race, ethnicity, and other patient factors. RESEARCH DESIGN Multicenter retrospective cohort study examining COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. SUBJECTS Inclusion required hospitalization with positive SARS-CoV-2 test or COVID-19 diagnosis at three large Midwestern academic centers. MEASURES The primary study outcome was COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Patient-level predictors included age, sex, race, insurance, body mass index, comorbidities, and ventilation. Neighborhoods were examined through the national ADI neighborhood deprivation rank comparing in-hospital mortality across ADI quintiles. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression with fixed site effects. RESULTS Among 5999 COVID-19 patients median age was 61 (interquartile range: 44-73), 48% were male, 30% Black, and 10.8% died. Among patients who died, 32% lived in the most disadvantaged quintile while 11% lived in the least disadvantaged quintile; 52% of Black, 24% of Hispanic/Latino, and 8.5% of White patients lived in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.Living in the most disadvantaged neighborhood quintile predicted higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-2.67) independent of race.

This study aimed to study the metabolic risk factors and the association with blood pressure alteration. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between 2017 and 2018 among 284 male university students in Eastern province, Saudi Arabia. The obesity and cardiovascular measurements were taken using standardized instruments, including blood pressure (BP), mean arterial pressure, body mass index (BMI), body adiposity index (BAI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (BFP), and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Statistical Analysis: Blood pressure was classified according to the United States of America, Sixth Joint National committee (JNC-VI) guidelines. The mean and standard error were calculated for each hypertension group variable. Logistic regression was applied to predict associations. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in the present study was 61.6%., and that of overweight and obesity was 16.5% and 34.9%, respectively. The cut-off values of BMI and WC were 22.23 and 75.24, respectively. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR significantly predict hypertension and that WC has a greater discrimination capacity than other measures.

The data published in the month of October were included to carry out the prediction. The results show a satisfactory comparison between the real data and those obtained by both models with a R2 > 0.999. The Levenberg-Marquardt and BFGS quasi-Newton optimization algorithm were favorable for fitting the coefficients during learning in the ANN model due to their fast and precision, respectively.

A network diagram of drug-component-target was further established using the Cytoscape 3.6.0 software. The effect of fisetin on Walker 256 cell proliferation was observed by clone formation assay and EDU assay, and the interaction between fisetin and AKT was revealed using the immunoprecipitation assay. Effects of fisetin on AKT/HIF-1 signaling pathway in Walker 256 cells were ultimately detected using Western blot and qPCR assays. RESULTS: The key component fisetin and core target gene AKT were sorted out using the drug-component-target network with a binding energy between fisetin and AKT less than ?5 kcal/mol.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases. Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of IFN- from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The investigated extracts were: Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), and Tonsipret (TOP). Methods The inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of Spike S1 protein and the human ACE2 receptor was measured by ELISA. The effects on intracellular IFN- expression in stimulated human PBMCs were measured by flow cytometry. Regulation on HBD1 and LL-37 expression and secretion was assessed in 25d long-term cultured human lung A549 epithelial cells by RT-PCR and ELISA. Results IMU and BRO TE concentration-dependently inhibited the interaction between spike protein and the ACE2 Receptor. However, this effect was only observed in the cell-free assay at a concentration range which was later on determined as cytotoxic to human PBMC. SINx, TOP and BRO TP significantly upregulated the intracellular expression of antiviral IFN from stimulated PBMC. Co-treatment of A549 cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly upregulated mRNA expression (IMU) and release (IMU and BRO TP) of HBD1 and LL-37 (BRO TP).

We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, triggering melting initiation. dsRNA destabilization driven by N-NTD was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS.

Italy is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 disease, and it has registered high COVID-19 death rates and the death toll. In this article, we analyzed different Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level for the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. The analysis pipeline includes the following steps. After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices (reported in Supplementary file). Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behaviour. Then, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e. how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","output":"Statistical and network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data: communities detection and temporal evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of disinfectants is part of the everyday life of people, especially in the medical profession. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of disinfectants continues to increase and is of fundamental importance in infection control. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of sensitization and the value of patch testing to didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) and the alcohols ethanol, 1-propanol, and isopropanol. METHODS: Clinical patch test data of 145 patients with suspected contact allergy to disinfectants were retrospective analysed. RESULTS: Among the 145 patients patch tested with the different alcohols, only one nurse was detected with a possible allergy to 1-propanol. Additional patch testing in 84 patients with DDAC 0.05% resulted in five patients with weakly positive reactions only, without clinical relevance. Patch testing with DDAC 0.03% showed no positive reactions at all on day 3 readings. CONCLUSIONS: DDAC and alcohols are rarely responsible for allergic contact dermatitis.

A total of 82 patients with stage I-II (FIGO 2014) ovarian clear cell carcinoma undergoing primary surgery at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2017 were enrolled. PNI was calculated using the formula: 10  serum albumin (g/ dL) + 0.005  peripheral blood lymphocyte count (/mm3). Preoperative PNI exhibited relatively high area under the curve value (0.709) for 5 year survival, and the optimal cutoff value was 46.5. The overall survival was significantly shorter in the PNI-low group than in the PNI-high group. Multivariate analysis showed that high PNI was a significant independent prognostic factor for favorable prognosis (hazard ratio = 0.102, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.220), but the postrecurrence survival was significantly longer in the PNI-high group than in the PNI-low group (p = 0.0383).

In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones. Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.","output":"Vulnerability to severe forms of COVID-19: an intra-municipal analysis in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD).

In the present study, we explored the interplay between PCV2 replication and the UPS in PK15 cells and found that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132 and lactacystin) significantly decreased the PCV2 titer at the early infection stage. We further revealed that inhibition of the UPS did not affect virus entry but decreased viral protein expression and RNA transcription potentially in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PCV2 infection has little effect on the chymotrypsin-like activity, and the gene-silencing of ubiquitin reduced the PCV2 titer, which indicates that the effective replication of PCV2 may be related to protein ubiquitination.

CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with worsening nausea, vomiting, and exertional dyspnea for 3 weeks. Initial examination showed blood pressure 182/108 mmHg without skin thickening or other skin manifestations. Laboratory investigations showed serum creatinine level 21.73 mg/dL and diffuse airspace opacities on chest radiography. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on emergent hemodialysis. He was anemic and became gradually hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive for centromere pattern with titer of 320. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies were negative. He was started on therapeutic plasmapheresis (TP) and captopril, which resulted in significant improvement of respiratory symptoms. The kidney biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. Anticentromere, anti-Scl-70, and antiribonucleic acid polymerase III antibodies, drawn after 4 sessions of TP, were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report a rare case of ssSSc with renal crisis in a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and suspected pulmonary hemorrhage.

Despite their widespread use, no research to date has examined either why people use them (i.e., motivations) or how their usage makes people feel (i.e., well-being effects). Through the uses and gratifications theory supported by a sequential mixed-method approach (interviews N = 10 and survey N = 536), we provide three overarching contributions. First, based on prior literature and a qualitative study, we identify nine motivations that can potentially drive AR face filter usage on Instagram. Our survey indicates that seven of those motivations (e.g., creative content curation, social interactions) are significant drivers of usage behaviours, while two (true self-presentation and silliness) did not have a significant impact. Second, we provide nuanced insights into the multi-faceted nature of the self-presentation motives underpinning AR face filter use (ideal, true and transformed self-presentation). Lastly, we show filter usage can have both positive and negative well-being effects depending on the underlying motivation.

AEs affected 2756/4498 (61.3%) of ocrelizumab-exposed patients. The most common AEs were infections (n=1342, 39.2% of ocrelizumab-exposed patients) and infusion-related reactions (n=1391, 26.2%). Compared to beta-interferon, ocrelizumab-exposed patients were more likely to experience an infection (Risk Ratio (RR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.01-1.19), including: herpes virus-related (RR=1.75;95%CI:1.11-2.76), upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RR=1.42;95%CI:1.10-1.84 and RR=1.61;95%CI:1.10-2.35), nasopharyngitis (RR=1.47;95%CI:1.13-1.90) and rhinitis (RR=4.00;95%CI:1.13-14.14).

However, discharge standards required additional advanced treatment technologies, and the removal of low phosphorus concentration is complicated and expensive. This study proposes application of a simple and recyclable adsorbent to remove low-concentration phosphorus from water. The removal efficiency of phosphorus from low-strength synthetic wastewater was investigated and the adsorption mechanism was analyzed. When the initial phosphorus concentration was 2.0a?mg/L, the phosphorus adsorption capacity of Ca-GAT increased to 0.891a?mg/g from 0.074a?mg/g for GAT at 298a?K and pH of 7. Phosphorus adsorption on Ca-GAT performs well when the solution pH is in the range of 5-10, and it is not conducive to the adsorption reaction when the solution pH exceeds 11. The competing anions (such as NO3-, SO42-, HCO3- and F-) existed, Ca-GAT still performed better in removing phosphorus. Then, the saturated absorbents could be effectively regenerated with a 0.5a?mos/L NaOH solution, while desorption efficiency was reduced from 97.11% to 33.06% after fifth regeneration cycle. Finally, Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated that the Ca2+ content on the Ca-GAT surface played an important role in capturing phosphate ions from wastewater. Phosphorus was mainly removed via the formation of Ca-phosphorus precipitation. To some extent, ligand exchanges of CO32- and OH- with HPO42- and H2PO4- were also beneficial for phosphorus removal. The present work shows that attapulgite has sustainable and beneficial potential in the removal of low-strength phosphorous in wastewater, and the phosphorus loaded adsorbent can be used in the agriculture as slow-release fertilizer.","output":"Calcium-modified granular attapulgite removed phosphorus from synthetic wastewater containing low-strength phosphorus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical resection is the standard-of-care approach for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Surgery is also considered an acceptable standard infit patients with oligometastatic lesions in the lungs The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide issues with access to operating room time, with patients and physicians facing uncertainty as to when surgical resection will be available, with likely delays of months Further compounding this are concerns about increased risks of respiratory complications with lung cancer surgery during active phases of the pandemic In this setting, many thoracic oncology teams are embracing a paradigm where stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is used as a bridge, to provide radical-intent treatment based on a combination of immediate SABR followed by planned surgery in 3C6 months This pragmatic approach to treatment has been named SABR-BRIDGE (Stereotactic ABlative Radiotherapy Before Resection to avoId Delay for early-stage lunG cancer or oligomEts) This term has also been applied to the pragmatic study of the outcomes of this approach In this paper, we discuss the standards of care in treatment of early-stage (NSCLC) and pulmonary oligometastases, the impetus for the SABR-BRIDGE approach, and the controversies surrounding assessment of pathological response to neo-adjuvant radiation therapy","output":"SABR-BRIDGE: Stereotactic ABlative Radiotherapy Before Resection to AvoId Delay for Early-Stage LunG Cancer or OligomEts During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preparedness for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread in India calls for setting up of adequately equipped and dedicated health facilities to manage sick patients while protecting healthcare workers and the environment.

In conclusion, we demonstrate cross-culturally that attachment security is a major predictor of relationship quality during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, whereas fear, pathogenic threat, sexual behavior, and the severity of governmental regulations did not significantly influence the accuracy of prediction.","output":"Securing Your Relationship: Quality of Intimate Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic Can Be Predicted by Attachment Style"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN Expert workgroup consensus, focused literature review, and vetting via feedback from international presentations and spinal cord professional membership groups. OBJECTIVES Develop and refine a basic dataset to enable standardized documentation of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) interventions delivered in a controlled clinical trial intended to improve voluntary motor function. SETTING International Expert Working Group. METHODS An international working group with expertise in spinal cord injury, PT, OT, and measurement developed a draft of the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Physical Therapy-Occupational Therapy (PT-OT) Basic Data Set (BDS). Emphasis was placed on efficiency and practicality of use. The BDS was iteratively refined based on applicable literature, and feedback collected from presentations at the 2017 and 2019 International Spinal Cord Society meetings. RESULTS The ISCI PT-OT BDS contains seven broad categories of interventions: bed/seated mobility, standing activities, walking/stairs, gross motor upper extremity, fine motor upper extremity, strength training, and endurance training. The first five categories are classified as activity-directed and the last two as impairment-directed interventions. Time spent on interventions per category is recorded in 15-min intervals. CONCLUSIONS The ISCI PT-OT BDS enables standardized documentation of PT-OT activity-directed or impairment-directed interventions. The ISCI PT-OT BDS is a documentation tool to facilitate evaluation of the influence of rehabilitation therapies on motor function in clinical trials of biologic or pharmacologic agents or rehabilitation technologies that are delivered in the clinical setting.","output":"International Spinal Cord Injury Physical Therapy-Occupational Therapy Basic Data Set (Version 1.2)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the charge transfer complex on the dielectric relaxation processes in free poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer sheets was investigated.

Individuals with chronic conditions, including patients with kidney failure and/or kidney transplants, are affected more substantially due to multiple comorbidities and altered immune system. The first step of this infection process is the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, followed by its priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). We hypothesized that the expressions of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 are increased in microvasculature, in addition to increased circulating soluble ACE-2 levels in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD); i.e. prerequisites to explain to why ESKD patients are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we assessed if there is a difference in the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in the resistance artery and subcutaneous adipose tissue, alongside circulating soluble ACE-2 levels in ESKD patients versus controls. METHOD: A total of 210 participants were enrolled, representing 80 ESKD and 73 healthy controls for soluble ACE-2 analysis, and 31 ESKD and 26 healthy controls for isolated subcutaneous vasculature bioassay. Immunofluorescence techniques were performed for the detection and evaluation of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in isolated subcutaneous resistance artery (200-300 m of internal aCE) and adipose tissue. Soluble ACE-2 protein concentration was detected using commercially available ELISA kits. RESULTS: Soluble ACE-2 levels were significantly higher in ESKD (3.8 ng/mL, IQR 2.4-5.5, n=80) vs control groups (2.7 ng/mL, IQR 2.1-3.7 ng/mL, n=73). There was no difference in soluble ACE-2 between females and males in either group. Soluble ACE-2 was positively correlated with IL-6 (rho=0.257, p=0.02, n=80), while it was negatively correlated with cholesterol (rho= -0.248, p=0.02, n=78) in ESKD patients. The expression of ACE-2 receptor was observed both on endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in arteries from both groups. The expression was higher in ESKD patients (19.1%, n=23) vs controls (15.4%, n=15). Patients with ESKD on ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment showed higher expression of ACE-2 vs. non-treatment group (treatment: 20.2%, n=12 vs non-treatment: 12.8%, n=11) in resistance artery. In subcutaneous adipose tissue the ACE-2 staining was not statistically different among the groups (ESKD: 2.9%, n=10 vs controls: 3.6%, n=10). In addition, TMPRSS2 was expressed both on endothelium and VSMCs in resistance artery, however there was no difference in the expression (ESKD: 8.4%, n=23 vs controls: 10.2%, n=15) between the groups. CONCLUSION: Soluble ACE-2 levels and ACE-2 receptor expression in the vasculature were higher in patients with ESKD as compared to controls. The ACE-2 receptor is present both in the endothelium and VSMCs from arteries in peripheral microcirculation. This supports the suggestion that the uremic milieu induces an optimal environment for SARS-CoV-2 entrance in microcirculation with following consequence on the vasculature during the COVID-19. Similarly, TMPRSS2 expression was observed in vessels from both groups, while increased expression of ACE-2 receptor was observed in those ESKD patients receiving ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment. Further studies are warranted to assess possible sex differences in the target receptor expressions with further elaboration on specific treatment regime(s) for different comorbidities present in patients with ESKD.","output":"MO069 SARS-COV-2 RECEPTOR ACE-2, TMPRSS2 AND SOLUBLE ACE-2 IN PATIENTS WITH END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Existing data suggest that American adults experience added emotional difficulties amid the coronavirus disease outbreak. Psychotherapy can help mitigate mental health concerns;still, many individuals with unmet mental health needs refrain from professional help-seeking. According to theory of reasoned action, negative help-seeking attitudes are key barriers to engagement with mental health services. Given that individuals with severe distress are more likely to seek therapy than individuals with mild psychopathology symptoms, greater initial and increasing levels of internalizing symptoms amid the coronavirus outbreak likely are linked to increasingly favorable attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Method: In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, American community adults, N = 831 [49.0% Asian Americans], Mage = 46.78, 50.2% women, were recruited for a panel survey study conducted over the course of three weeks. At each time point, participants completed questionnaires to assess their internalizing symptoms associated with depression and anxiety as well as their openness to and perceived value/need in treatment seeking. Results: Very few participants-especially Asian Americans -were seeking counseling during the study period. Latent growth curve results showed a general decline in internalizing symptoms, and no changes in openness to and perceived need in professional help-seeking. Whereas there were no time-varying correlations between internalizing symptoms and help-seeking attitudes, individuals with greater baseline internalizing symptoms generally were more open to seeking professional help and perceived less value in mental health services. Sensitivity analyses showed patterns in the Asian American subsample similar to those in the overall sample.

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols and surfaces has highlighted the need for efficient indoor disinfection methods. For instance, the use of ozone gas as a safe and potent disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2 virus is of particular interest. Here we tested the use of pseudoviruses as a model for evaluating ozone disinfection of the coronavirus at ozone concentrations of 30, 100, and 1000 ppmv. Results show that ozone disinfection rate of pseudoviruses was similar to that of coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) at short contact times, below 30 min. Viral infection decreased by 95% following ozone exposure for 20 min at 1000 ppmv, 30 min at 100 ppmv and about 40 min at 30 ppmv. This findings mean that ozone is a powerful disinfectant toward the enveloped pseudovirus even at low ozone exposure. We also showed that viral disinfection occurs on various contaminated surfaces, with a positive association between disinfection and surface hydrophilicity. Infected surfaces made of aluminum alloy, for example, were better disinfected with ozone as compared to brass, copper, and nickel surfaces.

METHOD An online anonymous survey was designed to investigate family demographic characteristics, COVID-19 outbreak and restriction-related variables, children/adolescents' behavioral regulation problems, parental stress, and resilience. Data were collected from 1,472 parents (83.1% mothers) of 1632 NDD children/adolescents (33.7% females). RESULTS Compared to pre-emergency, parents reported a significant increase in their children's behavioral regulation problems: Anxious/depressed behavior, Attention problems, and Aggressive behavior (p < .001), and they reported feeling more Overwhelmed and Burdened (p < .001) as parents but less Unfulfilled, Numbness, Devastated, and Angry (p < .001).

CONCLUSIONS Results showed that behavioral regulation problems in children/adolescents with NDD and parental stress increased. However, parental resilience can act as a protective factor, counterbalancing parental difficulties in the care of their NDD children during the emergency.

Among those health impacts, infectious diseases still represent a significant public health problem in China. However, there have been few studies on the identification of the spectrum of infectious diseases associated with floods in one area. This study aimed to quantitatively identify sensitive infectious diseases associated with floods in Guangxi, China. METHODS: A time-trend ecological design was conducted. A descriptive analysis was first performed to exclude infectious diseases with low incidence from 2005 to 2012 in ten study sites of Guangxi. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to examine the difference in the ten-day attack rate of infectious diseases between the exposure and control periods with different lagged effects. Negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to examine the relationship and odd ratios (ORs) of the risk of floods on infectious diseases of preliminary screening. RESULTS: A total of 417,271 infectious diseases were notified. There were 11 infectious diseases associated with floods in the preliminary screening process for flood-sensitive infectious diseases. The strongest effect was shown with a 0C9 ten-day lag in different infectious diseases. Multivariate analysis showed that floods were significantly associated with an increased the risk of bacillary dysentery (odds ratio (OR) = 1.268, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072C1.500), acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC, OR = 3.230, 95% CI: 1.976C5.280), influenza A (H(1)N(1)) (OR = 1.808, 95% CI: 1.721C1.901), tuberculosis (OR = 1.200, 95% CI: 1.036C1.391), influenza (OR = 2.614, 95% CI: 1.476C4.629), Japanese encephalitis (OR = 2.334, 95% CI: 1.119C4.865), and leptospirosis (OR = 1.138, 95% CI: 1.075C1.205), respectively.

METHODS Dixon images were acquired of 14 subjects and segmented in dielectric models with an eight-channel local transmit array positioned around the torso for cardiac imaging. EM simulations were done to calculate SAR distributions. Based on the SAR distributions, temperature simulations were performed for exposure times of 6 min and 30 min. Peak local SAR and temperature rise levels were calculated for different RF shim settings. A statistical analysis of the resulting peak local SAR and temperature rise levels was performed to arrive at safe power limits. RESULTS For RF shim vectors with random phase and uniformly distributed power, a safe average power limit of 35.7 W was determined (first level controlled mode). When RF amplitude and phase shimming was performed on the heart, a safe average power limit of 35.0 W was found. According to Pennes' model, our numerical study suggests a very low probability of exceeding the absolute local temperature limit of 40 C for a total exposure time of 6 min and a peak local SAR of 20 W/kg. For a 30 min exposure time at 20 W/kg, it was shown that the absolute temperature limit can be exceeded in the case where perfusion does not change with temperature.

The plan was finalized in May 2020. The plan triages patients based on exclusion criteria (imminent mortality), prognosis and expected benefit of ventilation (using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), and change in prognosis over time. Decisions are made by committee in order to minimize moral distress among individual patient care providers.Due to international concerns about healthcare resource shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals need allocation policies informed by the crisis standard of care, the hospitals ethical duty to plan for an emergency, and federal civil rights laws Policy Implications: This type of policy can serve as a model for other institutions to develop crisis standards of care resource allocation policies, which are a necessary component of disaster planning.

However, no study reported combination of high sensitive C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation), albumin and prealbumin (markers of nutritional status) in the prognosis of COVID-19 among Nigerian COVID-19 patients. We assessed plasma levels of hsCRP, albumin, prealbumin, hsCRPalbumin ratio and hsCRP-prealbumin ratio in newly admitted COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients at discharge. Material and Methods: Albumin, pre-albumin and C-RP levels were determined in the plasma of confirmed cases of COVID-19 recruited form one Infectious Diseases Center, Ibadan, Nigeria using ELISA. hsCRP-albumin ratio and hsCRP-prealbumin ratio were calculated. All these parameters were compared in both groups of patients and controls. Results: hsC-RP level was significantly higher in newly admitted COVID-19 patients compared with discharged COVID-19 patients or COVID-19 free control (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in plasma levels of albumin, prealbumin, hsCRP-albumin ratio and hsCRP-prealbumin ratio in both groups of COVID-19 patients compared with control (p>0.05). The mean values of plasma hsC-RP, albumin and prealbumin in most COVID-19 patients (89%, 100% and 91% respectively) were within normal reference ranges. hsC-RP were significantly increased in newly admitted COVID-19 patients who were females, above 40 years of age and stayed above 10 days of hospital admission (p<0.05 in each case).

Using a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, acute infection is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness as well as enhanced responses to subsequent sensitization to allergen. We demonstrate that acute viral infection results in increased airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine and pulmonary neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation. This response is associated with predominant production of Th-1-type cytokines in peribronchial lymph node cells in vitro. Mice sensitized to ovalbumin via the airways after RSV infection developed increased airway responsiveness to methacholine and pulmonary eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, associated with the predominant production of Th-2-type cytokines. Treatment of the mice with anti-IL-5 antibody abolished airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic but not neutrophilic inflammation in both acutely infected mice and mice sensitized after infection. We conclude that RSV infection results in airway hyperresponsiveness in the acute phase and leads to changes in immune function that can enhance the effects of airway sensitization to antigen after infection. In both situations, airway hyperresponsiveness is closely associated with pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation. This model provides a means for further analyzing the influence of viral respiratory infections on airway sensitization and the development of altered airway responsiveness.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection results in airway hyperresponsiveness and enhanced airway sensitization to allergen."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we developed a sensitive and efficient analytical approach combining a 96-well plate-based protein precipitation strategy with ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in order to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of sivelestat and its metabolite XW-IMP-A in samples of plasma from ALI/ARDS patients with SIRS.

This study aims to investigate the role of nations' economic development in the death toll associated with COVID-19 in Europe and Israel. Methods: Number of COVID-19 cases, deaths per million, and case fatality rate (CFR) in Israel and 39 countries in Europe were described across quintiles of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The association between GDP per capita and COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and CFR was investigated using generalized linear modeling adjusting for the proportion of elderly and density of the population. Results: In countries belonging to the three lower GDP quintiles, COVID-19 incidence rates per million (range 708-1134) were substantially lower compared to countries in the fourth (3939) and fifth (3476) quintiles. Major differences were also calculated in COVID-19 mortality rates per million (25-31 vs. 222-268). There was no significant (p=0.19) differences in CFR between GDP quintiles (range: 2.79-7.62%). Conclusions: COVID-19 had a greater toll in more developed nations. Though comparisons are limited by differences in testing, reporting and lockdown policies, this association likely reflects increased spread from trade and tourism in wealthier countries, whereas limited health system capacity and lack of treatment and vaccination options contributed to higher than expected CFR in wealthier countries. This unique situation will probably encourage the stronger economies to invest the required financial capacity to respond to and recover from the current crisis.","output":"COVID-19 DEATH TOLL: THE ROLE OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised some important interrogations on minimally invasive gynaecological surgery. The International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) has taken upon itself the task of providing guidance and best practice policies for all practicing gynaecological endoscopists. Factors affecting decision making processes in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) vary depending on factors such as the phase of the pandemic, policies on control and prevention, expertise and existing infrastructure. Our responsibility remains ensuring the safety of all health care providers, ancillary staff and patients during this unusual period. We reviewed the current literature related to gynecological and endoscopic surgery during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) crisis. Regarding elective surgery, universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out wherever possible 40 h prior to surgery. In case of confirmed positive case of SARS-CoV-2, surgery should be delayed. Priority should be given to relatively urgent cases such as malignancies. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for benign non-life-threatening surgeries. When possible, we recommend to perform cases by laparoscopy and to allow early discharges. Any procedure with risk of bowel involvement should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) in stool. Regarding urgent surgery, each unit should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Patients should be screened for symptoms and symptomatic patients must be tested. In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases. We recommend to avoid intubation and ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized. Patients who screen or test negative may have general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery while strict protocols of infection control are upheld. Surgery in screen-positive as well as SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that cannot be safely postponed should be undertaken with full PPE with ensuring that only essential personnel are exposed. If available, negative pressure theatres should be used for patients who are positive or screen high risk. During open and vaginal procedures, suction can be used to minimize droplet and bioaerosol spread. In a patient who screens low risk or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered. We recommend, during minimal access surgeries, to use strategies to reduce production of bioaerosols (such as minimal use of energy, experienced surgeon), to reduce leakage of smoke aerosols (for example, minimizing the number of ports used and size of incisions, as well as reducing the operating pressures) and to promote safe elimination of smoke during surgery and during the ports' closure (such as using gas filters and smoke evacuation systems). During the post-peak period of pandemic, debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. In conclusion, based on the existent evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international trends favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis, recognizing the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries.","output":"International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) guidelines and recommendations on gynecological endoscopy during the evolutionary phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biliary atresia (BA) is a devastating liver disease in neonates. Liver fibrosis is regarded as a universal and prominent feature of BA. Studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate cellular processes during the development of liver fibrosis in BA. Long non-coding RNA-adducin 3 antisense RNA1 (lnc-ADD3-AS1) has been shown to increase susceptibility to BA. However, the role of lnc-ADD3-AS1 in liver fibrosis in BA remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of lnc-ADD3-AS1 in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line, LX-2. We successfully overexpressed and silenced lnc-ADD3-AS1 in LX-2 cells using adenovirus vectors and evaluated the proliferation of transfected cells using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and flow cytometry. We then analyzed cell migration by performing wound-scratch and transwell migration assays. Our results show that lnc-ADD3-AS1 significantly promoted LX-2 cell proliferation and attenuated apoptosis. More importantly, lncRNA-ADD3-AS1 significantly accelerated the migration of LX-2 cells. Our data indicated that lncRNA-ADD3-AS1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in patients with BA and may serve as a potential diagnostic marker for monitoring liver fibrosis in BA or as a therapeutic target for the disease.","output":"Role of long non-coding RNA-adducin 3 antisense RNA1 in liver fibrosis of biliary atresia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quantitative study examined student participation in an introductory project-based engineering course offered in fully face-to-face and hybrid course modes (N = 160).

Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of Adipose Stromal Cell (ASC) concentrated secretome (CS), generated by process adaptable to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. We demonstrate that ASC-CS limits pulmonary histopathological changes, infiltration of inflammatory cells, protein leak, water accumulation, and arterial oxygen saturation (spO2) reduction in murine model of lung infection with influenza A virus (IAV) when first administered six days post-infection. The ability to limit lung injury is sustained in ASC-CS preparations stored at ?80 C for three years. Priming of the ASC with inflammatory factors TNF and IFN enhances ASC-CS ability to suppress lung injury. IAV infection is associated with dramatic increases in programmed cell death ligand (PDL1) and angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) levels. ASC-CS application significantly reduces both PDL1 and Angpt2 levels. Neutralization of PDL1 with anti-mouse PDL1 antibody starting Day6 onward effectively ablates lung PDL1, but only non-significantly reduces Angpt2 release. Most importantly, late-phase PDL1 neutralization results in negligible suppression of protein leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that suppression of PDL1 does not play a critical role in ASC-CS therapeutic effects.","output":"Concentrated Secretome of Adipose Stromal Cells Limits Influenza A Virus-Induced Lung Injury in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on hospital ownership and supervision. Public hospitals are mostly, but not always, under the supervision of the Health Ministry. There are a certain number of other governing bodies that are directly involved in the management of hospitals. A cross-ministry group was set up in 2006 to facilitate the implementation of hospital reforms. Apart from the organizational structure, the funding of hospitals and its evolution is studied. Between 1979 and 1991, the government introduced a co-payment system in healthcare establishments. In 1992, the Ministry of Health officially granted greater autonomy to public hospitals. They were authorized to deliver paid services and to make profits, but were made responsible for their losses and debts. By 2003, central government funding had fallen to 8% of the hospital budget. As a result, public hospitals in China behave very similarly to for-profit firms, while being governed as any traditional public structure.

We assessed the role of these factors in affecting good stroke outcome in patients given alteplase. METHODS We did a pre-specified meta-analysis of individual patient data from 6756 patients in nine randomised trials comparing alteplase with placebo or open control. We included all completed randomised phase 3 trials of intravenous alteplase for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke for which data were available. Retrospective checks confirmed that no eligible trials had been omitted. We defined a good stroke outcome as no significant disability at 3-6 months, defined by a modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1. Additional outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (defined by type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days and, separately, by the SITS-MOST definition of parenchymal type 2 haemorrhage within 36 h), fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days, and 90-day mortality. FINDINGS Alteplase increased the odds of a good stroke outcome, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefit. Treatment within 30 h resulted in a good outcome for 259 (329%) of 787 patients who received alteplase versus 176 (231%) of 762 who received control (OR 175, 95% CI 135-227); delay of greater than 30 h, up to 45 h, resulted in good outcome for 485 (353%) of 1375 versus 432 (301%) of 1437 (OR 126, 95% CI 105-151); and delay of more than 45 h resulted in good outcome for 401 (326%) of 1229 versus 357 (306%) of 1166 (OR 115, 95% CI 095-140). Proportional treatment benefits were similar irrespective of age or stroke severity. Alteplase significantly increased the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage definition 231 [68%] of 3391 vs 44 [13%] of 3365, OR 555, 95% CI 401-770, p<00001; SITS-MOST definition 124 [37%] vs 19 [06%], OR 667, 95% CI 411-1084, p<00001) and of fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days (91 [27%] vs 13 [04%]; OR 714, 95% CI 398-1279, p<00001). The relative increase in fatal intracranial haemorrhage from alteplase was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk attributable to alteplase was bigger among patients who had more severe strokes. There was no excess in other early causes of death and no significant effect on later causes of death. Consequently, mortality at 90 days was 608 (179%) in the alteplase group versus 556 (165%) in the control group (hazard ratio 111, 95% CI 099-125, p=007). Taken together, therefore, despite an average absolute increased risk of early death from intracranial haemorrhage of about 2%, by 3-6 months this risk was offset by an average absolute increase in disability-free survival of about 10% for patients treated within 30 h and about 5% for patients treated after 30 h, up to 45 h. INTERPRETATION Irrespective of age or stroke severity, and despite an increased risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage during the first few days after treatment, alteplase significantly improves the overall odds of a good stroke outcome when delivered within 45 h of stroke onset, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefits.

Speculum use is a key barrier. AIM: To assess if offering non-speculum clinician-taken sampling and self-sampling increases uptake for lapsed attenders aged 50C64 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Pragmatic randomised control trial conducted at 10 general practices in East London, UK. METHOD: Participants were 784 women aged 50C64 years, last screened 6C15 years before randomisation. Intervention participants received a letter offering the choice of non-speculum clinician- or self-sampling. Control participants received usual care. The main outcome measure was uptake within 4 months. RESULTS: Screening uptake 4 months after randomisation was significantly higher in the intervention arm: 20.4% (n = 80/393) versus 4.9% in the control arm (n = 19/391, absolute difference 15.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0% to 20.0%, P<0.001). This was maintained at 12 months: intervention 30.5% (n = 120/393) versus control 13.6% (n = 53/391) (absolute difference 17.0%, 95% CI = 11.3% to 22.7%, P<0.001). Conventional screening attendance within 12 months was very similar for both intervention 12.7% (n = 50/393) and control 13.6% (n = 53/391) arms. Ethnic differences were seen in screening modality preference. More White women opted for self-sampling (50.7%, n = 38/75), whereas most Asian and Black women and those from other ethnic backgrounds opted for conventional screening. CONCLUSION: Offering non-speculum clinician-taken sampling and self-sampling substantially increases uptake in older lapsed attendee women. Non-speculum clinician sampling appeals to women who dislike the speculum but still prefer a clinician to take their sample. Providing a choice of screening modality may be important for optimising cervical screening uptake.","output":"Non-speculum sampling approaches for cervical screening in older women: randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired us, as medical students, to reflect upon the communication training we have received in medical school and the obstacles we have faced in the clinic due to COVID-19.

The development and validation of new testing supplies and equipment, including collection swabs, has helped to expand the availability and capability for various diagnostic, therapeutic, and protective medical devices in high demand during the COVID-19 emergency. Here, we report the initial validation of a new injection-molded anterior nasal swab, ClearTip?, that was experimentally validated in a laboratory setting as well as in independent clinical studies in comparison to gold standard flocked swabs. We have also developed an in vitro anterior nasal tissue model which offers a novel, efficient, and clinically relevant validation tool to replicate the clinical swabbing workflow with high fidelity, while being accessible, safe, reproducible, and time- and cost-effective. ClearTip? displayed greater inactivated virus release in the benchtop model, confirmed by its greater ability to report positive samples in a small clinical study in comparison to flocked swabs.

Mauritania's first case was confirmed in March 2020. METHODOLOGY: We provide an update of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mauritania as of December 2020, and describe the country's Health System Response. RESULTS: In total, 133,749 diagnostic tests were performed, 14,364 (10.7%) were positive (309 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Case fatality rate was 2.4%. The 20-39 year-olds (41%) and males (59.1%) were most commonly affected. Comorbidities among fatal cases included cardiovascular diseases (44.8%) and diabetes (37.1%). Clinical symptoms included fever (57%), cough (52%), running nose (47%) and headache (26%). After the first case, prevention measures were progressively tightened, and quarantine implemented for all suspected cases. Schools and universities were closed, and flights to Mauritania suspended. Restaurants and cafeterias were closed, and night curfews installed. Friday prayers were suspended nationwide, and movements between regions restricted. These measures helped to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave, which peaked in June 2020 with low rates. However, the number of daily cases reached high levels in December 2020, during the second wave (40.1% of all cases and 48.9% of deaths). During the first wave, there were 38 ICU beds nationwide, but the ICU's capacity increased in short time. CONCLUSIONS: Mauritania has passed through the first pandemic wave with relatively low case fatality rates, currently being at the end of the second wave. As the country's health system is very vulnerable, there is a need for strict public health measures during epidemics.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritania: epidemiology and health system response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government of Guinea's overall approach to population problems is direct intervention to achieve developmental objectives that will results in self-adjustment of demographic trends.

METHODS: Since March 2020, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance has collected cases of patients with rheumatic disease with COVID-19. We report details of pregnant women at the time of COVID-19 infection, including obstetric details separately ascertained from providers. RESULTS: We report on 39 patients, including 22 with obstetric detail available. The mean and median age was 33 years, range 24-45 years. Rheumatic disease diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (n = 9), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 9), psoriatic arthritis/other inflammatory arthritides (n = 8), and antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 6). Most had a term birth (16/22), with 3 preterm births, 1 termination, and 1 miscarriage; 1 woman had yet to deliver at the time of report. One-quarter (n = 10/39) of pregnant women were hospitalized following COVID-19 diagnosis. Two of 39 (5%) required supplemental oxygen (both hospitalized); no patients died. The majority did not receive specific medication treatment for their COVID-19 (n = 32/39, 82%), and 7 patients received some combination of antimalarials, colchicine, anti-interleukin 1?, azithromycin, glucocorticoids, and lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSION: Women with rheumatic diseases who were pregnant at the time of COVID-19 had favorable outcomes.

PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients attending the ED with a blood culture-proven infection between 2012 and 2017 were included. We collected the comorbidities from the CCI and the vital signs from the NEWS. MAIN OUTCOMES: Short-term mortality (30-day) and long-term mortality (1 year). We assessed the predictive performance by discrimination, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We included 1039 patients with a blood culture-proven infection. Mortality was 10.4% within 30 days and 27.8% within 1 year. On average patients had two comorbidities (ranging from 0 to 6). Highly prevalent comorbidities were malignancy (30.2%) and diabetes mellitus (20.5%). The predictive performance of the CCI was highest for 1-year mortality (AUC 0.696 (95%CI) (0.660 to 0.732)) and better compared with the NEWS (AUC (95% CI) 0.594 (0.555 to 0.632)).

Methods: We exploit quasi-experimental variation, prompted by three major changes in policy, to assess whether public use of face masks elicit risk-compensation by increasing the number of close contacts or decreasing attention to distancing and hygiene measured in daily nationally representative surveys (N = 106,880). Results: Number of close contacts: Face mask use prompted by the policy changes decrease the number of contacts in two of the three interventions. In the remaining intervention, it has no effect.

Uncertainty due to change to motorized bicycle or fear of falling can be perceived as stressors for cyclists. Stress activates different physiological signal cascades and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which leads to the release of the stress hormone cortisol and further effects such as the development of low-grade inflammation. Both canin the long termbe associated with negative health outcomes. The aim of the study SiFAr-Stress is to analyze inflammatory processes as well as the activity of stress systems before and after a cycling intervention for older adults. METHODS: In this study, community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older will be randomly assigned to either a cycling or a control intervention in a parallel-group design. Objective HPA axisCrelated measures (saliva cortisol and hair cortisol) will be assessed before, after, and 6C9 months after the cycling and control intervention (T0, T1, and T2). Furthermore, changes in cortisol reactivity in response to the cycling intervention will be investigated at the second and seventh training lessons. Furthermore, secondary outcomes (fear of falling, perceived stress, salivary alpha amylase, and C-reactive protein) will be assessed at T0, T1, and T2.

This study examined the effect of glucocorticoids (GCS) on the time of virus clearance and absorption of lung lesions in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Severe and critical COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 7 to February 10, 2020 were analyzed. The generalized linear model was utilized to assess the effects of GCS therapy on the times of nucleic acid test turning negative and improved pulmonary imaging, respectively. RESULTS Of 66 patients, 51 (77.3%) and 15 (22.7%) were severe and critical cases, respectively, and aged 62  11 years. A total of 58 patients (87.9%) tested negative, and 56 (84.8%) showed improved lung imaging. Age, thrombocytopenia, CD8 + T cell count, course of GCS therapy, and total dose were correlated with the time of nucleic acid test turning negative (p < 0.05), and sex was correlated with the time of initial pulmonary imaging improvement (p < 0.05). The time of nucleic acid test turning negative in individuals with GCS therapy course  10 days was shorter than that of the GCS therapy course > 10 days group (p=0.001). No statistical difference was found in the dose, course of GCS, and initial time of improved lung imaging. CONCLUSIONS Increasing the dose of GCS and prolonging the course of treatment do not shorten the time of nucleic acid test turning negative or improved absorption of pulmonary lesions. Thus, the rational use of GCS is particularly important.","output":"Effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the prognosis of patients with severe and critical COVID-19: a single-center retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During the era of COVID-19, an increase has surged in the number of cases of mucormycosis;the use of high doses of steroids, and states of immunosuppression such as diabetes are the main related risk factors.

METHODS A total of 63 laboratory confirmed patients treated in our hospital were selected as the COVID-19 group, including 28 severe patients and 35 non-severe patients. Another 50 healthy subjects undergoing physical examination simultaneously were selected as the healthy group. Here we performed a study on the laboratory characteristics and explored their efficacy for diagnosis of the disease. RESULTS Compared with healthy people, the abnormal indicators of patients with COVID-19 are low levels of lymphocytes (LYM), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT), total protein (TP), and albumin (ALB), and high levels of monocytes (MON), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The level of MON and CRP in severe patients were significantly increased compared with non-severe pneumonia patients, and indicators such as LYM and ALB were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of LYM, MON, RBC, HGB, PLT, TP, ALB, AST, GGT, and CRP was 97.7% and 91.7%, which was higher than the single item (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of combined detection of LYM, MON, ALB, and CRP to predict the severity of COVID-19 were 96.4% and 73.0%, which were higher than those of separate detections (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The index of LYM, MON, RBC, HGB, PLT, TP, ALB, AST, GGT, and CRP can be used for the diagnosis of new COVID-19, and the indicators of LYM, MON, ALB, and CRP may be predictors of severe pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the added benefit of Cyclosporine-A (CsA), to low-dose steroid treatment, in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Open-label, non-randomized pilot study of patients with confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2, hospitalized from April to May 2020 at a single center in Puebla, Mexico. Comparative treatment with steroids or CsA plus steroids. Pneumonia severity was assessed by clinical, laboratory, and lung tomography. The death rate was evaluated at 28 days. RESULTS: 209 adult patients were studied, 105 received CsA plus steroids (age 55.3 13.3; 69% men), and 104 steroids alone (age 54.06 13.8; 61% men). All patients received clarithromycin, enoxaparin, and methylprednisolone or prednisone up to 10 days. Patients death was associated with hypertension (RR=3.5) and diabetes (RR=2.3). Mortality was 22 and 35% for CsA and control groups (p=0.02), respectively, for all patients, and 24 and 48.5% for patients with moderate to severe disease (p=0.001). Higher cumulative clinical improvement was seen for the CsA group (Nelson Aalen curve, p=0.001, log-rank test) in moderate to severe patients. The Cox proportional hazard analysis showed the highest HR improvement value of 2.15 (1.39-3.34, 95%CI, p=0.0005) for CsA treatment in moderate to severe patients, and HR = 1.95 (1.35-2.83, 95%CI, p=0.0003) for all patients.

Here, we explore the diverse mechanisms of SARS-CoV-induced inflammation. We presume that SARS-CoV-2 likely contributes analogous inflammatory responses. Possible therapeutic mechanisms for reducing SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses comprise FcR inactivation. Currently, there is no specific remedy available against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, recognizing efficacious antiviral leads to combat the virus is crucially desired. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (Mpro also called 3CLpro), which plays an indispensable role in viral replication and transcription, is an interesting target for drug design. This review compiles the latest advances in biological and structural research, along with development of inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros. It is anticipated that inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros could be advanced into wide-spectrum antiviral drugs in case of COVID-19 and other CoV-related diseases. The crystal structural and docking results have shown that Ebselen, N3, TDZD-8 and &#945;-ketoamide (13b) inhibitors can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor 13b inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu3 lung cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the treatment with Ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 reduced the amounts of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, 20.3-, 10.19- and 8.4-fold compared to the treatment in the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, repurposing of already present drugs to treat COVID-19 serves as one of the competent and economic therapeutic strategies. Several anti-malarial, anti-HIV and anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned in Table 2 were found effective for the COVID-19 treatment. Further, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was found more potent than chloroquine (CQ) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Furthermore, convalescent plasma from patients who have recuperated from viral infections can be employed as a therapy without the appearance of severe adverse events. Hence, it might be valuable to examine the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.","output":"COVID-19: inflammatory responses, structure-based drug design and potential therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the implementation of measures to prevent perioperative COVID-19 in thoracic surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 allowing a continued surgical treatment of patients. METHODS: The implemented preventive measures in patient management of the thoracic surgery department of the Asklepios Lung Clinic Munich-Gauting, Germany were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative COVID-19 incidence before and after implementation of preventive measures was investigated. Patients admitted for thoracic surgical procedures between March and May 2020 were included in the study. Patient characteristics were analyzed. For the early detection of putative postoperative COVID-19 symptoms, typical post-discharge symptomatology of thoracic surgery patients was compared to non-surgical patients hospitalized for COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirty-five surgical procedures and fifty-seven surgical procedures were performed before and after implementation of the preventive measures, respectively. Three patients undergoing thoracic surgery before implementation of preventive measures developed a COVID-19 pneumonia post-discharge. After implementation of preventive measures, no postoperative COVID-19 cases were identified. Fever, dyspnea, dry cough and diarrhea were significantly more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to normally recovering thoracic surgery patients, while anosmia, phlegm, low energy levels, body ache and nausea were similarly frequent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the lessons learned during the first pandemic wave, we here provide a blueprint for successful easily implementable preventive measures minimizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission to thoracic surgery patients perioperatively. While symptoms of COVID-19 and the normal postoperative course of thoracic surgery patients substantially overlap, we found dyspnea, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly more prevalent in COVID-19 patients than in normally recovering thoracic surgery patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline data were collected prospectively on 740 consecutive patients (mean age 61.4 years, 56.8% males), referred for a stress echocardiogram (SE), who underwent ESE between July 2020 (immediate post lockdown) and January 2021 according to national safety guidelines, in addition to patients wearing masks during ESE. Retrospective analysis was performed on follow-up data for outcomes. Propensity score matching was used to compare workload achieved during ESE pre-COVID-19, in 768 consecutive patients who underwent ESE between May 2014 and May 2015. Of the 725 (97.9%) diagnostic tests obtained, 69 (9.3%) demonstrated significant inducible ischaemia (3 segments) with no serious adverse events. Of the 61 patients who underwent coronary angiography, 51 (83%) demonstrated flow-limiting coronary artery disease. During a mean follow-up period of 4.6 months, one first-cardiac event was recorded. Compliance with mask-wearing throughout ESE was seen in 98.7% of patients. Of the 17 healthcare professionals performing ESE, none contracted COVID-19 during this period. SE service performance increased to 96.8% of prepandemic levels (100%) from 26.6% at the start of July 2020 to the end of December 2020. Propensity-matched data showed no significant difference in exercise workload between patients undergoing ESE during and prepandemic.

There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate. Methods We use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality. Results The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive. Conclusion Massive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways.

In this context, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic analysis from oro- and naso-pharyngeal swabs used for diagnosis. Tryptic peptides obtained from five positive and five negative samples were analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS using a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. Data analysis was performed using PatternLab for Proteomics software. From all SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs we were able to detect peptides of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that encapsulates and protect the RNA genome. Additionally, we detected an average of 1100 human proteins from each sample. The most abundant proteins exclusively detected in positive swabs were Guanylate-binding protein 1, Tapasin and HLA class II histocompatibility antigen DR beta chain. The biological processes overrepresented in infected host cells were SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay, viral transcription and translational initiation.

The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS The new model was implemented in CARDIOSIM?, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances, inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing. We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM? presented in this work allows the simulation of the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance. This facility may have significant importance in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 when they require mechanical circulatory support devices.","output":"Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation timing: A new numerical model for programming and training in the clinical environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: After the global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), research has concentrated its efforts on several aspects of the epidemiological burden of pandemic. In this frame, the presented study follows a previous analysis of the temporal link between cases and deaths during the first epidemic wave (Phase 1) in Italy (March-June 2020). METHODS: We here analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the time span from March 2020 to June 2021. RESULTS: The elaboration of the curves of cases and deaths allows identifying the temporal shift between the positive testing and the fatal event, which corresponds to one week from W2 to W33, two weeks from W34 to W41, and three weeks from W42 to W67. Based on this finding, we calculate the Weekly Lethality Rate (WLR). The WLR was grossly overestimated (~13.5%) in Phase 1, while a mean value of 2.6% was observed in most of Phase 2 (starting from October 2020), with a drop to 1.4% in the last investigated weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings offer an interesting insight into the magnitude and time evolution of the lethality burden attributable to COVID-19 during the entire pandemic period in Italy. In particular, the analysis highlighted the impact of the effectiveness of public health and social measures, of changes in disease management, and of preventive strategies over time.

The virus has wreaked havoc throughout the world since its declaration as a worldwide pandemic and has affected an expanding number of nations in numerous countries around the world. Recently, a substantial amount of work has been done by doctors, scientists, and many others working on the frontlines to battle the effects of the spreading virus. The integration of artificial intelligence, specifically deep- and machine-learning applications, in the health sector has contributed substantially to the fight against COVID-19 by providing a modern innovative approach for detecting, diagnosing, treating, and preventing the virus. In this proposed work, we focus mainly on the role of the speech signal and/or image processing in detecting the presence of COVID-19. Three types of experiments have been conducted, utilizing speech-based, image-based, and speech and image-based models. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been utilized for the speech classification of the patients cough, voice, and breathing, obtaining an accuracy that exceeds 98%. Moreover, CNN models VGG16, VGG19, Densnet201, ResNet50, Inceptionv3, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception have been benchmarked for the classification of chest X-ray images. The VGG16 model outperforms all other CNN models, achieving an accuracy of 85.25% without fine-tuning and 89.64% after performing fine-tuning techniques. Furthermore, the speechCimage-based model has been evaluated using the same seven models, attaining an accuracy of 82.22% by the InceptionResNetV2 model. Accordingly, it is inessential for the combined speechCimage-based model to be employed for diagnosis purposes since the speech-based and image-based models have each shown higher terms of accuracy than the combined model.","output":"COVID-19 Detection Systems Using Deep-Learning Algorithms Based on Speech and Image Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer is the leading cause of sex-specific female cancer deaths in the United States. Detection at earlier stages contributes to decreasing the mortality rate. The mammogram is the Gold Standard for breast cancer screening with an estimated sensitivity of 86.9% and a specificity of 88.9%. However, these values are negatively affected by the breast density considered a risk factor for developing breast cancer. Herein, we validate the novel LED-based medical device Pink Luminous Breast (PLB) by comparison with the mammogram using a double blinded approach. The PLB works by emitting a LED red light with a harmless spectrum of 640C800 nanometers. This allows the observation of abnormalities represented by dark or shadow areas. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the PLB device as a screening tool for the early detection of breast abnormalities. Our results show that the PLB device has a high sensitivity (89.6%) and specificity (96.4%) for detecting breast abnormalities comparable to the adjusted mammogram values: 86.3 and 68.9%, respectively. The percentage of presence of breast density was 78.2% using PLB vs. 72.9% with the mammogram. Even with higher findings of breast density, the PLB is still capable of detecting 9.4% of calcifications compared to 6.2% in mammogram results and the reported findings for cysts, masses, or tumor-like abnormalities was higher using the PLB (6.5%) than the mammogram (5.6%). A 100% of the participants felt comfortable using the device without feeling pain or discomfort during the examination with 100% acceptability. The PLB positive validation shows its potential for routine breast screening at non-clinical settings. The PLB provides a rapid, non-invasive, portable, and easy-to-use tool for breast screening that can complement the home-based breast self-examination technique or the clinical breast examination. In addition, the PLB can be conveniently used for screening breasts with surgical implants. PLB provides an accessible and painless breast cancer screening tool. The PLB use is not intended to replace the mammogram for breast screening but rather to use it as an adjunct or complemental tool as part of more efficient earlier detection strategies contributing to decrease mortality rates.","output":"Evaluation of the Pink Luminous Breast LED-Based Technology Device as a Screening Tool for the Early Detection of Breast Abnormalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Widespread testing of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in shortages of collection devices and transport media. We evaluated the stability of flocked swabs inoculated with SARS-CoV-2-containing specimen incubated dry (i.e. without transport medium) at room temperature. METHODS: A pool of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen was used to inoculate flocked swabs. Five swabs were placed immediately into UTM following inoculation, and tested immediately (day 0). Fifteen of the swabs were placed into sterile 15 mL conical tubes and incubated at room temperature for one, two, or seven days. Following incubation, swabs were hydrated in separate vials of UTM and tested. This protocol was repeated for viral transport media (VTM) and saline. As a comparison, a series of swabs was prepared and tested in parallel, but stored in the corresponding liquid transport media (UTM, VTM, or saline) and incubated at room temperature. Testing was performed at 1, 2, and 7 days post inoculation in duplicate. All molecular testing was performed using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: All dry swabs tested at days 1, 2, and 7 provided results that were within two cycle thresholds (Cts) of the average Ct values for swabs hydrated in the same media and tested on day 0. There was no statistical difference in Ct values between swabs incubated in liquid media versus dry swabs incubated at room temperature prior to hydration in liquid media.

The idea in using these systems is early recognition of potential or actual clinical deterioration in pregnant or postpartum women, and escalation of care. Barriers to successful implementation and use of EWS, however, have been identified. If EWS are to be applied consistently, a greater understanding of the views and experiences of EWS from the perspectives of those using and applying EWS in maternity practice is needed. This protocol describes a qualitative evidence synthesis of maternity care providers' (midwives, obstetricians, and allied maternity care professionals) views and experiences of EWS use and application in practice. Methods: Studies will be included in the review if they report on maternity care providers use and application of EWS in any birth setting. Qualitative studies and studies of mixed methods design, where qualitative data can be extracted separately, will be included. To source relevant literature the electronic databases of MEDLINE, CINHAL, Web of Science Core Collection (incorporating Social Science Citation Index) and Maternity and Infant Care (MIDIRS), from date of inception, will be searched. The methodological quality of the included studies will be appraised using the 12-criteria of the assessment tool developed by the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre. Thematic synthesis will be used for synthesising the qualitative data from included studies. The confidence in the findings will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research.

This paper reviews production processes in different medical isotope facilities during which radioxenon is produced. Radioxenon activity concentrations and isotopic compositions are calculated for six large facilities. The results are compared with calculated signals from nuclear explosions. Further, the outcome is compared and found to be consistent with radioxenon measurements recently performed in and around three of these facilities. Some anomalies in measurements in which (131m)Xe was detected were found and a possible explanation is proposed.

Primary outcome was severe/critical disease, defined as admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days of diagnosis or during index hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 502,780 vaccinated and 599,974 unvaccinated persons, there were 2,332 (0.5%) breakthrough infections in the vaccinated group and 40,540 (6.8%) infections in the unvaccinated group over a follow up period of 69,083 person-days in each group. Among these groups, we identified 1,728 vaccinated persons with breakthrough infection (cases) and 1,728 propensity-score matched unvaccinated controls with infection. Among the former, 95 (5.5%) persons met the criteria for severe/critical disease, while 200 (11.6%) persons met the criteria among the latter group. Incidence rate for severe/critical disease per 1,000 person-days (95% CI) was 0.55 (0.45-0.68) among the former and 1.22 (1.07-1.41) among the latter group (P<0.0001).

This situation has been investigated within the theoretical frameworks of athletic identity and cognitive emotion regulation. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of our investigation were to: (a) validate the athletic identity measurement scale (AIMS) for use in Italian language; and (b) explore differences by gender, typology of sport (individual vs. team), and competitive level (elite vs. non-elite) in athletic identity and in cognitive emotion regulation during the Covid-19 lockdown period. METHODS: To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the AIMS have been tested in Study 1. Multivariate and univariate analyses were run to evaluate differences between different groups of athletes in Study 2. RESULTS: Results from Study 1 suggest a 3-factor higher order model of athletic identity. Results from Study 2 highlight that, during this lockdown period, elite athletes and team sports athletes show higher athletic identity. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies are different for gender and for competitive level. Finally, athletes with higher athletic identity tend to ruminate and catastrophize more.

While some viruses exit this compartment early, others must reach the degradative, acidic environment of the late endosome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is one such late penetrating virus. To identify host factors that are important for reovirus infection, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen that targets over 20,000 genes in fibroblasts derived from the embryos of C57/BL6 mice. We identified seven genes (WDR81, WDR91, RAB7, CCZ1, CTSL, GNPTAB, and SLC35A1) that were required for the induction of cell death by reovirus. Notably, CRISPR-mediated KO of WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81) rendered cells resistant to reovirus infection. Susceptibility to reovirus infection was restored by complementing KO cells with human WDR81. Although the absence of WDR81 did not affect viral attachment efficiency or uptake into the endosomal compartments for initial disassembly, it reduced viral gene expression and diminished infectious virus production. Consistent with the role of WDR81 in impacting the maturation of endosomes, WDR81-deficiency led to the accumulation of reovirus particles in dead-end compartments. Though WDR81 was dispensable for infection by VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), which exits the endosomal system at an early stage, it was required for VSV-EBO GP (VSV that expresses the Ebolavirus glycoprotein), which must reach the late endosome to initiate infection. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for WDR81 in promoting the replication of viruses that transit through late endosomes.","output":"A CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals a role for WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81) in the entry of late penetrating viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the biggest threats to the global healthcare system, creating an unprecedented condition worldwide.

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR+ yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections. We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities.

While waiting for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing results, an accurate evaluation of the symptoms and serologic features can help us make a first diagnostic hypothesis and quickly start correct treatment.

Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","output":"COVID-19 and Telepsychiatry: Development of Evidence-Based Guidance for Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the three the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surges in South Korea, there was a shortage of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, and as a result, there were cases of death while waiting for hospitalization. To minimize the risk of death and to allow those confirmed with COVID-19 to safely wait for hospitalization at home, the local government of Gyeonggi-do in South Korea developed a novel home management system (HMS). The HMS team, comprised of doctors and nurses, was organized to operate HMS. HMS provided a two-way channel for the taskforce and patients to monitor the severity of patient's condition and to provide healthcare counseling as needed. In addition, the HMS team cooperated with a triage/bed assignment team to expedite the response in case of an emergency, and managed a database of severity for real-time monitoring of patients. The HMS became operational for the first time in August 2020, initially managing only 181 patients; it currently manages a total of 3,707 patients. The HMS supplemented the government's COVID-19 confirmed case management framework by managing patients waiting at home for hospitalization due to lack of hospital and residential treatment center beds. HMS also could contribute a sense of psychological stability in patients and prevented the situation from worsening by efficient management of hospital beds and reduction of workloads on public healthcare centers. To stabilize and improve the management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, governments should organically develop self-treatment and HMS, and implement a decisive division of roles within the local governments.","output":"The Development and Operation of a Home Management System during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of the Local Government Gyeonggi-do in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody detection methods for viral infections have received broad attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there remains an ever-increasing need to quantitatively evaluate the immune response to develop vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Here, we report an analytical method for the rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in human serum by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). A recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein labeled with HiLyte Fluor 647 (F-RBD) was prepared and used for FPIA. When the anti-RBD antibody in human serum binds to F-RBD, the degree of polarization (P) increases by suppressing the rotational diffusion of F-RBD. The measurement procedure required only mixing a reagent containing F-RBD with serum sample and measuring the P value with a portable fluorescence polarization analyzer after 15 min incubation. We evaluated analytical performance of the developed FPIA system using 30 samples: 20 COVID-19 positive sera and 10 negative sera. The receiver operating characteristic curve drawn with the obtained results showed that this FPIA system had high accuracy for discriminating COVID-19 positive or negative serum (AUC = 0.965). The total measurement time was about 20 min, and the serum volume required for measurement was 0.25 L. Therefore, we successfully developed the FPIA system that enables rapid and easy quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

Individuals aged 18 years and over testing positive for COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2021 with READ Codes present for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis formed the study cases. RESULTS A total of 1,966 people with IA and 166 602 without tested positive for COVID-19. The incidence rate was 3.5% (1,966/56 914) in IA, vs 6% in the general population (166 602/2,760 442), (difference: 2.5%, 95% CI: 2.4% to 2.7%, p = <0.001). In an adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, IA was not associated with higher mortality (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.18-1.64, p= 0.286). Significant risk factors included shielding (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.40-1.64, p = <0.001), hospitalisation for previous infections (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.12-1.28, p = <0.001), hospitalisations one year pre-pandemic (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.25-1.44, p = <0.001) and glucocorticoid use (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.25, p = <0.001). CONCLUSIONS Individuals with IA had a lower incidence of COVID-19, probably due to shielding.

Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing ~200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the proteins druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding.

Yet, the pandemic policy development for rural contexts remains poorly defined.

Rural communities have nuanced risks related to their mobility and interaction patterns coupled with heightened population needs, socio-economic disadvantage, and access and health service infrastructure challenges. This requires specific risk assessment and communication which addresses the local context. Pandemic resilience relies on qualified and stable PHC teams using flexible responses and resources to enable streams of pandemic-related healthcare alongside ongoing primary healthcare. This depends on problem solving within limited resources and using networks and collaborations to enable healthcare for populations spread over large geographic catchments. PHC teams must secure systems for patient retrieval and managing equipment and resources including providing for situations where supply chains may fail and staff need rest. Response consists of rural PHC teams adopting new preventative clinics, screening and ambulatory models to protect health workers from exposure whilst maximizing population screening and continuity of healthcare for vulnerable groups. Innovative models that emerge during pandemics, including telehealth clinics, may bear specific evaluation for informing ongoing rural health system capabilities and patient access.

Despite its effectiveness, CRT is underused, in part owing to concerns of tolerability and the need for integrated multidisciplinary care. We investigated factors associated with and the impact of treatment discontinuation in patients with MIBC treated with CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the US Veterans Affairs national database, we identified patients with urothelial histology, MIBC (T2-4a/N0-3/M0) diagnosed between 2000 and 2018 and treated with definitive-intent CRT. The primary endpoint of discontinued radiation was evaluated in a multivariable logistic regression. Secondary endpoints of 30-day and 90-day mortality, overall mortality, and nonbladder cancer mortality were evaluated in multivariable models. RESULTS: Of 369 veterans with MIBC who underwent CRT, 30 patients (8.1%) did not complete radiation. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation included comorbidities or infections necessitating hospital admission (63.3%) and treatment intolerance or declining performance status (26.7%). In multivariable logistic regression, variables associated with radiation discontinuation were creatinine clearance  50 (odds ratio [OR], 3.93; 95% CI, 1.63-9.50; P = .002), incomplete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.15-8.63; P = .02), and nonpreferred chemotherapy (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.31-8.36; P = .01). In the cohort that discontinued radiation, 30-day mortality was 33.3% and 90-day mortality was 50.0%, with the majority of deaths attributed to nonbladder cancer causes. No patient or tumor variables were associated with either endpoint. In the cohort that completed radiation, 30-day mortality was 2.7% and 90-day mortality was 6.8%. In multivariable analysis, radiation discontinuation was associated with worse overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.48; 95% CI, 1.36-4.50; P = .003) and worse nonbladder cancer mortality (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.24-4.34; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: With a low rate of treatment discontinuation, CRT is an effective and feasible treatment option for the typically elderly and comorbid population of patients with MIBC.

The modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale, the 6-Minute Step test (6MST) and handgrip dynamometry were used for assessments. In addition, participants responded to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). Correlation coefficients and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied. Fifty-seven participants with moderate to very severe COPD on LTOT were included (71  8 years, FEV1: 40  17%predicted). Social participation was associated with dyspnoea (rs=-0.46, p < 0.01), exercise capacity (r = 0.32, p = 0.03) and muscle strength (r = 0.25, p = 0.05). Better participation was also associated with fewer depression symptoms (rs=-0.40, p < 0.01) and a better quality of life (r = 0.32, p = 0.01). Dyspnoea was an independent predictor of social participation (p < 0.01) on regression models. Restricted social participation is associated with increased dyspnoea, reduced muscle strength and exercise capacity. Better participation is associated with fewer depression symptoms and better quality of life in individuals with COPD on LTOT.","output":"Social Participation and Associated Factors in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease on Long-Term Oxygen Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a type of beta-CoV that develops acute pneumonia, which is an inflammatory condition. A cytokine storm has been recognized as one of the leading causes of death in patients with COVID-19. ALI and ARDS along with multiple organ failure have also been presented as the consequences of acute inflammation and cytokine storm. It has been previously confirmed that SARS-CoV, as another member of the beta-CoV family, activates NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently develops acute inflammation in a variety of ways through having complex interactions with the host immune system using structural and nonstructural proteins. Numerous studies conducted on Tranilast have further demonstrated that the given drug can act as an effective anti-chemotactic factor on controlling inflammation, and thus, it can possibly help the improvement of the acute form of COVID-19 by inhibiting some key inflammation-associated transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B and impeding NLRP3 inflammasome. Several studies have comparably revealed the direct effect of this drug on the prevention of inappropriate tissue's remodeling; inhibition of neutrophils, IL-5, and eosinophils; repression of inflammatory cell infiltration into inflammation site; restriction of factors involved in acute airway inflammation like IL-33; and suppression of cytokine IL-13, which increase mucosal secretions. Therefore, Tranilast may be considered as a potential treatment for patients with the acute form of COVID-19 along with other drugs.","output":"Tranilast: a potential anti-Inflammatory and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor drug for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review examines the beneficial effects of ultraviolet radiation on systemic autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes, where the epidemiological evidence for the vitamin D-independent effects of sunlight is most apparent. Ultraviolet radiation, in addition to its role in the synthesis of vitamin D, stimulates anti-inflammatory pathways, alters the composition of dendritic cells, T cells, and T regulatory cells, and induces nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase metabolic pathways, which may directly or indirectly mitigate disease progression and susceptibility. Recent work has also explored how the immune-modulating functions of ultraviolet radiation affect type II diabetes, cancer, and the current global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. These diseases are particularly important amidst global changes in lifestyle that result in unhealthy eating, increased sedentary habits, and alcohol and tobacco consumption. Compelling epidemiological data shows increased ultraviolet radiation associated with reduced rates of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and ultraviolet radiation exposure correlated with susceptibility and mortality rates of COVID-19. Thus, understanding the effects of ultraviolet radiation on both vitamin D-dependent and -independent pathway is necessary to understand how they influence the course of many human diseases.","output":"Benefits of safe sunlight exposure: vitamin D and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundConflicting evidence exists on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on preterm birth (PTB) and stillbirth rates. We aimed to evaluate changes in PTB and stillbirth rates before and during the pandemic period and assess the potential effect modification of socioeconomic status (SES). MethodsUsing the linked administrative health databases from Manitoba, Canada, we conducted a quasi-experimental study among all pregnant women, comparing 3.5 years pre-pandemic (1 October 2016 to 29 February 2020) to the first year of the pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021). We used interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average models to assess the quarterly rates of PTB (<37 weeks) and stillbirths. We calculated the predicted trends based on pre-pandemic period data. Finally, we evaluated the lower and higher SES (average annual household income) using subgroup analysis and interaction models. ResultsWe examined 70,931 pregnancies in Manitoba during the study period. Following the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions in March 2020, there were no statistically significant changes in the rates of both PTB (p=0.094) and stillbirths (p=0.958). However, over the pandemic, the PTB rate significantly decreased as a rebound effect by 0.63% per quarter(p=0.005); whereas the stillbirth rate did not change significantly (p=0.878) compared to pre-pandemic period. During the first quarter of 2021, the absolute differences in the observed and expected PTB and stillbirth percentages were 2.05% and 0.04%, respectively. We observed a statistically significant effect modification by SES for PTB rates (p=0.047). ConclusionWhile the onset of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions was not associated with significant effects on PTB and stillbirth rates, we observed a statistically significant rebound effect on PTB rates. The impact of COVID-19 on preterm birth was dependent on SES, with higher influence on families with lower SES. Further studies are needed to detect future trend changes during pandemic waves after 2021 and assess potential underlying mechanisms.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic impact on preterm birth and stillbirth rates associated with socioeconomic disparities: A quasi-experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The percentage of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) is very low (30C40%), and hospitals providing CRP are either insufficient or lacking, even in countries with advanced medical care;therefore, this study aims to investigate the barriers, as well as compare the differences between hospitals, with or without CRP.

RESULTS Number of patients with normal liver enzyme levels were 63 (41.5%), while with raised levels of any of the liver enzymes were 89 (58.5%), out of which 43 (48.31%) had liver injury which manifested as increased severity in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) requirement (p=0.0005). Significantly raised levels of liver enzymes and liver injury were observed with age (p<0.0001) and in males (p=0.004). Significantly decreased levels of albumin and total proteins and increased levels of total bilirubin (p<0.0001) were seen in patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels and liver injury as compared to patients with normal levels. Significant increase in the levels of alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transferase was seen on the 7th day, CRP and ferritin (p<0.0001) peaks were observed on 2nd and 3rd day respectively.

It is caused by measles virus (MeV) and can lead to serious illness, lifelong complications and even death. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is now available to study molecular epidemiology and identify MeV transmission pathways. In the present study, WGS of 23 MeV strains of genotype H1, collected in Mainland China between 2006 and 2018, were generated and compared to 31 WGSs from the public domain in order to analyze genomic characteristics, evolutionary rates and date of emergence of H1 genotype. The non-coding region between M and F protein genes (M/F NCR) was the most variable region throughout the genome. Whereas the nucleotide substitution rate of H1 WGS was around 0.7510-3 substitution per site per year, the M/F NCR had an evolutionary rate 3 times higher, with 2.4410-3 substitution per site per year. Phylogenetic analysis identified 3 distinct genetic groups. The Time of the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) of H1 genotype was estimated at approximately 1988, while the first genetic group appeared around 1995 followed by 2 other genetic groups in 1999-2002.

Although antiviral drugs against influenza virus have been developed, there is an urgent need to design new strategies to develop influenza virus inhibitors due to the increasing resistance of viruses towards currently available drugs. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of natural compounds against influenza virus strains: A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) and B/Lee/40. Papaverine (a non-narcotic alkaloid that has been used for the treatment of heart disease, impotency and psychosis) was found to be an effective inhibitor of multiple strains of influenza virus. Kinetic studies demonstrated that papaverine inhibited influenza virus infection at a late stage in the virus life cycle. An alteration in influenza virus morphology and viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) localization was observed as an effect of papaverine treatment. Papaverine is a well-known phosphodiesterase inhibitor and also modifies MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway by downregulating the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (Extracellular signal-related kinase). Thus, the modulation of host cell signaling pathways by papaverine may be associated with the nuclear retention of vRNPs and the reduction of influenza virus titers. Interestingly, papaverine also inhibited paramyxoviruses PIV5, HPIV3 and RSV infection. We propose that papaverine can be a potential candidate to be used as an antiviral agent against a broad range of influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses.Importance Influenza viruses are important human pathogens which are the causative agents of epidemics and pandemics. Despite the availability of an annual vaccine, a large number of cases occur every year globally. Here, we report that papaverine, a vasodilator, shows inhibitory action against various strains of influenza virus as well as the paramyxoviruses PIV5, HPIV3 and RSV. A significant effect of papaverine on the influenza virus morphology was observed. Papaverine treatment of influenza virus infected cells resulted in the inhibition of virus at a later time in the virus life cycle through the suppression of nuclear export of vRNP and also interfered with the host cellular cAMP and MEK/ERK cascade pathways.

Therefore, respiratory tract volumes were measured in lambs and tidal volumes were compared in preterm infants before and after intubation. DESIGN In seven preterm lambs, volumes of the airways (oropharynx, trachea, lungs) were assessed. In 10 preterm infants, delta pressures, tidal volumes and leak were measured during ventilation 2 min before (mask ventilation) and 2 min after intubation (endotracheal ventilation). Inflations coinciding with breaths were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES Amount of upper airway distention in lambs and differences in inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume before and after intubation. RESULTS In lambs, the combined trachea and oropharynx contributed to 14 (12-21) % (median (IQR), whereas the oropharynx contributed to 9 (7-10) % of the total tidal volume measured at the mouth. In preterm infants, inspiratory (11.1 (7.9-22.6) mL/kg vs 5.8 (3.9-9.6) mL/kg (p=0.01)) and expiratory (8.3 (6.8-15.4) mL/kg vs 4.9 (3.9-9.6) mL/kg (p=0.02)) tidal volumes were significantly larger during mask ventilation compared with endotracheal ventilation. Leak was 18.7 (3.3-28.7) % before versus 0 (0-2.3) % after intubation (p<0.0001). Delta pressure was 23.7 (20.8-25.6) cm H2O before versus 24.8 (20.8-26.0) cm H2O after intubation (p>0.05).

Some viruses induce apoptosis during late stages of the infection cycle, while others inhibit apoptosis to facilitate replication or maintain persistent infection.

Here, we characterize the product of a CIV gene (iridovirus serine/threonine kinase; istk) with signature sequences for S/T kinase and ATP binding. ISTK appears to belong to the superfamily, vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs). The istk gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris vectors. Purified ISTK (48 kDa) exhibited S/T kinase activity. Treatment with ISTK induced apoptosis in budworm cells. A 35-kDa cleavage product of ISTK retaining key signature sequences was identified during purification. Pichia-expressed 35-kDa polypeptide, designated iridoptin, induced apoptosis and inhibition of host protein synthesis in budworm and boll weevil cells. A mutation in the ATP-binding site eliminated both kinase and apoptosis activity of iridoptin, suggesting that kinase activity is essential for induction of apoptosis. Analysis with custom antibody confirmed that ISTK is a structural component of CIV particles.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression. A tumor is heterogeneous and composed of different cell types. CSCs are a subpopulation of tumor cells possessing abilities to self-renew and differentiate. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present repurposed drugs, and potential candidates, that can serve as anticancer medications intended to target resistant cancer cells, i.e. CSCs.

RESULTS: Drugs that act against CSCs include ones approved for treatment of diabetes (metformin & thiazolidinediones), parasitic diseases (chloroquine, niclosamide, mebendazole & pyrvinium), psychotic disorders (thioridazine, clomipramine & phenothiazines), alcoholism (disulfiram), lipid disorder (statins), inflammatory diseases (tranilast, auranofin, acetaminophen & celecoxib), antibiotics (azithromycin), and other disorders. Current research findings advocate the existence of beneficial effects by combining these repurposed drugs, and also through their complementary use with conventional cancer therapies. CONCLUSION: Repurposing FDA-approved medications towards cancer care, by targeting the resistant CSCs, will allow for a quicker, cheaper development and approval process. A larger drug library available to physicians will allow for increased efficacy during both first-line and recurrent cancer treatments.","output":"Targeting Cancer Stem Cells with Repurposed Drugs to Improve Current Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The policy induced decline of human mobility has been recognised as effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19, especially in the initial stage of the outbreak, although the relationship among mobility, policy implementation, and virus spread remains contentious. Coupling the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases with the Google mobility data in Australia, we present a state-level empirical study to: (1) inspect the temporal variation of the COVID-19 spread and the change of human mobility adherent to social restriction policies; (2) examine the extent to which different types of mobility are associated with the COVID-19 spread in eight Australian states/territories; and (3) analyse the time lag effect of mobility restriction on the COVID-19 spread. We find that social restriction policies implemented in the early stage of the pandemic controlled the COVID-19 spread effectively; the restriction of human mobility has a time lag effect on the growth rates of COVID-19, and the strength of the mobility-spread correlation increases up to seven days after policy implementation but decreases afterwards. The association between human mobility and COVID-19 spread varies across space and time and is subject to the types of mobility. Thus, it is important for government to consider the degree to which lockdown conditions can be eased by accounting for this dynamic mobility-spread relationship.","output":"Examining the Change of Human Mobility Adherent to Social Restriction Policies and Its Effect on COVID-19 Cases in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To manage the spread of coronavirus, health entities have urged the public to take preventative measures such as social distancing and handwashing. Yet, many appear reluctant to take these measures. Research is needed to understand factors underlying such reluctance, with the aim of developing targeted health interventions. We identify associating coronavirus with death as one such factor. 590 participants completed surveys in mid-March 2020, which included attitudes toward coronavirus, preventative behavioral intentions, and sociodemographic factors. Associating coronavirus with death negatively predicted intentions to perform preventative behaviors. Further, associating coronavirus with death was not evenly distributed throughout the sample and was related with a number of sociodemographic factors including age, race, and availability of sick leave. Following recommended preventative measures to slow the spread of coronavirus appears to relate to the degree to which people associate coronavirus with death. These findings can be used by public health researchers and practitioners to identify those for whom targeted health communication and interventions would be most beneficial, as well as to frame health messaging in ways that combat fatalism.","output":"Fatalism in the context of COVID-19: Perceiving coronavirus as a death sentence predicts reluctance to perform recommended preventative behaviors()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini fokus untuk mengetahui bagaimana strategi Katadata dalam menghadapi perubahan pola bisnis akibat melemahnya perekonomian Indonesia yang terdampak pandemi COVID-19.

Small-molecule antivirals can provide an important therapeutic treatment option that is subject to challenges caused by the virus variants. The viral main protease (M(pro)) is critical for the virus replication and thus is considered an attractive drug target for specific protease inhibitors. We performed the design and characterization of three reversible covalent hybrid inhibitors BBH-1, BBH-2 and NBH-2, whose structures were derived from those of hepatitis C protease inhibitors boceprevir and narlaprevir. A joint X-ray/neutron structure of the M(pro)/BBH-1 complex demonstrated that a Cys145 thiolate reaction with the inhibitors keto-warhead creates a negatively charged oxyanion, similar to that proposed for the M(pro)-catalyzed peptide bond hydrolysis. Protonation states of the ionizable residues in the M(pro) active site adapt to the inhibitor, which appears to be an intrinsic property of M(pro). Structural comparisons of the hybrid inhibitors with PF-07321332 revealed unconventional interactions of PF-07321332 with M(pro) which may explain its more favorable enthalpy of binding and consequently higher potency.

Multilevel urine pregnancy tests (MLPTs), which provide accurate results in one week, are a promising alternative, but their use has not been evaluated within telemedicine services. METHODS: From November 2017 to May 2018, 165 eligible and consenting pregnant people who contacted safe2choose-an organization providing telemedicine abortion services internationally-for medication abortion were enrolled in a pilot study and mailed a package containing medication abortion drugs, two MLPTs and instructions. Data on 118 participants who completed a web-based evaluation survey two weeks after the package was sent were analyzed to examine participant experiences and satisfaction with the service. RESULTS: Responding participants were from 11 countries, including Mexico, the Philippines and Singapore. Ninety-three percent used both MLPTs, and 91% of those who used both tests used them at the correct time intervals. Among the 95% of participants whose MLPT results indicated that their pregnancy hormone levels decreased from before to after medication abortion, 86% correctly interpreted the results to mean that they were no longer pregnant. Satisfaction was high, with all indicating that the supplied information was helpful; more than nine out of 10 noted that they would want to use the MLPTs again. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating MLPTs into telemedicine abortion services is feasible and associated with high client satisfaction.

In the United States, there has been a strong partisan divide between the Democratic and Republican party's narratives about the pandemic which resulted in polarization of individual behaviors and divergent policy adoption across regions. As shown in this case, as well as in most major social issues, strongly polarized narrative frameworks facilitate such narratives. To understand polarization and other social chasms, it is critical to dissect these diverging narratives. Here, taking the Democratic and Republican political social media posts about the pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate that a combination of computational methods can provide useful insights into the different contexts, framing, and characters and relationships that construct their narrative frameworks which individual posts source from. Leveraging a dataset of tweets from elite politicians in the U.S., we found that the Democrats' narrative tends to be more concerned with the pandemic as well as financial and social support, while the Republicans discuss more about other political entities such as China. We then perform an automatic framing analysis to characterize the ways in which they frame their narratives, where we found that the Democrats emphasize the government's role in responding to the pandemic, and the Republicans emphasize the roles of individuals and support for small businesses. Finally, we present a semantic role analysis that uncovers the important characters and relationships in their narratives as well as how they facilitate a membership categorization process.

Bismuth, similar to other metals, has antimicrobial properties. Xeroform? has been used for decades in burn and plastic surgery as a donor site dressing and as a covering for wounds or partial thickness burns. Despite this, the antimicrobial spectrum of Xeroform? remains largely unknown. We examined the in-vitro efficacy of Xeroform? against common burn pathogens using zone-of-inhibition methodology in a commercial research facility. METHODS/DESIGN Pure strains of 15 common burn pathogens including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, Acinetobacter baumennii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella, Beta hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella enterica ssp. Enterica were inoculated at a strength of 106-1010 CFU/ml onto appropriate agar plates. A sterile 1 in2 Xeroform? square was placed in the center of each plate, and the Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) was measured following 18-24h of incubation at 37C. A second bismuth pharmaceutical (bismuth subsalicylate, Pepto-Bismol?) was then tested using the same methodology against the same strains of MRSA, MSSA, E. coli, K. pneumonia and S. marcescens. Finally, 3% w/v bismuth tribromophenate in glycerol suspension was tested against 13 burn pathogens for antimicrobial activity independent of the Xeroform? dressing by measure of Zone of Inhibition. RESULTS/FINDINGS For Xeroform?, none of the fifteen pathogens had a measurable zone of inhibition on any plate. Bismuth subsalicylate showed a zone of inhibition for MSSA in 3 plates (mean of 47.2mm), in one of three plates for MRSA (13.8mm), and in one of three plates for S. marcesens (89.6mm). There was no zone of inhibition seen for K. pneumonia or E. coli. Bismuth tribromophenate, when not bound to Xeroform? showed activity against 12 of 13 pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS While bismuth subsalicylate, and bismuth tribromophenate unbound to Xeroform? demonstrate antimicrobial activity, it appears that Xeroform? dressings do not. The utility of Xeroform? in burn medicine may relate more to use as an impervious dressing than to antimicrobial effect. Donor sites are clean surgical wounds and clean partial thickness burns may have minimal colonization present. In such circumstances, an inactive and impervious dressing may be all that is necessary to promote wound healing.","output":"The antimicrobial spectrum of Xeroform?."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participating in the roundtable \\"Psychoanalyzing the Apocalypse\\" in the time of Covid was an intellectually intriguing endeavor We began by ruminating on a world devastated by illness and death Having to grieve not only people but homes, jobs, school, friends, the world as we knew it Could we go back to how it was or is this the new normal?

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Throat swabs were collected from children younger than 5 years who have been hospitalized for SARI and screened for WUPyV, KIPyV, HCoVs, HRSV and HPeV using Real time PCR. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was identified in 23 (11.16%) of 206 hospitalized children with SARI. The rate of virus detection was considerably greater in infants <12 months (78.2%) than in older children (21.8%). The most frequently detected viruses were HCoVs with 7.76% of positive cases followed by KIPyV (2%) and WUPyV (1.5%). No HPeV and HRSV were detected in this study.

However, there has hardly been any focus on precarity which is the term that encapsulates the instability in people's lives. That is, a negative outcome can overspread to other decisions and measures of well-being. Studying precarity necessitates a shift in focus - from the point of view of the decision-maker to the perspective of the decision subject. This centering of the subject is an important direction that unlocks the importance of parting with aggregate measures to examine the long-term effects of decision making. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a modeling framework that simulates the effects of compounded decision-making on precarity over time. Through our simulations, we are able to show the heterogeneity of precarity by the non-uniform ruinous aftereffects of negative decisions on different income classes of the underlying population and how policy interventions can help mitigate such effects.","output":"Precarity: Modeling the Long Term Effects of Compounded Decisions on Individual Instability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are segments of nucleic acid that play a role in prokaryotic defense and form the basis of a genome editing technology that allows permanent alteration of genetic material.

We performed a systematic review to evaluate endovascular treatment for ruptured blister-like aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search and subgroup analyses to compare deconstructive versus reconstructive techniques and flow diversion versus other reconstructive options. RESULTS Thirty-one studies with 265 procedures for ruptured blister-like aneurysms were included. Endovascular treatment was associated with a 72.8% (95% CI, 64.2%-81.5%) mid- to long-term occlusion rate and a 19.3% (95% CI, 13.6%-25.1%) retreatment rate. Mid- to long-term neurologic outcome was good in 76.2% (95% CI, 68.9%-8.4%) of patients. Two hundred forty procedures (90.6%) were reconstructive techniques (coiling, stent-assisted coiling, overlapped stent placement, flow diversion) and 25 treatments (9.4%) were deconstructive. Deconstructive techniques had higher rates of initial complete occlusion than reconstructive techniques (77.3% versus 33.0%, P = .0003) but a higher risk for perioperative stroke (29.1% versus 5.0%, P = .04). There was no difference in good mid- to long-term neurologic outcome between groups, with 76.2% for the reconstructive group versus 79.9% for the deconstructive group (P = .30).

With improvements in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, homology modeling is becoming a more and more powerful and reliable tool. The present paper discusses the features and roles of homology modeling in structure based drug design, and describes the CHIMERA and FAMS modeling systems as examples. For a sample application, homology modeling of non-structural proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is discussed. Many biological functions involve formation of protein-protein complexes; in which the protein molecules behave dynamically in the course of binding. Therefore, an understanding of protein-protein interaction will be very important for structure based drug design. To this end, normal mode analysis is useful. The present paper discusses the prediction of protein-protein interaction using normal mode analysis and examples of applications are given.","output":"Protein structure prediction in structure based drug design."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are presumed to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiation therapy at our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Chest CT images were proposed during radiation therapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System classification. Nasal swabs with RT-PCR assay were initially proposed in cases of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiation therapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, and 313 patients had both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-7.8; 26 of 480 patients). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before radiation therapy for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases in which the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible, out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisitions. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated at 0.82 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), respectively. Adaptation of the radiation therapy treatment was made for all patients, with 7 postponed treatments (median: 5 days; interquartile range, 1.5-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of systematic use of chest CT screening during CT simulation for patients undergoing radiation therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic seemed limited.","output":"Systematic Screening of COVID-19 Disease Based on Chest CT and RT-PCR for Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy in a Coronavirus French Hotspot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biodegradable polymer materials are increasingly used in the packaging industry due to their good properties and low environmental impact. Therefore, the work was performed on the injection molding of the bio-based composites of polylactide (PLA) and polyhydroxyalcanates (PHI) modified with two phases: reinforcing (walnut shell flour and cellulose) and coloring (beta carotene and anthocyanin). The produced materials were subjected to wide mechanical characteristicstensile, flexural, and fatigue tests. Additionally, the influence of photo and hydrodegradation on the change of the surface structure and mechanical properties of the composites was assessed. The addition of natural fillers contributed to the improvement of the stiffness of the tested composites. PHI composites withstood a higher number of cycles during cyclic loading, but the stress values obtained in the static tensile test were higher for PLA composites. Moreover, a clear change of color was observed after both the photo and hydrodegradation process for all tested materials; however, after the degradation processes, the filler-modified materials underwent greater discoloration. For the composites based on PHI, the type of degradation did not affect the mechanical properties. On the other hand, for PLA composites, hydrolytic degradation contributed to a higher decrease in propertiesthe decrease in tensile strength for unmodified PLA after photodegradation was 4%, while after hydrodegradation it was 24%.","output":"Analysis of the Effect of Photo and Hydrodegradation on the Surface Morphology and Mechanical Properties of Composites Based on PLA and PHI Modified with Natural Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence has shown inequities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cases and deaths in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To explore the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago during the first 6 months of the pandemic. DESIGN: Ecological, observational study at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to September 2020. SETTING: Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. PARTICIPANTS: All populated ZCTAs in the 3 cities. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality cumulatively through the end of September 2020. Predictors were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and its 4 domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. The spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 outcomes was examined by using global and local Moran I statistics, and estimated associations were examined by using spatial conditional autoregressive negative binomial models. RESULTS: Spatial clusters of high and low positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality were found, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability in the 3 cities. Evidence was also found for spatial inequities in testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates and higher positivity ratios, confirmed case rates, and mortality rates.

However, the studies about the combined effects of total sleep duration and midday napping on cognition in elders were limited and inconclusive. We aimed to investigate the associations between total sleep duration, midday napping and cognitive function among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Methods Based on the 3rd wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2015, a total of 9218 participants aged 45 years with completed cognition measurements were included. Cognitive functions were assessed by a combined global cognition score of episodic memory and mental status. Information about sleep-related variables, demographic characteristics, and health status were collected by validated questionnaires. Multivariate linear regression models were performed to evaluate the associations between total sleep duration, midday napping, and cognitive function. Stratified analyses were used to explore the potential effect modifier. Results Overall, the global cognition score was 10.38  4.30 among the participants (mean age: 61.5  8.7 years). For sleep duration, both short sleep and long sleep duration were significantly associated with the increased risk of cognitive impairment after controlling for demographics and other confounders. Compared with sleeping for 7h per day, the adjusted -coefficient and 95% CI of the risk of cognitive impairment was -0.967 (95% CIs: -1.191, -0.742) for 5h, -0.257 (-0.498, -0.016) for 6h, -0.424 (-0.650, -0.198) for 8h and -0.664 (-0.876, -0.452) for 9h. The combined effect analysis indicated that subjects with extended or without naps had a significantly higher risk of cognitive impairment in the 5h sleep time group (ref: 7h) and in extended nappers or without naps group (ref: short nappers). Subjects with extended naps or without naps might increase the risk of cognitive impairment, especially those having 5h total sleep time. Stratified analysis showed that participants aged 60 years without social activity increased the risk of cognitive decline. Conclusion An inverted U-shaped association was observed between total sleep duration and cognitive function in Chinese elders, especially in those aged 60 years or without social activity. Short midday naps could mitigate the deleterious effects of poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration on cognitive function.

This studys central focus was to examine factors associated with t anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents in Ghana. (2) Methods: Analysis was performed using the 2012 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS). A sample of 1342 in-school adolescents was included in the analysis. The outcome variable was anxiety-induced sleep disturbance reported during the past 12 months. Frequencies, percentages, chi-square, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results from the multivariable logistic regression analysis were presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and with a statistical significance declared at p < 0.05. (3) Results: Adolescents who went hungry were more likely to report anxiety-induced sleep disturbance compared to their counterparts who did not report hunger (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.10, 2.57). The odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance were higher among adolescents who felt lonely compared to those that never felt lonely (aOR = 2.82, CI = 1.98, 4.01).

METHODS: VTM was prepared using different methods of sterilization then 'spiked' with virus. The VTM was investigated using viral culture in Vero cells, and for nucleic acid detection by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The best results were obtained by filter and autoclave-based sterilization. The VTM proved robust for culture-based analyses provided the inoculated VTM was stored at 4 C, and tested within 48 h. The filtered VTM also supported PCR-based diagnosis for at least 5 days when the mock inoculated VTM was held at room temperature. DISCUSSION: The manual handling of VTM production, including filling and sterilization, was optimized. SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into VTM to assess different sterilization methods and measure the effects of storage time and temperature upon VTM performance. While most diagnostic protocols will not require replication competent virus, the use of high quality VTM will allow for the next phase of laboratory analysis in the COVID-19 pandemic, including drug and antibody susceptibility analysis of re-isolated SARS-CoV-2, and for the testing of vaccine escape mutants.","output":"Optimal preparation of SARS-CoV-2 viral transport medium for culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses exist wherever there is life.

In the proposed integrated model, the SVM model classifies the data sample from listed companies, and the Logistic model is used for regression analysis on the credit risk assessment. Based on the credit risk indexes and weight uncertain factors of sample companies, FMCDM based on fuzzy set is applied to obtain the evaluation indexes. Then, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to obtain the weight of key indexes. Finally, the fit analysis is carried out according to the existing risk status of the sample company and the risk status results of the proposed integrated model. The results show that the integrated SVM-Logistic model is complementary and has high intensive evaluation. According to the fitness value obtained by FMCDM, the company's credit risk status can be accurately evaluated, and the intermediate threshold of corporate credit default risk measurement is 0.56152;if Fit is lower than the threshold, the companys credit is low, and if Fit is higher than the threshold, the companys credit is high.

At this moment, it is not possible to predict how many people will have consequences due to COVID-19 pneumonia, and therefore we believe that careful follow-up should be mandatory.","output":"A Dangerous Consequence of the Recent Pandemic: Early Lung Fibrosis Following COVID-19 Pneumonia C Case Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between prior metabolic surgery and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System in the United States. METHODS: Among 4365 patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 8, 2020 and July 22, 2020 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System, 33 patients were identified who had a prior history of metabolic surgery. The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n = 330) with a body mass index (BMI) &#8805; 40 kg/m2 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The average BMI of the surgical group was 49.1  8.8 kg/m2 before metabolic surgery and was down to 37.2  7.1 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared with the control group's BMI of 46.7  6.4 kg/m2. In the univariate analysis, 6 (18.2%) patients in the metabolic surgery group and 139 (42.1%) patients in the control group were admitted to the hospital (P = .013). In the multivariate analysis, a prior history of metabolic surgery was associated with a lower hospital admission rate compared with control patients with obesity (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.88; P = .028). While none of the 4 exploratory outcomes occurred in the metabolic surgery group, 43 (13.0%) patients in the control group required ICU admission (P = .021), 22 (6.7%) required mechanical ventilation, 5 (1.5%) required dialysis, and 8 (2.4%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Prior metabolic surgery with subsequent weight loss and improvement of metabolic abnormalities was associated with lower rates of hospital and ICU admission in patients with obesity who became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies.","output":"Association of prior metabolic and bariatric surgery with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in nationwide social distancing and shelter-in-place orders meant to curb transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The effect of the pandemic on injury patterns has not been well described in the USA. The study objective is to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the distribution and determinants of traumatic injuries. METHODS: This retrospective multi-institutional cohort study included all hospital admissions for acute traumatic injury at six community level I trauma centers. Descriptive statistics were used to compare injury causes, diagnoses and procedures over two similar time periods: prepandemic (March 11CJune 30, 2019) and pandemic (March 11CJune 30, 2020). RESULTS: There were 7308 trauma patients included: 3862 (53%) prepandemic and 3446 (47%) during the pandemic. Cause of injury significantly differed by period (p<0.001). During the pandemic, there were decreases in motor vehicle crashes (from 17.0% to 14.0%, p<0.001), worksite injuries (from 5.2% to 4.1%, p=0.02), pedestrian injuries (from 3.0% to 2.2%, p=0.02) and recreational injuries (from 3.0% to 1.7%, p<0.001), while there were significant increases in assaults (6.9% to 8.5%, p=0.01), bicycle crashes (2.8% to 4.2%, p=0.001) and off-road vehicle injuries (1.8% to 3.0%, p<0.001). There was no change by study period in falls, motorcycle injuries, crush/strikes, firearm and self-inflicted injuries, and injuries associated with home-improvement projects. Injury diagnoses differed between time periods; during the pandemic, there were more injury diagnoses to the head (23.0% to 27.3%, p<0.001) and the knee/leg (11.7% to 14.9%, p<0.001). There were also increases in medical/surgical procedures (57.5% to 61.9%, p<0.001), administration of therapeutics/blood products (31.4% to 34.2%, p=0.01) and monitoring (11.0% to 12.9%, p=0.01).

Many of the drugs that are currently in (pre)clinical development are addressing late symptoms of the disease. This review focuses on potential pharmacologic intervention at an early stage of infection which could result in less-infected individuals and less cases with severe COVID-19 disease due to reduced virus entry into the cells. METHOD: We scanned the literature for evidence on drugs that target the virus entry machinery into host cells and consist mainly of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as other cellular molecules regulating ACE2 expression, such as ADAM-17 and calmodulin. RESULTS: Several drugs/drug classes have been identified. Most of them are already used clinically for other indications. They include recombinant soluble ACE2, indirect ACE2 modulators (angiotensin receptor blockers, calmodulin antagonists, selective oestrogen receptor modifiers), TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat mesylate, nafamostat mesylate, antiandrogens, inhaled corticosteroids) and ADAM-17 enhancers (5-fluorouracil).

Somryst&#8482;, the first PDT authorized by FDA for treating chronic insomnia, delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) via a mobile application. CBT-I is the guideline-recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but availability of CBT-I therapists is limited. Somryst addresses this need by providing asynchronous access to CBT-I treatment. As a contactless therapeutic medium, Somryst is also an ideal option when face-to-face therapy is not available or recommended for safety reasons (e.g., because of possible exposure to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus). Areas covered: PDTs are the first class of software-based medical devices FDA-cleared and available via mobile applications. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and technical features of Somryst, and describes safety and effectiveness data from the randomized trials on which FDA clearance was based. Expert opinion: Somryst demonstrates robust clinical efficacy with a favorable benefit-to-risk profile for treating adults with chronic insomnia. FDA clearance was based on data from 2 clinical trials of the first-generation web-based CBT-I platform Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi).

Here, we explore trends in words and phrases related to mental health through a collection of 1- , 2-, and 3-grams parsed from a data stream of roughly 10% of all English tweets since 2012. We examine temporal dynamics of mental health language, finding that the popularity of the phrase 'mental health' increased by nearly two orders of magnitude between 2012 and 2018. We observe that mentions of 'mental health' spike annually and reliably due to mental health awareness campaigns, as well as unpredictably in response to mass shootings, celebrities dying by suicide, and popular fictional stories portraying suicide. We find that the level of positivity of messages containing 'mental health', while stable through the growth period, has declined recently. Finally, we use the ratio of original tweets to retweets to quantify the fraction of appearances of mental health language due to social amplification. Since 2015, mentions of mental health have become increasingly due to retweets, suggesting that stigma associated with discussion of mental health on Twitter has diminished with time.","output":"Quantifying language changes surrounding mental health on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile e-wallet or digital e-wallet is one of the emerging Financial Technologies (FinTech) that has become extremely prevalent during the last few years.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to oral and maxillofacial pathologists in the United States and Canada. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice, and Likert response scale questions. Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed with SPSS software. RESULTS: Most pathologists, at the time of survey completion, were teaching synchronously, primarily with case-based learning and live lectures. During lockdown, 52.4% and 50.0% of those with trainees expected their residents to show up for clinic- and laboratory-related procedures respectively.

Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of genetic variants involved in the susceptibility and outcomes of this syndrome. We aimed to identify novel genes implicated in sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility. METHODS: We first performed a prioritization of candidate genes by integrating our own genomic data from a transcriptomic study in an animal model of ARDS and from the only published genome-wide association study of ARDS study in humans. Then, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from prioritized genes to conduct a case-control discovery association study in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 225) and population-based controls (n = 899). Finally, we validated our findings in an independent sample of 661 sepsis-induced ARDS cases and 234 at-risk controls. RESULTS: Three candidate genes were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmic-2 heavy chain-1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), and integrin alpha-1. Of those, a SNP from FLT1 gene (rs9513106) was associated with ARDS in the discovery study, with an odds ratio (OR) for the C allele of 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58C0.98 (p = 0.037). This result was replicated in an independent study (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62C0.98, p = 0.039), showing consistent direction of effects in a meta-analysis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65C0.92, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: We identified FLT1 as a novel ARDS susceptibility gene and demonstrated that integration of genomic data can be a valid procedure to identify novel susceptibility genes. These results contribute to previous firm associations and functional evidences implicating FLT1 gene in other complex traits that are mechanistically linked, through the key role of endothelium, to the pathophysiology of ARDS.

This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis will likely increase the burden on food systems, exacerbating this situation. Pacific Island leaders have been proactive in adopting a range of food policies and regulations to improve diets. This includes taxes and regulations on compositional standards for salt and sugar in foods or school food policies. Whilst there is increasing evidence for the effectiveness of such policies globally, there is a lack of local context-specific evidence about how to implement them effectively in the Pacific. Methods: Our 5-year collaborative research project will advance knowledge of how to scale up food policy interventions in the Pacific Islands. The overall aim of this implementation science research project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of policy interventions to reduce salt and sugar consumption in Fiji and Samoa, and to examine factors that will support sustained implementation. We will engage, as partners, government agencies and civil society in Fiji and Samoa, and support the design, implementation and monitoring of a range of evidence-informed interventions aiming to reduce salt and sugar consumption, in the context of on-going health and environmental challenges, such as COVID-19 and climate change. Specific objectives are to: (1) conduct a policy landscape analysis to understand the potential opportunities and challenges to strengthen policies for prevention of diet-related NCDs in Fiji and Samoa;(2) conduct repeat cross sectional surveys to measure dietary intake, food sources and diet-related biomarkers;(3) use Systems Thinking in Community Knowledge Exchange (STICKE) to strengthen implementation of policies to reduce salt and sugar consumption;(4) evaluate the impact, process and cost effectiveness of implementing these policies. Discussion: The project will provide new evidence to support policy making, as well as developing a low-cost, high-tech, sustainable, scalable system for monitoring food consumption, the food supply and health-related outcomes. Contributions to the literature  Poor diets are one of the main contributors to non-communicable diseases. There is increasing evidence to show that food policy interventions (fiscal or regulatory) are an effective way of improving diets, globally.  This project will produce local context-specific evidence for the impact and cost-effectiveness of food policy interventions to improve diets in the Pacific Islands (Fiji and Samoa). It will also produce new insights into what is feasible and which factors contribute most to effective implementation in different contexts. The findings will provide important insights into gaps in the implementation science literature on food policy implementation, particularly in Small Island Developing States. The project will also make an important contribution globally since the innovative methods of engaging policy makers and monitoring food and health developed through the project may be replicated elsewhere.","output":"Scaling-Up Food Policies in the Pacific Islands: Protocol for Policy Engagement and Mixed Methods Evaluation of Intervention Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has received great attention, and most notably, the enthusiasm for HCQ has been one of politicization rather than science.

Yet a divisive media response affected recruitment, funding, and subsequent enthusiasm for continuing scientific investigations. Of the more than 300 HCQ trials registered, fewer than 50% report having recruited any patients, and most trials might fail to achieve any useful portions of their intended sample size. Multiple observational studies and two large randomized trials have demonstrated HCQ does not offer efficacy against COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Prophylaxis studies and early treatment studies provided heterogeneous results and are plagued by low event rates and poor study outcome monitoring.

Based on the epidemic data in England from September 1 to October 31, 2020, considering the continuous decline in the antibody level of COVID-19 recovers, an improved SEIR infectious disease dynamics model that considers the reinfection of recovers due to the decline in antibody levels is established. The kinetic parameters of the SEIR model are obtained by fitting. On this basis, a SEIRV infectious disease dynamic model with vaccination is established to study the impact of different vaccination rates and vaccine failure rates on the development of the epidemic in England. We obtain the lower the vaccine failure rate, the fewer new cases. When the vaccination rate is fixed at 0.005 (equivalent to 250000 people vaccinated every day), the peak of the epidemic will decrease with the decrease of vaccine failure rate. The peak value when the failure rate is 0.001 is 81.4% lower than the peak value when the failure rate is 0.01, and the peak value when the failure rate is 0.01 is 89.5% lower than the peak value when the failure rate is 0.02. When the failure rate is less than 0.01, the peak time will advance with the decrease of failure rate; when the failure rate is greater than 0.01, the peak time will be delayed with the decrease of failure rate; when the failure rate is 0.01, the peak time is 528 days later than that when the failure rate is 0.001 and 295 days later than that when the failure rate is 0.05. On the 60th day of vaccination, the vaccine failure rate of 0.002 decreases the number of cases by 5.8% compared with the vaccine failure rate of 0.01; on the 70th day of vaccination, the vaccine failure rate of 0.002 reduces the number of cases by 9.1% compared with the vaccine failure rate of 0.01. Therefore, with the extension of time, the vaccine with low failure rate has a more obvious effect on reducing the number of cases than the vaccine with high failure rate. When the vaccine failure rate is fixed at 0.005, we study the impact of different vaccination rates on the spread of the epidemic in England, the result shows that the peak of epidemic situation decreases with the increase of vaccination rate, and the peak time advance with the increase of vaccination rate, when the vaccination rate is 0.025, the peak decreases by 74.8% and the peak time was 114 days earlier than that when the vaccination rate is 0.005.Therefore, the higher the vaccine efficiency and vaccination rate, the lower the peak of the epidemic.

This exploratory qualitative study aimed to examine connections between land-use change and macaque-human interactions and assess the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. We conducted ethnographic interviews and focus group discussions in Old Dhaka, Madaripur, and Chandpur, Bangladesh. Participants reported significant anthropogenic landscape transformations leading to increased human-macaque contact in the study areas. Participants also reported that all three sites underwent substantial landscape alteration from natural or agricultural land to a human-altered environment with roads, commercial, and residential buildings. Participants noted that the disappearance of forestland appeared to increase the macaque dependence on backyard fruit trees. Where rivers and ponds were filled to support local construction, macaques were also observed as becoming more dependent upon human water sources. These changed may help expanding the macaques' foraging areas, and they appear to be invading new areas where people are not culturally habituated to living with them. In response, many residents reported reacting aggressively toward the macaques, which they believed led to more bites and scratches. However, other respondents accepted the presence of macaques around their homes. Few participants considered macaques to be a source of disease transmission.

This tight cerebral vascular endothelium regulates selective diffusion and active transport of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics into and out of the brain parenchyma. In this study, glutathione targeted PEGylated (GSH-PEG) liposomes were designed to deliver amyloid-targeting antibody fragments across the BBB into the brain. Two different formulations of GSH-PEG liposomes based on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) were produced. Both formulations encapsulate 15kDa amyloid beta binding llama single domain antibody fragments (VHH-pa2H). To follow the biodistribution of VHH-pa2H rather than the liposome, the antibody fragment was labeled with the radioisotope indium-111. To prolong the shelf life of the construct beyond the limit of radioactive decay, an active-loading method was developed to efficiently radiolabel the antibody fragments after encapsulation into the liposomes, with radiolabeling efficiencies of up to 68% after purification. The radiolabeled liposomes were administered via a single intravenous bolus injection to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and their wildtype littermates. Both GSH-PEG DMPC and GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes significantly increased the standard uptake values (SUV) of VHH-pa2H in the blood of the animals compared to free VHH-pa2H. Encapsulation in GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes resulted in the highest increase in SUV in the brains of transgenic animals. Overall, these data provide evidence that GSH-PEG liposomes may be suitable for specific delivery of single domain antibody fragments over the BBB into the brain.","output":"Enhanced glutathione PEGylated liposomal brain delivery of an anti-amyloid single domain antibody fragment in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe on-scene times for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) transferred to hospital, the number of these that were extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) eligible and potential association between end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2 ) and survival so as to inform planned interventional studies.

Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, -helix (AH) can rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising one is in antiviral medicine. Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological knowledge into clinical applications.","output":"Model Membrane Platforms for Biomedicine: Case Study on Antiviral Drug Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous strain on healthcare systems worldwide.

Additionally, whether kidney outcomes have evolved during the course of the pandemic is unknown. METHODS: We used electronic records to identify COVID-19 patients with and without AKI admitted to 3 New York Hospitals between March 2 and August 25, 2020. Outcomes included AKI overall and according to admission week, AKI stage, the requirement for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality and recovery of kidney function. Logistic regression was utilized to assess associations of patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 4732 admissions 1386 (29.3%) patients had AKI. Among those with AKI, 717 (51.7%) had Stage 1, 132 (9.5%) Stage 2, 537 (38.7%) stage 3, and 237 (17.1%) required RRT initiation. In March 536/1648 (32.5%) of patients developed AKI compared with 15/87 (17.2%) in August (P<0.001 for monthly trend) whereas RRT initiation was required in 6.9% and 0% of admission, in March and August respectively. Mortality was higher with than without AKI (51.6% vs 8.6%) and was 71.9% in individuals requiring RRT. However, most patients with AKI who survived hospitalization (77%) recovered to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline creatinine. Among those surviving to discharge, 62% discontinued RRT.

Those findings suggest that declarative memory processes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) do not contribute to motor learning. Here, we revisit this issue, testing an individual (L. S. J.) with severe MTL damage on four motor learning tasks and comparing her performance to age-matched controls. Consistent with previous findings in amnesics, we observed that L. S. J. could improve motor performance despite having significantly impaired declarative memory. However, she tended to perform poorly relative to age-matched controls, with deficits apparently related to flexible action selection. Further supporting an action selection deficit, L. S. J. fully failed to learn a task that required the acquisition of arbitrary action-outcome associations. We thus propose a modest revision to the classic taxonomic model: Although MTL-dependent memory processes are not necessary for some motor learning to occur, they play a significant role in the acquisition, implementation, and retrieval of action selection strategies.

Using single cell RNA profiling (scRNAseq) to assess ACE2 and associated SARS-CoV-2 proteases in healthy living donors (LD) kidneys, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and in kidney injury during viral infection, ACE2 expression was primarily associated with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). ACE2 mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in DKD versus LD, however, ACE2 levels were not altered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.

Further, we investigated the relationships between parental stress and anxiety and depression relative to relationship quality and anger toward their children at the two aforementioned time points, including subgroups based on age, parental role, cultural background, relationship status, education level, number of children, employment status and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement points. Parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stress that parents experienced during the implementation of the distancing protocols declined when the protocols were phased out. The decrease of perceived parental stress was accompanied by a significant decrease in the symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-offs for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% at T2, respectively. The reduction in depression and anger toward their child(ren) from T1 to T2 was associated with a reduction of parental stress. Relationship quality and anger toward their child(ren) at T1 further predicted a change in the level of parental stress from T1 to T2. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the negative psychological impacts of the implementation of the distancing protocols on parents health and well-being. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated with parents and families facing a social crisis such as the ongoing pandemic may contribute to the design of relevant interventions to reduce parental distress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.","output":"Mechanisms of parental distress during and after the first COVID-19 lockdown phase: A two-wave longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Covid-19 pandemic caused a shutdown of healthcare systems in many countries. We explored the impact on hypertension care in the Excellence Center (EC) network of the European Society of Hypertension. METHODS We conducted a 17-question electronic survey among ECs. RESULTS Overall, 52 ECs from 20 European and three non-European countries participated, providing hypertension service for a median of 1500 hypertensive patients per center per year. Eighty-five percent of the ECs reported a shutdown lasting for 9 weeks (range 0-16). The number of patients treated per week decreased by 90%: from a median of 50 (range 10-400) before the pandemic to a median of 5.0 (range 0-150) during the pandemic (P < 0.0001). 60% of patients (range 0-100%) declared limited access to medical consultations. The majority of ECs (57%) could not provide 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, whereas a median of 63% (range 0-100%) of the patients were regularly performing home BP monitoring. In the majority (75%) of the ECs, hypertension service returned to normal after the first wave of the pandemic. In 66% of the ECs, the physicians received many questions regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. Stopping RAS-blocker therapy (in a few patients) either by patients or physicians was reported in 27 and 36.5% of the ECs. CONCLUSION Patient care in hypertension ECs was compromised during the Covid-19-related shutdown. These data highlight the necessity to develop new strategies for hypertension care including virtual clinics to maintain services during challenging times.","output":"The corona-virus disease 2019 pandemic compromised routine care for hypertension: a survey conducted among excellence centers of the European Society of Hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following the rapid emergence of neonatal microcephaly in Brazil during the 2015C2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic. In response, a national campaign sought to control Aedes mosquito populations and reduce ZIKV transmission. Achieving adherence to vector control or mosquito-bite reduction behaviours, including the use of topical mosquito repellents, is challenging. Coproduction of research at the community level is needed to understand and mitigate social determinants of lower engagement with Aedes preventive measures, particularly within disempowered groups. DESIGN: In 2017, the Zika Preparedness Latin America Network (ZikaPLAN) conducted a qualitative study to understand individual and community level experiences of ZIKV and other mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Presented here is a thematic analysis of 33 transcripts from community focus groups and semistructured interviews, applying the Health Belief Model (HBM) to elaborate knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of ZIKV and vector control strategies. PARTICIPANTS: 120 purposively sampled adults of approximate reproductive age (18C45); 103 women participated in focus groups and 17 men in semistructured interviews. SETTING: Two sociopolitically and epidemiologically distinct cities in Brazil: Jundia (57 km north of S?o Paolo) and Salvador (Bahia state capital). RESULTS: Four key and 12 major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) knowledge and cues to action; (2) attitudes and normative beliefs (perceived threat, barriers, benefits and self-efficacy); (3) behaviour change (household prevention and community participation); and (4) community preferences for novel repellent tools, vector control strategies and ZIKV messaging. CONCLUSIONS: Common barriers to repellent adherence were accessibility, appearance and effectiveness. A strong case is made for the transferability of the HBM to inform epidemic preparedness for mosquito-borne disease outbreaks at the community level. Nationally, a health campaign targeting men is recommended, in addition to local mobilisation of funding to strengthen surveillance, risk communication and community engagement.","output":"Vector control strategies in Brazil: a qualitative investigation into community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions following the 2015C2016 Zika virus epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed the behavioral outcomes of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing protocols and their influences on mental health.

Despite there being no known vaccines or medicines that prevent or cure COVID-19, many traditional, integrative, complementary and alternative medicines (TICAMs) have been touted as the solution, as well as researched as a potential remedy globally. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of global research trends at the intersection of TICAM and COVID-19. METHODS: SCOPUS, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PSYCINFO databases were searched on July 5, 2020, with results being exported on the same day. All publication types were included, however, articles were only deemed eligible if they made mention of one or more TICAMs for the potential prevention, treatment, and/or management of COVID-19 or a health issue indirectly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The following eligible article characteristics were extracted: title; author names, affiliations, and countries; DOI; publication language; publication type; publication year; journal (and whether it is TICAM-focused); 2019 impact factor, and TICAMs mentioned. RESULTS: A total of 296 eligible articles were published by 1373 unique authors at 977 affiliations across 56 countries. The most common countries associated with author affiliation included China, the United States, India and Italy. The vast majority of articles were published in English, followed by Chinese. Eligible articles were published across 157 journals, of which 33 were TICAM-focused; a total of 120 journals had a 2019 impact factor, which ranged from 0.17 to 60.392. A total of 327 TICAMs were mentioned across eligible articles, with the most common ones including: traditional Chinese medicine (n = 94), vitamin D (n = 67), melatonin (n = 16), phytochemicals (n = 12), and general herbal medicine (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides researchers and clinicians with a greater knowledge of the characteristics of articles that been published globally at the intersection of COVID-19 and TICAM to date.

To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye.

As part of a larger study, this article explored the experiences and views of representatives of hospices in the Western Cape province of South Africa on the provision of appropriate spiritual care, given local issues and constraints. METHODS: Two sets of focus group discussions, with 23 hospice participants, were conducted with 11 of the 12 Hospice Palliative Care Association registered hospices in the Western Cape, South Africa, to understand what spiritual care practices existed in their hospices against the backdrop of multifaceted diversities. The discussions were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two prominent themes emerged: the challenges of providing relevant spiritual care services in a religiously, culturally, linguistically and racially diverse setting, and the organisational context impacting such a spiritual care service. Participants agreed that spiritual care is an important service and that it plays a significant role within the inter-disciplinary team. Participants recognised the need for spiritual care training and skills development, alongside the financial costs of employing dedicated spiritual care workers. In spite of the diversities and resource constraints, the approach of individual hospices to providing spiritual care remained robust. DISCUSSION: Given the diversities that are largely unique to South Africa, shaped essentially by past injustices, the hospices have to navigate considerable hurdles such as cultural differences, religious diversity, and language barriers to provide spiritual care services, within significant resource constraints.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, chest X-ray and LUS features of 50 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of presentation were described. RESULTS: Chest X-ray findings were present in 96% of patients, whereas all patients have ultrasound finding. Proportion (95% CI) of patients having bilateral opacities in chest X-ray was 96% (86.5C98.9%), ground glass opacity 74% (60.5C84.1%), and consolidation 50% (36.7C63.4%). In LUS, shred sign and thickened pleura was present in all patients recruited in this study. Air bronchogram was present in at least one area in 80% of all patients and B-lines score of more than 2 was present in at least one lung area in 84% patients. Number of lung areas with shred sign were higher in hypoxemic (p = 0.005) and tachypneic (p = 0.006) patients and pleura line abnormalities were present in more lung areas in hypoxemic patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: According to our study, LUS is a useful tool not only in diagnosing, but it also correlates with requirement of respiratory support in COVID-19 patients.

Despite not having formal criteria for its diagnosis, COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy has been observed in several studies through biomarkers and imaging. This study aims to estimate the proportion of COVID-19 patients with cardiac abnormalities and to determine the association between the cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity and mortality. Observational studies published from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 were obtained from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI) and preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, ChinaXiv). Studies that have data on prevalence were included in the calculation of the pooled prevalence, while studies with comparison group were included in the calculation of the odds ratio. If multiple tests were done in the same study yielding different prevalence values, the largest one was used as the measure of prevalence of that particular study. Metafor using R software package version 4.0.2 was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 400 records were retrieved from database search, with 24 articles included in the final analysis. Pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in 20 studies was calculated to be 0.31 [95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of (0.23; 0.41)], with statistically significant heterogeneity (percentage of variation or I-squared statistic I(2) = 97%, p < 0.01). Pooled analysis of 19 studies showed an overall odds ratio (OR) of 6.87 [95%-CI (3.92; 12.05)] for cardiac abnormalities associated with disease severity and mortality, with statistically significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 85%, between-study variance or tau-squared statistic (2) = 1.1485, p < 0.01). Due to the high uncertainty in the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and the unquantifiable magnitude of risk (although an increased risk is certain) for severity or mortality among COVID-19 patients, much more long-term prognostic studies are needed to check for the long-term complications of COVID-19 and formalize definitive criteria of COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy.","output":"Prevalence and prognostic associations of cardiac abnormalities among hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The editorial introduces a special section of the Journal of Biomedical Optics on Advances in Terahertz Biomedical Science and Applications.

Difficult decision making has caused moral distress amongst staff;it is essential to address this in order to prevent overwhelming trauma, promote mental resilience and foster hope.MethodsProviding a safe environment was necessary for staff to share their feelings. Under the theme of Let it Go!, for one week staff were asked to write down their feelings anonymously and take a treat thanking them. An overwhelming response demonstrated the pressure placed on peoples feelings of safety and emotional wellbeing. Hospice staff next received a personal thank-you card and a sweet treat, lifting spirits and promoting feelings of value. With staff engagement we then posed a question: What has COVID-19 taught you? Another huge response showed that despite contending with morally traumatic situations, staff demonstrated support for their own psychological resilience in extremely challenging times. Feedback from this work was anonymised and displayed in the hospice, and staff were invited to view their work. The final step in this project was asking the team to share their hopes and wishes for the year ahead, displaying these to encourage our team to begin looking forward and feeling hope in a difficult time.ResultsThe results have been positive. A new feeling of openness and the ability to understand and reflect upon challenges of COVID-19 has contributed to a positive feeling in the hospice. The understanding that we all share common emotional responses is a powerful realisation, staff have shown remarkable bravery in sharing their moral injury.ConclusionThis project has made an impact on many members of the hospice team.

We aimed to assess the effects of training with N95 or higher filter respirators on the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers in the emergency medical center (EMC). METHODS: This randomized crossover study evaluated 23 healthcare providers. Quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) were performed before and after training using three types of N95 or higher filter respirators (cup-type, fold-type, valve-type). Training was performed by lecture, real-time feedback, and fit check. The primary outcome was the fit factor, and the secondary outcomes were overall fit factor, adequate protection rate, and respiratory preference. RESULTS: Fit factors, overall fit factor, and adequate protection rate were higher after training than before training for the 3 types of respirators (all P < .05). For normal breathing, fit factors before and after training were 121 (10C185) vs 192 (161C200) for cup-type, 200 (39C200) vs 200 (200C200) for fold-type, and 85 (18C157) vs 173 (117C200) for valve-type. For normal breathing, the adequate protection rates before and after training were 62 (0C100) vs 100 (90C100) for cup-type, 100 (0C100) vs 100 (100C100) for fold-type, and 19 (0C100) vs 100 (44C100) for valve-type (all P < .05). The most preferred respirator type was the valve-type (10 persons, 45.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Training on wearing an N95 or higher respirator improved the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers working in the EMC.

We show that the virus-encoded miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer and they are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients.

Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms. METHODS: We recruited adult (&#8805;18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine. FINDINGS: On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2-8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57-99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57-99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27-81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35-88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period. INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients &#8804;21 years of age with positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. E-ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were obtained to describe differences in children with and without E-ALT in COVID-19 and MIS-C. RESULTS: E-ALT was detected in 36% of the 291 patients; 31% with COVID-19, and 51% with MIS-C. E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with obesity (P < .001), immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P = .01). In the regression models, E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with higher c-reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01) after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with E-ALT and MIS-C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P = .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS-C, male gender (OR 5.3, P = .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with increased odds of E-ALT. Children with E-ALT in both cohorts had significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS-C had 2.3-fold increased risk of E-ALT compared to COVID-19. No association was found between E-ALT and mortality.

Further, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes with any level of sequence homology to the proteins encoded by any of the coronaviruses tested is well-predicted by their alignment-free phylogenetic distance to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearson's r = ?0.958). No coronavirus in our dataset showed a significant excess of T-cell epitope homology relative to the proportion of expected random matches, given their genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that prior exposure to human or animal-associated coronaviruses cannot completely explain the T-cell repertoire in unexposed individuals that recognise SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive epitopes.","output":"Pre-existing T cell-mediated cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 cannot solely be explained by prior exposure to endemic human coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Research demonstrates a variety of cognitive benefits induced by different chronic physiological stressors (e.g. motor vs. cardiovascular exercise training) and acute exercise to affect steroid hormone secretion, the present study aims to investigate 1.) motor vs. cardiovascular exercise training and their impact on salivary Testosterone, Estradiol and Progesterone and 2.) whether alterations in steroid hormones might moderate exercise-induced cognitive benefits. METHODS In a randomized control trial, 71 preadolescent children (39 girls) at the age of 9-10 years were randomly assigned to a cardiovascular exercise group (CE), a motor exercise group (ME) as well as a control group (CON) in which students were attending assisted homework. The participants attended their program three times per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Steroid hormones in the saliva, working memory performance and state-trait anxiety levels were determined before and after the intervention. RESULTS Statistical analysis showed no chronic changes in hormones through the interventions. Stepwise hierarchical regression revealed the Testosterone*ME-interaction to be a significant moderator for working memory performance post-intervention ( = 0.48, p = 0.014). Within the ME, increases of Testosterone from t1 to t2 were predicting higher working memory performance post-intervention ( = 0.45, R2 = 0.16, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest 1.) that motor-exercise-induced cognitive benefits are moderated by changes in Testosterone and 2.) that a 10-week exercise training of moderate intensity and with a motor demanding vs a cardiovascular character does not affect the chronic concentration of salivary Testosterone, Estradiol and Progesterone nor anxiety levels in preadolescent children.","output":"The effects of an exercise training on steroid hormones in preadolescent children - A moderator for enhanced cognition?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is the single largest risk factor for most chronic diseases, and thus possesses large socioeconomic interest to continuously aging societies.

Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, is the primary driver of these recent trends. The current study used two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and A/J, to investigate the genetics of behavioral responses to fentanyl. Mice were tested for conditioned place preference and fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. C57BL/6J mice formed a conditioned place preference to fentanyl injections and fentanyl increased their activity. Neither effect was noted in A/J mice. We conducted RNA-sequencing on the nucleus accumbens of mice used for fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. Surprisingly, we noted few differentially expressed genes using treatment as the main factor. However many genes differed between strains. We validated differences in two genes: suppressor APC domain containing 1 (Sapcd1) and Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), with quantitative PCR on RNA from the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In both regions A/J mice had significantly higher expression of both genes than did C57BL/6J. In prefrontal cortex, fentanyl treatment decreased Glo1 mRNA. Glyoxalase 1 catalyzes the detoxification of reactive alpha-oxoaldehydes such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, is associated with anxiety and activity levels, and its inhibition reduces alcohol intake.

High academic stress has a negative impact on students learning and overall performance. OBJECTIVE: To assess perceived academic stress, causes, and coping strategies among undergraduate pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Khartoum. Data were collected from randomly selected participants using three validated self-administered questionnaires; perceived stress scale, study habits inventory, and mental health inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and descriptive statistics and chi-square were employed. RESULTS: The response rate in our study was 99.6% (251/252). About 87% of the participants were females. The majority of participants (92%) experience academic stress, with a mean score (24.99  5.159), the level of academic stress ranging from low (4.3%), moderate (73.2%), to high (22.5%). Approximately 80% of the percipients reported academic stress during all exam times with a mean score (25.33  4.976). The level of academic stress was significantly associated with participants gender (P-value: 0.042), and living conditions (P-value: 0.001).

A simple, rapid, and reliable solid-phase extraction (SPE) method for the simultaneous extraction of these two preservatives and their determination by liquid chromatography with a diode array detector was considered. BoxCBehnken design (BBD) was applied to both steps of the SPE process: (i) the sample percolation to ensure the retention of the totality of the acids by the silica-based C18 sorbent; (ii) the elution step to ensure desorption of the totality of the acids from the cartridge. Thus, the volume, pH, and flow rate of the sample, and the percentage of MeOH, volume, and flow rate of the elution solvent, were optimized. Sample volume and pH have a significant influence (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0115) on the percolation yield. However, no effect was recorded for the flow rate (p > 0.05). Flow rate also has no significant effect on the elution efficiency. The proposed new solid-phase extraction method, which can be easily applied to routine monitoring of preservatives BA and SA in juice and soft drink samples, included 0.5 g of C18 sorbent, 1 mL of food drink adjusted to pH 1 and percolated at 4.5 mL min(?1), and 1 mL of a solvent mixture composed of methanol/acidified water (pH = 2.6) (90:10, v/v) used in the elution step at a flow rate of 4.5 mL min(?)(1).

Bone Marrow Transplantation units are facing many challenges complicating admission; deferrals in transplant schedules and even temporary closure. Delay in treatment may have a negative impact in outcomes. Outpatient care has been an alternative to hospital care in patients undergoing HSCT since the 1990s. Potential advantages include improved patient independence and satisfaction, improved quality of life, and less hospital resource utilization, which is of particular importance during this epidemic. In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic in our outpatient HSCT program. Objective: To describe the outcomes of patients undergoing ambulatory HSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adults and children with any hematological disease undergoing any type of HSCT with an outpatient intent from March to July 2020 were included. All were required to have a Karnofsky score >70%, serum creatinine <2 mg/dL, temporary residence near the hospital, an adequate caregiver, with appropriate educational level and history of treatment adherence. All cases lacked alternative therapies and were discussed thoroughly and approved by our transplant committee. After infusion, patients stayed at home and were seen in the outpatient clinic every other day until hospitalization requirement or engraftment; afterward weekly and bi-weekly through day +100. Patients were instructed to stay at home isolation 14 days before the procedure, and to report the presence of fever, to notify any COVID-19 contact or symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and anosmia. All patients and caregivers were screened with questionnaires according to the updated COVID-19 case definition. Hand and respiratory hygiene were recommended for donors, receptors, and health workers. Proper personal protective equipment was used according to WHO guidelines. Only a single caregiver was allowed during outpatient visits and hospitalization. Results: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico (February 28th 2020) 21 HSCT have been conducted with ambulatory intent. Fourteen allogeneic (allo-HSCT, 66.6%) (10 haploidentical, 4 matched related donors) and 7 autologous (auto-HSCT) (33.3%%) transplants have been performed. The median age was 27 years (range, 3-70) for allogeneic HSCT and 30 years for autologous (range, 2-63). Acute leukemia (5 lymphoblastic, 5 myeloblastic) was the most common indication for allo-HSCT, and multiple myeloma for auto-HSCT. PCR for SARS-Cov2 was tested only in 1 receptor before the transplant, due to prior test unavailability in asymptomatic persons. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. All received conditioning as outpatients. Twelve (57.4%) were never hospitalized (4/7 auto and 8/14 allo-HSCT) with a median age of 32.5 (range, 16-70). For allo-HSCT median length of stay (LOS) was 2 days (range, 0-21) while for auto-HSCT was 0 days (range, 0-9). The most common reason for hospitalization was febrile neutropenia (n=6, 46%). A median of 7 visits per patient (4-14) were required until day +100 or last follow-up in the outpatient clinic and complemented with 4 (1-18) telemedicine consults. No one died from transplant related mortality. No cases of COVID19 were documented. Conclusion: Outpatient transplantation is a feasible alternative for performing HSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic minimizing the risk of infection and providing a safe environment for patients, donors, and healthcare providers.

Isolation strategy with quarantine is a useful model in controlling transmission and rapid spread. As a result, people remained at home and disrupted their outside daily activities. It led to the closure of educational institutes, which is a source of many students to cope with numerous personal and familial issues. This study aims to focus on exploring the relationships and potential mediational pathways between mental health problems, illness perception, anxiety and depression disorders. Design/methodology/approach: The study incorporated snowball sampling techniques through a cross-sectional, Web-based survey and recruited 500 students from different universities of twin cities, Rawalpindi and Islamabad from March 23 to April 15, 2020, during the coronavirus outbreak lockdown. The study used four instruments, Beck Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire and The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale for assessing depression, anxiety, illness perception and mental health disorders. Findings: The findings indicated normal (43.2%), mild (20.5%), moderate (13.6%) and severe (22.7%) levels of anxiety prevalence in students. Results specified a normal (65.9%), mild (9.10%), moderate (9.12%) and severe (15.90%) depression prevalence and findings stipulated that anxiety disorder prevalence was higher than depression disorder. The correlational results specified a negative and significant relationship between mental health, illness perception, anxiety and depression symptoms. The multiple regression analysis stated that anxiety and depression disorders mediated the relationship between mental health and present illness perception. The perception of illness exhibited a relation to depression and anxiety disorders. Originality/value: The study proposed a model to address mental health problems during the lockdown. The (2019-nCoV) illness perception developed mental disorders, including anxiety and depression, which has declined individuals' mental health. There is an urgent need for ongoing clinical examination and management to address psychological disorders and findings suggest assessing mental health to combatting the pandemic worldwide. Findings recommend developing strategies to promote mental health-care facilities during COVID-19 wide-ranging disasters. These results highlight the impending importance of devising strategies to treat mental health problems.

We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting  agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABACLAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting  agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABACLAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. FINDINGS: We identified 148 557 people with COPD and 818 490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABACLAMA combinations (adjusted HR 139 [95% CI 110C176]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (155 [110C218]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (114 [085C154]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 143). INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

We will present an analysis of the psychosocial effects of COVID-19: first, a cross-sectional study in an Ecuadorian sample (n = 301) and second, a comparative study between two samples from the Ecuadorian and Spanish populations (n = 83 each one). Participants completed an online survey to (1) describe how they felt (depression, anxiety, and stress) before and after confinement; (2) analyze which emotional and behavioral variables predict depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress perceived after the confinement; (3) carry out a comparative study in a sample of Ecuadorian and Spanish surveys. Results indicate, first, that Ecuadorians experience significantly more depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress after confinement. Second, variables which predict depressive symptoms and anxiety are greater public prosocial tendency, less stress as a challenge, and greater stress as a threat, as well as an empathetic tendency that implies greater emotional regulation. Experienced stress after confinement was predicted by a greater public prosocial tendency, as well as an empathetic tendency. Finally, scores for depression, anxiety, and stress are higher after confinement in both countries. However, results reveal the similarity of the psychosocial effects that are being experienced, regardless of the country, and the differences in the variables that can help explain these effects.

Diets were evaluated using the Nutrient Rich Diet score (NRD15.3), diet-related greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and a diet similarity index that quantified the proportion of food intake that remained similar as compared with the observed diet. SETTING National dietary surveys of four European countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy and France). SUBJECTS Approximately 6500 adults, aged 18-64 years. RESULTS When dietary preferences were prioritised, NRD153 was ~6 % higher, GHGE was ~4 % lower and ~85 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of fruit, vegetables and whole grains than the observed diet. When nutrient quality was prioritised, NRD153 was ~16 % higher, GHGE was ~3 % lower and ~72 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of legumes and fish and lower amounts of sweetened and alcoholic beverages. Finally, when environmental impact was prioritised, NRD153 was ~9 % higher, GHGE was ~21 % lower and ~73 % of food intake remained similar.

Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD).

However, its potential for maintaining outpatient care at pre-pandemic levels during these rapidly changing times is untested. Therefore, we analyzed our experience in a tertiary care epilepsy center. Methods: We divided the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020 into a baseline, transition (to telemedicine), and current phase. We divided outpatient encounters into clinic, virtual (using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online platform), and telephone (including commercial video conferencing platforms). Results: Completed outpatient visits during baseline and current period were 595 and 590, respectively. Nearly 1 out of 4 patients missed outpatient visits during the transition period. The virtual visits accounted for 19.7% of completed visits during baseline and increased to 66.8% during the current period. There were no telephone visits during the baseline phase but accounted for 26.1% of completed visits during the current phase.

Methods Self-reported changes in alcohol and tobacco use during the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic were recorded in 495 Slovenian adults, as part of the European Alcohol Use and COVID-19 survey. Results About half of the Slovenian sample indicated that the frequency of drinking occasions did not change in the months after the pandemics outbreak, while the remainder stated either a decrease (26.0%) or an increase (24.2%). 23.1% reported a decrease and 17.3% an increase in the quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion. Respondents who reported that their overall alcohol consumption decreased were more likely to be male than female and more likely to be younger than middle-aged. Those who reported experiencing at least a substantial level of distress due to financial loss were at a four-times increased risk of reporting an increase in their alcohol consumption compared to individuals who reported no or only some financial distress.

No matter the positive function or negative effect of information dissemination, it involves the publics risk perception and behavior. This study was designed to contribute to the existing research on how official social media information quality (IQ) and risk perception (RP) affect preventive behavior (PB) and continued use behavior (CB) of official social media during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: The required data were extracted from a national online survey of the Chinese Mainland during March 24C30 2020, a random sample was asked to participate in the survey (n = 666). Data analysis was performed using regression analysis, structural equation modeling, mediating effect analysis, and one-way ANOVA analysis. RESULTS: The results show that IQ (10.010  3.568) has direct and indirect positive impact on PB (9.475  3.571), and has a low significant positive indirect impact on CB (3.739  1.566).

Large numbers of available sequences and their dates of transmission provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze evolutionary adaptation in novel ways. Addition of high-resolution structural information can reveal the functional basis of these processes at the molecular level. Integrated systems biology-directed analyses of these data layers afford valuable insights to build a global understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Here we identify globally distributed haplotypes from 15,789 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and model their success based on their duration, dispersal, and frequency in the host population. Our models identify mutations that are likely compensatory adaptive changes that allowed for rapid expansion of the virus. Functional predictions from structural analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports, the Asp(614)Gly mutation in the spike glycoprotein (S) likely reduced transmission and the subsequent Pro(323)Leu mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase led to the precipitous spread of the virus. Our model also suggests that two mutations in the nsp13 helicase allowed for the adaptation of the virus to the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Finally, our explainable artificial intelligence algorithm identified a mutational hotspot in the sequence of S that also displays a signature of positive selection and may have implications for tissue or cell-specific expression of the virus.

METHODS A prospectively collected database for RADP was retrieved for analysis. Patients were categorized as obese (BMI 30 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). Demographics, perioperative data, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, diagnosis, conversion rate, morbidity, surgical mortality, pancreatic fistula rate, and length of stay were compared. RESULTS A total for 85 RADP were included, with 57 (67%) in the nonobese group and 28 (33%) in the obese group. No differences were found between nonobese and obese patients regarding demographic, preoperative risk, and perioperative parameters and mortality. There was a trend in the obese group associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications, but it was statistically insignificant. Clinically significant pancreatic fistula (grade B) occurred in 28.5% of obese patients and in 7% of nonobese patients, but without statistical significance (P = .064). CONCLUSIONS Obesity does not have a significant impact on the perioperative outcomes and surgical risks for patients undergoing RADP, but high BMI may be a predictor for pancreatic fistula after RADP.","output":"Impact of Obesity on Robot-Assisted Distal Pancreatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients can be complicated by multiple factors. Decisions to administer opioids, sedatives, and antipsychotic medications are frequently driven by a desire to facilitate patients' comfort and their tolerance of invasive procedures or other interventions within the ICU. Despite accumulating evidence supporting new strategies to optimize pain, sedation, and delirium practices in the ICU, many critical care practitioners continue to embrace false perceptions regarding appropriate management in these critically ill patients. This article explores these perceptions in more detail and offers new evidence-based strategies to help critical care practitioners better manage sedation and delirium, particularly in ICU patients.","output":"Top 10 myths regarding sedation and delirium in the ICU."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 anthropause has impacted human activities and behaviour, resulting in substantial environmental and ecological changes.

Despite that, transport operators are often in situations that require them to cope with complex working conditions that lead to negative emotions such as anger. The current study represents a segment of the permanent global research agenda that seeks to devise and test a psychometric scale for measuring driving anger in professional drivers. The present research is one of the first attempts to examine the factorial validity and the cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the broadly utilized Driving Anger Scale (DAS) in three culturally different countries within the Western Balkans region. The respondents (N = 1054) were taxi, bus and truck drivers between 19 and 75 years of age. The results pertaining to confirmatory factor analysis showed that there were adequate fit statistics for the specified six-dimensional measurement model of the DAS. The measurement invariance testing showed that the meaning and psychometric performance of driving anger and its facets are equivalent across countries and types of professional drivers. Furthermore, the results showed that driving anger facets had positive correlations with dysfunctional ways of expressing anger and negative correlations with the form of the prosocial anger expression. In addition, the results revealed that taxi drivers displayed considerably higher levels of anger while driving and aggressive driving than truck and bus drivers. Overall, this study replicates and extends the accumulated knowledge of previous investigations, suggesting that the original DAS remains a reliable and stable instrument for measuring driving anger in day-to-day driving conditions.","output":"Differences in Driving Anger among Professional Drivers: A Cross-Cultural Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There has been a significant increase in number of patients seeking neuropsychological rehabilitation months after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE Identify the cognitive and psychiatric disorders in patients with long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) and explore the association between disease severity during the acute phase and persistent neuropsychological manifestations. METHODS 614 adults were assessed an average of eight months post-infection. Participants were, on average, 47.6 y.o., who sought rehabilitation for neuropsychological problems. Patients were evaluated using the Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS), Phonemic Verbal Fluency and Clock Drawing tests (NEUPSILIN) for executive functions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS The BNIS score was significantly below reference values in all subscales, especially affect and memory. Verbal Fluency and Clock Drawing subtest results were also lower. Patients with PASC tested high for anxiety/depression, but there was no statistically significant relationship between HADS and BNIS scores. Neuropsychological evaluations showed no differences in cognitive or psychiatric profiles between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions.Methods: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, United Kingdom, Philippines, and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of inability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis.Findings: In all examined countries, lower socioeconomic quintiles were likely to experience disproportionately more income loss and greater inability to socially distance during lockdown. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 40% (30% Chile - 55% UK) to 60% (57% Chile - 67% UK). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.5% GDP.Interpretation: We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. We highlight potential for social protection to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they suffer the worst income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.Funding: This work was supported by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome [grant number 221303/Z/20/Z].Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.","output":"Exploring Equity in Health and Poverty Impacts of Control Measures for SARS-CoV-2 in Six Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, has been recently approved for the off-label indication of cytokine release syndrome in the background of COVID-19, by the Drug Controller General of India.

Outdoor workers are being exposed to increasing wildfire-related particulate matter and smoke. Recognizing this emerging risk, Washington adopted an emergency rule and is presently engaged in creating a permanent rule to protect outdoor workers from wildfire smoke exposure. While there are growing bodies of literature on the exposure to and health effects of wildfire smoke in the general public and wildland firefighters, there is a gap in knowledge about wildfire smoke exposure among outdoor workers generally, and construction workers specifically, a large category of outdoor workers in Washington totaling 200,000 people. In this study, we link several data sources including state-collected employment data and national ambient air quality data to gain insight into the risk of wildfire exposure among construction workers in Washington. Our results indicate the number of poor air quality days has increased in August and September in recent years. We also observed that over the last decade these months with the greatest potential for wildfire smoke exposure coincide with an annual peak in construction employment that was typically 9.4 to 42.7% larger across Washington counties (one county was 75.8%). Lastly, we considered different air quality thresholds and retrospectively tallied days in Washington that would have triggered rules protecting workers from wildfire smoke. We found the \\"encouraged\\" threshold of the Washington emergency rule (20.5 g/m3) would result in 5.5 times more days subject to the wildfire rule on average across all Washington counties compared to its \\"required\\" threshold (55.5 g/m3), and in 2020 the rule could have created demand for 1.35 million N-95 filtering facepiece respirators among construction workers. These results have important implications for both employers and policy makers as rules are developed.

Three hundred forty-six adults who had self-diagnosed colds of 48 h or less were enrolled in a study during September and October 1994 to determine the frequency and clinical course of HRV infections. Nasal wash specimens for viral culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for HRV RNA and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E RNA detection were collected on enrollment, and participants recorded their symptoms twice daily for 14 days. Middle ear pressure (MEP) was measured with a digital tympanometer on days 1 and 7. Picornaviruses (224 HRV and 7 enterovirus isolates) were detected by culture in 67% (231 of 346) of the subjects. Among 114 samples negative by culture, HRV was detected by RT-PCR in 52 (46%) for an overall picornavirus infection rate of 82% (283 of 346 subjects). Among the remaining 62 negative samples, human coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 5 patients, so that 288 (83%) of patients had documented viral infection. The first symptom noticed most often was sore throat (40%) in HRV culture- or PCR-positive patients and stuffy nose in HRV-negative patients (27%). No differences in symptom scores over time or in the presence of individual symptoms were noted between groups. The median duration of the cold episodes was 11 days in HRV culture-positive patients, 9.5 days in HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 11.5 days in HRV-negative patients.

Multiple societal and governmental guidelines on the use of PPE during medical procedures are available on Internet websites;however, there is limited literature available in peer-reviewed formats in this context. This study aims to provide an overview of current PPE donning and doffing protocols specific to the catheterization laboratory. Methods: A series of internet searches regarding donning and doffing of PPE in the CCL including published articles and internet protocols were compiled and compared using Pubmed.gov, Google.com, www.twitter.com, and www.youtube.com. Results: Most institutions used N95 masks, shoe covers, at least one head covering, face shield or goggles, two pairs of gloves, and inner and outer gowns. Doffing variation was greater than donning. Doffing has the potential to contaminate the healthcare worker (HCW), and therefore, this step of PPE management requires further study. Common steps in temporal priority included cleaning of gloved hands, removal of outer (or only) gown, removal of outer gloves, repeat gloved hand cleaning, removal of facial PPE last, and a final non-gloved hand cleaning.

METHODS: Using a key informant interview guide and data collection template, researchers who were embedded in each health care system cataloged and summarized current and future practices supporting ZS, including, (1) the function addressed; (2) a description of practice intent and mechanism of intervention; (3) the target patient population and service setting; (4) when/how the practice was (or will be) implemented; and (5) whether/how the practice was documented and/or measured. Normalization process theory (NPT), an implementation evaluation framework, was applied to help understand how ZS had been operationalized in routine clinical practices and, specifically, what ZS practices were described by key informants (coherence), the current state of norms/conventions supporting these practices (cognitive participation), how health care teams performed these practices (collective action), and whether/how practices were measured when they occurred (reflexive monitoring). RESULTS: The most well-defined and consistently measured ZS practices (current and future) focused on the identification of patients at high risk of suicide.

The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors. Extensive use of atazanavir (ATV) as antiretroviral and previous evidence suggesting its bioavailability within the respiratory tract prompted us to study this molecule against SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that ATV docks in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV, blocking Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells and a human pulmonary epithelial cell line. ATV/RTV also impaired virus-induced enhancement of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) levels. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"Atazanavir, Alone or in Combination with Ritonavir, Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Proinflammatory Cytokine Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our aim was to analyze the association between previously diagnosed lifetime depression and changes in physical activity (PA), TV-viewing, consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as frequency of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, older people are particularly susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection developing into severe disease. The objective of this review was to examine the literature regarding factors that may explain the tendency of this population to develop severe COVID-19. Research articles considered in this review were searched for in EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science from December 2019 to December 2020. Citations were screened by two independent reviewers. Studies of the immune system in older individuals found alterations in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The adaptive system is depressed in its functions, and the innate system is in a pro-inflammatory state that can lead to chronic disease. This pro-inflammatory state may be related to a severe course of disease in COVID-19. This review shows that the level of evidence supporting an association between immune alterations in the elderly and susceptibly to severe progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally consistent.

We sought to determine if microcoil-dependent interactions with thrombus induce structural and mechanical changes in the adjacent fibrin network. Such changes could play an important role in the prevention of aneurysm rebleeding. METHODS The stiffness of in vitro human blood clots and coil-clot complexes implanted into aneurysm phantoms were measured immediately after formation and after retraction for 3 days using unconfined uniaxial compression assays. Scanning electron microscopy of the coil-clot complexes showed the effect of coiling on clot structure. RESULTS The coil packing densities achieved were in the range of clinical practice. Bare platinum coils increased clot stiffness relative to clot alone (Young's modulus 6.9 kPa and 0.83 kPa, respectively) but did not affect fibrin structure. Hydrogel-coated coils prevented formation of a clot and had no significant effect on clot stiffness (Young's modulus 2 kPa) relative to clot alone. Clot age decreased fiber density by 0.2 fibers/m(2) but not the stiffness of the bare platinum coil-clot complex. CONCLUSIONS The stiffness of coil-clot complexes is related to the summative stiffness of the fibrin network and associated microcoils. Hydrogel-coated coils exhibit significantly less stiffness due to the mechanical properties of the hydrogel and the inhibition of fibrin network formation by the hydrogel. These findings have important implications for the design and engineering of aneurysm occlusion devices.","output":"Mechanical properties and fibrin characteristics of endovascular coil-clot complexes: relevance to endovascular cerebral aneurysm repair paradigms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I extend the standard specification of the empirical similarity (ES) model of Gilboa et al.

Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is responsible of the majority of adverse cardiovascular events. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is easily obtainable method to assess ED accurately. It is aimed to evaluate ED by measuring FMD following COVID-19 disease. Methods: : Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease were recruited to the hospital two month after the discharge. Sex and age-matched healthy subjects were determined as the control group. Blood samples and FMD measurements were obtained from each participant. All subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of ED determined by FMD measurements. These two groups were compared in terms of demographic features and the presence of recovered COVID-19 disease. Results: : A total of 92 subjects were included in the study.

Methods: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. Findings: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132).

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the kynurenine pathway by transforming l-tryptophan (Trp) into l-kynurenine (Kyn), a metabolite endowed with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. In dendritic cells, IL-6 induces IDO1 proteasomal degradation and shuts down IDO1-mediated immunosuppressive effects. In tumor cells, IL-6 upregulates IDO1 expression and favors tumor immune escape mechanisms. To investigate the role of IDO1 and its possible relationship with IL-6 in obesity, we induced the disease by feeding mice with a high fat diet (HFD). Mice on a standard diet were used as control. Experimental obesity was associated with high IDO1 expression and Kyn levels in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral white adipose tissue (SVF WAT). IDO1-deficient mice on HFD gained less weight and were less insulin resistant as compared to wild type counterparts. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist, to mice on HFD significantly reduced weight gain, controlled adipose tissue hypertrophy, increased insulin sensitivity, and induced a better glucose tolerance. TCZ also induced a dramatic inhibition of IDO1 expression and Kyn production in the SVF WAT. Thus our data indicated that the IL-6/IDO1 axis may play a pathogenetic role in a chronic, low-grade inflammation condition, and, perhaps most importantly, IL-6R blockade may be considered a valid option for obesity treatment.","output":"Pathogenetic Interplay Between IL-6 and Tryptophan Metabolism in an Experimental Model of Obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsCOVID-19 can spread rapidly in psychiatric inpatient settings.

The aim of this project was to improve the care of patients with COVID-19 in psychiatric inpatient settings.MethodA baseline audit was conducted of care COVID-19 patients received in wards that experienced outbreaks in January 2021 in a London Mental Health Trust. Clinical notes were reviewed for management plans, including clear documentation of risk of serious illness, frequency of vitals monitoring, and thresholds for escalation to medical teams.A new protocol was subsequently developed and implemented at one inpatient unit: COVID-19: Early Identification of Risk and Management. This included an adjusted 4C mortality score to determine risk of deterioration, and schedules for observation monitoring based on this outcome. Each schedule specified separate frequencies of monitoring of critical observations (oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and routine observations, thus minimising unnecessary staff exposure. It prompted venous thromboembolism (VTE) assessment and documentation of escalation criteria.Result44 patients were identified across three working age (WAA, n = 29) and two older age (OA, n = 15) adult wards. 7.5% of WAA and 33.3% of OA patients were hospitalised. 20% of OA patients died following a positive test. 58% of patients had a documented management plan for COVID-19, but only 56% mentioned observation frequency, 19% escalation criteria, and 9% risk of serious disease. No patient received a repeat VTE assessment following diagnosis. The audit identified inconsistent approaches to COVID-19 management between wards, and found no relationship between risk of deterioration and frequency of observation monitoring. Following implementation of this protocol, 100% (n = 4) of patients had a robust plan for COVID-19 management, and 100% received a VTE assessment.ConclusionThe audit supported previous findings that psychiatric inpatients are at risk of serious COVID-19 infection. This highlights an urgent clinical and ethical need to optimise COVID-19 care in psychiatric inpatient settings. The results of this audit suggest that risk factors for severe infection and elements of routine care are not widely understood or implemented by clinical staff.

The values of electron density distribution, highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and electron density distribution gradient for each constructed model are obtained. As a result of quantum chemical modeling, it was found that silver nanoparticles can interact with the following amino acids: Proline, glutamine, lysine, arginine, asparagine, histidine, glutamic and aspartic acids, tryptophan, and cysteine, which is due to the presence of additional -NH2, -NH, -SH and -COOH groups in these amino acids that are not involved in the formation of a peptide bond.

RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7-12) days. A significant increase in the immune-suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright /CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission (p=0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright /CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID19 patients.","output":"An increase in CD62Ldim neutrophils precedes the development of pulmonary embolisms in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artikel ini bertujuan untuk menjelaskan pengalaman menggunakan video tutorial untuk mendukung kegiatan pembelajaran daring di masa pendemi virus corona dan respons mahasiswa terhadap penggunaan video tutorial.

Over-activation of the complement system plays an important role in inflammation, tissue damage, and infectious disease severity. The prevalence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia remains significant and cases are still being reported. The role of complement in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pathogenesis and complement-modulating treatment strategies has received limited attention, and studies involving MERS-CoV-infected patients have not been reported. This study offers the first insight into the pulmonary expression profile including seven complement proteins, complement regulatory factors, IL-8, and RANTES in MERS-CoV infected patients without underlying chronic medical conditions. Our results significantly indicate high expression levels of complement anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), IL-8, and RANTES in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected patients. The upregulation of lung complement anaphylatoxins, C5a, and C3a was positively correlated with IL-8, RANTES, and the fatality rate. Our results also showed upregulation of the positive regulatory complement factor P, suggesting positive regulation of the complement during MERS-CoV infection. High levels of lung C5a, C3a, factor P, IL-8, and RANTES may contribute to the immunopathology, disease severity, ARDS development, and a higher fatality rate in MERS-CoV-infected patients. These findings highlight the potential prognostic utility of C5a, C3a, IL-8, and RANTES as biomarkers for MERS-CoV disease severity and mortality. To further explore the prediction of functional partners (proteins) of highly expressed proteins (C5a, C3a, factor P, IL-8, and RANTES), the computational proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and six proteins (hub nodes) were identified.

The PROMISE-EPI study aims to address the latter by identifying HIV infected mothers during an almost never-missed visit for their infant, the second extended program on immunization visit at 6-8 weeks of age (EPI-2). The study is divided into 3 components inclusive of an open-label randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the efficacy of a responsive preventive intervention compared to routine intervention based on the national PMTCT guidelines for HIV-1 uninfected exposed breastfeeding infants. The preventive intervention includes: a) Point of care testing for early infant HIV diagnosis and maternal viral load; b) infant, single-drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) (lamivudine) if mothers are virally unsuppressed. The primary outcome is HIV-transmission rate from EPI-2 to 12 months. The study targets to screen 37,000 mother/infant pairs in Zambia and Burkina Faso to identify 2000 mother/infant pairs for the clinical trial. The study design and challenges faced during study implementation are described, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the amended HIV guidelines in Zambia in 2020 (triple-drug PrEP in HIV exposed infants guided by quarterly maternal viral load).

METHODS: Eighty-three patients with LABC were scanned with 7 MHz ultrasound before starting NAC (week 0) and during treatment (week 4). Spectral parametric maps were generated corresponding to tumor volume. Twenty-four textural features (QUS-Tex1) were determined from parametric maps acquired using grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) for each patient, which were further processed to generate 64 texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2), leading to a total of 95 features from each time point. Analysis was carried out on week 4 data and compared to baseline (week 0) data. ?Week 4 data was obtained from the difference in QUS parameters, texture features (QUS-Tex1), and texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2) of week 4 data and week 0 data. Patients were divided into two groups: recurrence and non-recurrence. Machine learning algorithms using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to generate radiomic models. Internal validation was undertaken using leave-one patient out cross-validation method. RESULTS: With a median follow up of 69 months (range 7-118 months), 28 patients had disease recurrence. The k-NN classifier was the best performing algorithm at week 4 with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) of 87%, 75%, 81%, and 0.83, respectively. The inclusion of texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2) in week 4 QUS data analysis led to the improvement of the classifier performances. The AUC increased from 0.70 (0.59 to 0.79, 95% confidence interval) without texture derivatives to 0.83 (0.73 to 0.92) with texture derivatives. The most relevant features separating the two groups were higher-order texture derivatives obtained from scatterer diameter and acoustic concentration-related parametric images. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study highlighting the utility of QUS radiomics in the prediction of recurrence during the treatment of LABC. It reflects that the ongoing treatment-related changes can predict clinical outcomes with higher accuracy as compared to pretreatment features alone.","output":"Early Changes in Quantitative

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently released recommendations that health-care facilities temporarily delay elective surgeries and non-essential medical procedures. Disruptions to medical care significantly impacted cancer patients, with cancer screenings halted and nonurgent cancer surgeries postponed as health-care facilities shifted resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it has been reported that cancer screening rates decreased dramatically in the United States in 2020, it is unclear whether this trend was driven by factors related to public interest in cancer and/or cancer screening as opposed to other factors such as clinical backlogs, pandemic-related policies, and/or resource limitations. The purpose of this study was to use the Google Trends tool to evaluate public interest in six common malignancies and four common cancer screening methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used the Google Trends tool to quantify public interest in six different malignancies (Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, Lung Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, and Cervical Cancer) and four cancer screening methods (Pap Smear, Lung Cancer Screening, Mammogram, and Colonoscopy) in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Welchs t-tests were used to compare monthly search volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) to the 4 years before the pandemic (2016 C 2019) for all ten search terms included in our study. We used Benjamini-Hochberg to adjust raw p values to account for multiple statistical comparisons. The level of statistical significance was defined by choosing a false discovery rate of 0.05. RESULTS: Our results indicate significantly reduced interest in all malignancies studied at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public interest in [Breast Cancer], [Colon Cancer], [Lung Cancer], [Thyroid Cancer], and [Cervical Cancer] significantly decreased in the months of March, April, May, and June 2020 when compared with public interest in 2016-2019. Public interest in cancer screening methods such as [Pap Smear], [Lung Cancer Screening], [Mammogram], and [Colonoscopy] significantly deceased in the months of April and May compared to 2016 C 2019 values. However, decreased public interest in cancer screening methods was temporary, with Google search volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in June 2020 C December 2020. CONCLUSION: There was significantly reduced public interest in both common malignancies and cancer screening methods at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, after an initial decline, public interest as indicated by Google search volumes quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the calendar year 2020. In addition, trends in public interest in cancer screening as indicated by Google search volumes aligned with cancer screening uptake rates in the United States during the study period. This finding suggests that Google Trends may serve as an effective tool in gauging the publics interest in cancer and/or cancer screenings in the United States, which makes it a valuable resource that can be used to inform decisions aimed at improving cancer screening rates in the future. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: The Google Trends tool can be used to measure public interest in various malignancies and their associated screening methods.

The results revealed that when equal dosages of H2O2 are applied, PAHs are significantly removed following oxidation treatment, and the removal percentages obeyed the following sequence: CF > GMF > MF > LF. In addition, higher dosages of H2O2 improved the PAH removal from soil treated with the same oxidation mode.

PATIENTS Children aged between 1 month and 15 years, consecutively admitted between August 2008 and July 2010, with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome that developed at least 12 hours after invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We used logistic regression models to explore the relationship between death and independent variables. Of 3,046 patients admitted to the three PICUs, 1,658 patients underwent mechanical ventilation, and 84 fulfilled the acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Nearly 60% were boys, and the median age was 31 months.

The first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia was announced on March 2, 2020. Several psychiatric manifestations may appear during pandemics, especially among frontline healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore depression and anxiety levels among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 502 healthcare providers in the Ministry of Health. Depression and anxiety were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: The respondents represented various healthcare occupations: administrators (28.49%), nurses (26.29%), physicians (22.11%), non-physician specialists (13.94%), technicians (6.77%), and pharmacists (2.30%). The majority of them were male (68.1%). More than half of them had depressive disorder (55.2%), which ranged from mild (24.9%), moderate (14.5%), and moderately severe (10%) to severe (5.8%). Half of the sample had generalized anxiety disorder (51.4%), which ranged from mild (25.1%) and moderate (11%) to severe (15.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that males were significantly less predicted to have anxiety (Beta = ?0.22, P-value <0.04), 30C39 years age group were significantly more predicted to have depression and anxiety group (Beta = 0.204, P-value <0.001 and beta = 0.521, P-value <0.003 respectively), and nurses had significantly higher mean score of anxiety (Beta = 0.445, P-value <0.026).

Prior studies have analyzed trial termination, but it has not been easy to assess accrual estimates using international databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov because of limitations in accessing accrual information. Specifically, it is not easy to extract both anticipated and actual accrual of clinical trials. We designed a new algorithmic approach to extracting trial accrual data from ClinicalTrials.gov and used it to estimate the sufficiency of patient accrual onto genitourinary (GU) cancer trials. METHODS: We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for completed/terminated phase II and III clinical trials for prostate, bladder, kidney, testicular, and ureteral cancers registered after 2007. We extracted trial characteristics from available XML files. We then used a Python algorithm to access prior trial registrations on the ClinicalTrials.gov archive site and extract both anticipated and actual accrual numbers. We then compared the actual accrual of each trial to its anticipated accrual and defined sufficient accrual as 85% of anticipated accrual. RESULTS: The algorithm was 100% accurate compared with hand extraction in a small validation subset. A total of 925 trials were included, of which 840 (91%) had both anticipated and actual accrual.

Our objective was to identify from the international literature the symptoms most commonly experienced by older adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE between 1 December 2019 and 13 April 2020. The methodological quality analysis used a method dedicated to case series and case reports. Of the 260 articles initially identi?ed, only two studies were ultimately included in the qualitative analysis. The mean age was relatively low, between 71 and 74 years on average. COVID-19 symptoms were as follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhoea and, to a lesser extent, myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Lymphopenia was noted from complete blood counts. In conclusion, this systematic review of the international literature reveals a lack of data about the semiology of COVID-19 in older adults, especially in very elderly frail people, who are normally considered to constitute the geriatric population.

We conceptualise urban air pollution as entwined in its making and consequence with the diverse rhythms of technologies, social practices and socio-temporal structures, environmental and atmospheric processes, bodily movements in space and time, and rhythmically constituted corporeality. Through this interdisciplinary account we position urban air pollution as integral to the beat of the city, both a product of and constituent part of its evolving spatiotemporal form. We build on this foundation to develop a polyrhythmic conceptualisation of how certain places and lives are more dominated by pollution than others. Unequal patternings are made through the structuring effects of rhythmic repetition and by fatal intersections between the rhythms of polluted air and unequal capacities to avoid harmful breathing in and to resist the arrhythmic corporeal consequences that can follow. Understanding inequalities as manifest not within a static landscape of spatial relations, but in sets of unequally unfolding and structured polyrhythmic relations has implications for revealing patterns of inequality and for extending evidence-making more deeply into how rhythms intersect. Which and whose rhythms are to be intervened in are also considered as key ethical and political questions. We draw out implications for activism and community action, and identify the potential for bringing rhythmanalysis into productive engagement with broader environmental justice concerns, including in relation to recent COVID-19 experiences.","output":"Breathing in the polyrhythmic city: A spatiotemporal, rhythmanalytic account of urban air pollution and its inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sleep had never been assessed immediately after extubation in patients still in the ICU. However, sleep deprivation may alter respiratory function and may promote respiratory failure. We hypothesized that sleep alterations after extubation could be associated with an increased risk of post-extubation respiratory failure and reintubation. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study performed at the medical ICU of the university hospital of Poitiers in France. Patients at high-risk of extubation failure (> 65 years, with any underlying cardiac or lung disease, or intubated > 7 days) were included. Patients intubated less than 24 h, with central nervous or psychiatric disorders, continuous sedation, neuroleptic medication, or uncooperative were excluded. Sleep was assessed by complete polysomnography just following extubation including the night. The main objective was to compare sleep between patients who developed post-extubation respiratory failure or required reintubation and the others. RESULTS: Over a 3-year period, 52 patients had complete polysomnography among whom 12 (23%) developed post-extubation respiratory failure and 8 (15%) required reintubation. Among them, 10 (19%) had atypical sleep, 15 (29%) had no deep sleep, and 33 (63%) had no rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Total sleep time was 3.2 h in median [interquartile range, 2.0C4.4] in patients who developed post-extubation respiratory failure vs. 2.0 [1.1C3.8] in those who were successfully extubated (p = 0.34). Total sleep time, and durations of deep and REM sleep stages did not differ between patients who required reintubation and the others. Reintubation rates were 21% (7/33) in patients with no REM sleep and 5% (1/19) in patients with REM sleep (difference, ? 16% [95% CI ? 33% to 6%]; p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep assessment by polysomnography after extubation showed a dramatically low total, deep and REM sleep time.

However, studies have reported diverse findings, with some consumer groups exhibiting an increase and others a decrease in their alcohol purchase and consumption patterns. Although the long-lasting changes in alcohol consumption, if any, are still unknown, the current situation has effectively accelerated a number of pre-existing trends which will likely continue in the future. E-commerce is growing steadily, mainly because of the restrictions within the on-trade channel and concerns around catching COVID-19 amongst consumers, thus lifting traditional barriers to the adoption of digital channels. Premiumization has also grown significantly during the pandemic, especially in the spirits category, due, in part, to the fact that consumers have been increasingly trying to recreate bar and restaurant quality gastronomic experiences in the privacy of their own homes. The trend toward homemade experiences is multi-stakeholder as consumers, retailers, restaurateurs, bar owners, and brands all try to help facilitate at-home consumption experiences. Larger size purchases seem to reflect not only the stockpiling phenomena that occurred during the initial phases of the pandemic but also convenience for consumers (e.g., avoiding queues). Additionally, the growing home mixology movement has been observed to result in consumers buying larger amounts of alcohol in order to facilitate cocktail making experimentation at home. It is important to stress, though, that this review was specially focused on available data from the first three quarters of 2020, as an effort to identify and understand the initial impacts the COVID-19 was creating amongst alcohol consumers.

The growing volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift.

Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, some HIV protease inhibitors are presently being used against SARS-CoV2. However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs.

Within psychiatry, there was an expectation that junior doctors would be redeployed, with senior psychiatrists stepping down to cover physical health and on-call duties. Senior leadership in mental health trusts were also preparing for COVID-19 outbreaks on psychiatric wards and were developing strategies for managing a novel illness with a poorly understood clinical course. Many psychiatrist expressed anxieties around their competency in assessing and managing acutely physically unwell patients in a mental health setting. This project aimed to improve confidence of psychiatrists in core physical health competencies through devising and delivering an evolving SBE package. Method Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust redeployed two higher trainees from their simulation faculty to work full time on developing a SBE package. This was requested by senior leadership to deliver training about assessing and managing physically unwell patients in the context of COVID-19. This training was devised as a 90 minute didactic lecture following by 90 minutes of SBE. This was delivered at 6 sites through 10 opt-in sessions available to all doctors in the trust over 4 weeks. Pre and post-course questionnaires were given to all participants to measure the effect. Result 102 medical staff attended the SBE workshops. Feedback was completed by 93 (91%) doctors prior to the course and 97 (95%) post. Before the workshop, 33% did not feel they had a structured approach for assessing an acutely unwell patient, which reduced to 0% after completing the course. On a 5-point Likert scale, confidence in managing COVID-19 symptoms increased from 2.54/5 to 4.07/5 overall with 89% of doctors feeling confident or very confident. There were similar increases in confidence in managing critically unwell patients (2.7/5 pre;3.95/5 post) and in identifying alternative causes for acutely unwell patients (2.63/5 pre;4.02/5 post).

As a result, some of these drugs have proved to be not only ineffective but also harmful because of adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions (DDIs). OBJECTIVE: To identify DDIs that led to adverse clinical outcomes and/or adverse drug reactions in patients with COVID-19 by systematically reviewing the literature and assessing the value of drug interaction checkers in identifying such events. EVIDENCE REVIEW: After identification of the drugs used during the COVID-19 pandemic, the drug interaction checkers Drugs.com, COVID-19 Drug Interactions, LexiComp, Medscape, and WebMD were consulted to analyze theoretical DDI-associated adverse events in patients with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2022. A systematic literature review was performed by searching the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane for articles published from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2022, to retrieve articles describing actual adverse events associated with DDIs. The drug interaction checkers were consulted again to evaluate their potential to assess such events. FINDINGS: The DDIs identified in the reviewed articles involved 46 different drugs. In total, 575 DDIs for 58 drug pairs (305 associated with at least 1 adverse drug reaction) were reported. The drugs most involved in DDIs were lopinavir and ritonavir. Of the 6917 identified studies, 20 met the inclusion criteria. These studies, which enrolled 1297 patients overall, reported 115 DDI-related adverse events: 15 (26%) were identifiable by all tools analyzed, 29 (50%) were identifiable by at least 1 of them, and 14 (24%) remained nonidentifiable. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The main finding of this systematic review is that the use of drug interaction checkers could have identified several DDI-associated adverse drug reactions, including severe and life-threatening events. Both the interactions between the drugs used to treat COVID-19 and between the COVID-19 drugs and those already used by the patients should be evaluated.","output":"Identification of Drug Interaction Adverse Events in Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: No prophylactic treatments for COVID-19 have been clearly proven and found. In this pandemic context, cancer patients constitute a particularly fragile population that would benefit the best from such treatments, a present unmet need. TMPRSS2 is essential for COVID-19 replication cycle and it is under androgen control. Estrogen and androgen receptor dependent cues converge on TMPRSS2 regulation through different mechanisms of action that can be blocked by the use of hormonal therapies. We believe that there is enough body of evidence to foresee a prophylactic use of hormonal therapies against COVID-19 and this hypothesis can be easily tested on cohorts of breast and prostate cancer patients who follow those regimens. In case of pandemic, if the protective effect of hormonal therapies will be proven on cancer patients, the use of specific hormonal therapies could be extended to other oncological groups and to healthy individuals to decrease the overall risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Given the COVID-19 coronavirus emergency, a special focus is needed on the impact of this rapidly spreading viral infection on cancer patients. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) regulation is emerging as an important determinant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility. In our study, we analyzed AR and TMPRSS2 expression in 17,352 normal and 9,556 cancer tissues from public repositories and stratified data according to sex and age. The emerging picture is that some patient groups may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may benefit from antiandrogen- or tamoxifen-based therapies. These findings are relevant to choose proper treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and put forward the idea that hormonal therapies could be used as prophylactic agents against COVID-19.","output":"Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Inhibitors: Unexpected Allies in the Fight Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background National epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections are being driven by: the degree of recent indoor mixing (both social and workplace), vaccine coverage, intrinsic properties of the circulating lineages, and prior history of infection (via natural immunity). In England, infections, hospitalisations and deaths fell during the first two steps of the 'roadmap' for exiting the third national lockdown. The third step of the roadmap in England takes place on 17 May 2021. Methods We report the most recent findings on community infections from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a swab is obtained from a representative cross-sectional sample of the population in England and tested using PCR. Round 11 of REACT-1 commenced self-administered swab-collection on 15 April 2021 and completed collections on 3 May 2021. We compare the results of REACT-1 round 11 to round 10, in which swabs were collected from 11 to 30 March 2021. Results Between rounds 10 and 11, prevalence of swab-positivity dropped by 50% in England from 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) to 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%), with a corresponding R estimate of 0.90 (0.87, 0.94). Rates of swab-positivity fell in the 55 to 64 year old group from 0.17% (0.12%, 0.25%) in round 10 to 0.06% (0.04%, 0.11%) in round 11. Prevalence in round 11 was higher in the 25 to 34 year old group at 0.21% (0.12%, 0.38%) than in the 55 to 64 year olds and also higher in participants of Asian ethnicity at 0.31% (0.16%, 0.60%) compared with white participants at 0.09% (0.07%, 0.11%). Based on sequence data for positive samples for which a lineage could be identified, we estimate that 92.3% (75.9%, 97.9%, n=24) of infections were from the B.1.1.7 lineage compared to 7.7% (2.1%, 24.1%, n=2) from the B.1.617.2 lineage. Both samples from the B.1.617.2 lineage were detected in London from participants not reporting travel in the previous two weeks. Also, allowing for suitable lag periods, the prior close alignment between prevalence of infections and hospitalisations and deaths nationally has diverged. Discussion We observed marked reductions in prevalence from March to April and early May 2021 in England reflecting the success of the vaccination programme and despite easing of restrictions during lockdown.

The lockdown measures taken worldwide in 2020 to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV- 2 virus can be envisioned as a policy intervention with an indirect effect on air quality. In this paper we propose a statistical spatio-temporal model as a tool for intervention analysis, able to take into account the effect of weather and other confounding factors, as well as the spatial and temporal correlation existing in the data. In particular, we focus here on the 2019/2020 relative change in nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations in the north of Italy, for the period of March and April during which the lockdown measure was in force. As an output, we provide a collection of weekly continuous maps, describing the spatial pattern of the NO$_2$ 2019/2020 relative changes. We found that during March and April 2020 most of the studied area is characterized by negative relative changes (median values around -25%), with the exception of the first week of March and the fourth week of April (median values around 5%). As these changes cannot be attributed to a weather effect, it is likely that they are a byproduct of the lockdown measures.","output":"A spatio-temporal analysis of NO$_2$ concentrations during the Italian 2020 COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) remains a concern among untreated HIV patients, notably of African descent, as patients can reach end-stage renal disease within three years. Two variants (G1 and G2) of the APOL1 gene, common in African populations to protect against African sleeping sickness, have been associated with an increased risk of several glomerular disorders including HIVAN, hypertension-attributed chronic kidney disease, idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and are accordingly named renal risk variants (RRVs). This review examines the mechanisms by which APOL1 RRVs drive glomerular injury in the setting of HIV infection and their potential application to patient management. Innate antiviral mechanisms activated by chronic HIV infection, especially those involving type 1 interferons, are of particular interest as they have been shown to upregulate APOL1 expression. Additionally, the downregulation of miRNA 193a (a repressor of APOL1) is also associated with the up-regulation of APOL1. Interestingly, glomerular damage affected by APOL1 RRVs is caused by both loss and gain of function changes in the protein, explicitly characterizing these effects. Their intracellular localization offers a further understanding of the nuances of APOL1 variants effects in promoting renal disease. Finally, although APOL1 variants have been recognized as a critical genetic player in mediating kidney disease, there are significant gaps in their application to patient management for screening, diagnosis, and treatment.","output":"APOL1 risk variants and the development of HIV Associated Nephropathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Archivos Espa?oles de Urologa finaliza el a?o 2020, un a?o difcil que todos recordaremos con tristeza como el a?o del Covid, editando un Nmero Monogrfico que es pura Ciencia y Novedad ,y que tambin tendr un largo recorrido en la Memoria de cuantos lo estudien o lo lean, titulado: NUEVOS PARADIGMAS EN EL CNCER VESICAL La importancia y relevancia del Tema seleccionado es y ser notoria en tanto podemos afirmar con toda seguridad que durante 2021 y siguientes a?os, los artculos contenidos en el mismo, sern motivo de referencia, presentaciones, ponencias y debates en todos los foros nacionales e internacionales en los que se aborde el manejo y tratamiento del Cncer Vesical...","output":"[Editorial: El cncer vesical, un tumor urolgico.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measurement of anthropometric indices can be used to promote early prevention of Diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Filipino population.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study including coronavirus disease 2019 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection between February 15, 2020, and November 30, 2020, according to age and type of organ support therapies. SETTING: About 168 hospitals in 16 countries within the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry. PATIENTS: Adult hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who did and did not require various types and combinations of organ support (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home with or without assistance and hospital length of stay. Risk-adjusted variation in hospital mortality for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was assessed by using multilevel models with hospitals as a random effect, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities. Among 20,608 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, the mean ( sd) age was 60.5 (17), 11,1887 (54.3%) were men, 8,745 (42.4%) were admitted to the ICU, and 3,906 (19%) died in the hospital. Hospital mortality was 8.2% for patients receiving no organ support (n = 15,001). The most common organ support therapy was invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5,005; 24.3%), with a hospital mortality of 49.8%. Mortality ranged from 40.8% among patients receiving only invasive mechanical ventilation (n =1,749) to 71.6% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and new renal replacement therapy (n = 655). Mortality was 39% for patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 389). Rates of discharge home ranged from 73.5% for patients who did not require organ support therapies to 29.8% for patients who only received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8.8% for invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement; 10.8% of patients older than 74 years who received invasive mechanical ventilation were discharged home. Median hospital length of stay for patients on mechanical ventilation was 17.1 days (9.7-28 d). Adjusted interhospital variation in mortality among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was large (median odds ratio 1.69). CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 prognosis varies by age and level of organ support. Interhospital variation in mortality of mechanically ventilated patients was not explained by patient characteristics and requires further evaluation.","output":"Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Receiving Organ Support Therapies: The International Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA) can improve physical, mental, and social health, leading to quality of life (QoL).

Materials and Methods: This systematic review was carried out based on the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Three databases were analyzed (Pubmed, Web of science and Scopus) by three independent researchers. From the 18 identified studies, 10 of them met the inclusion criteria. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 or its entry factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS), and furin) was analyzed in these 10 studies during the pandemic. Results: ACE2 expression was analyzed in 9 of the 10 studies. ACE2 is expressed mainly in the tongue, oral mucosa, salivary glands and epithelial cells. The expression of the TMPRSS2 gene or protein was analyzed in 6 studies. These studies reported that the expression of TMPRSS2 was mainly in the salivary glands, tongue, sulcular epithelium and oral mucosa; as well as in cells of the salivary glands (ductal, acinar and myoepithelial cells) and the tongue (the spinous-based cell layer, horny layer and the epithelial surface). Other TMPRSS were also reported. The expression of TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS5, TMPRSS7 and TMPRSS11D was reported mainly in salivary glands and in epithelial-type cells. Furan expression was analyzed in three studies. The expression of furin was detected mainly in epithelial cells of the tongue. A variety of methods were used to carry out the detection of SARS-CoV-2 or its input molecules. Conclusions: These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide variety of oral tissues and cells, and that together with the theories dedicated to explaining the oral symptoms present in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, it provides us with a good scientific basis for understanding the virus infection in the oral cavity and its consequences.","output":"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Entry Factors in Oral Tissues and Cells: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present work, an unsteady convection flow of Casson fluid, together with an oscillating vertical plate, is examined.

The ordinary derivative model generalized to fractional model is based on a generalized Fourier law. The solutions for energy and velocity equations are obtained after making the equations dimensionless. To check the insight of the physical parameters, especially the symmetric behavior of fractional parameters, it is found that for small and large values of time, fluid properties show dual behavior. Since the fractional derivative exhibits the memory of the function at the chosen value of time, therefore the present fractional model is more suitable in exhibiting memory than the classical model. Such results can be useful in the fitting of real data where needed. In the limiting case when fractional parameters are taken = = 0 and  = 1 for both velocity and temperature, we get the solutions obtained with ordinary derivatives from the existing literature.","output":"A Prabhakar Fractional Approach for the Convection Flow of Casson Fluid across an Oscillating Surface Based on the Generalized Fourier Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the period 1973C1998, among 2 139 allograft recipients treated with standard immunosuppression, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) developed in 19 patients (0.9 %): one plasmacytic hyperplasia, two polymorphic PTLD, one myeloma, and 15 lymphomas.

No data are available on costs and therapeutic classes of unused medicines in Italy.Objective: Conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of unused medicines returned for disposal to selected pharmacies in Rome, Italy, as well as to estimate the related costs for the NHS. Methods Medicines returned to 4 pharmacies were collected for 8 months. Therapeutic class, number of remaining dosage units, remaining validity, and reimbursement by the NHS were analysed. The cost of reimbursed medicines was estimated on the prices provided by the Italian regulatory agency (AIFA). Results The study sample consisted of 3219 medicine packages containing remaining dosage units, of which 72.4% had expired while 27.6% had not. The average remaining validity of unexpired medicines was 13 months. Medicines reimbursed by the NHS accounted for 73% of the total. Cardiovascular drugs and anti-infectives were the main therapeutic classes (17.2% and 15.2% of total packages, respectively), followed by gastrointestinal drugs, central nervous system (CNS) drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids. The average of remaining dosage units found in the examined packages was 68% of the initial number of units. In terms of cost, antibiotics were the most relevant therapeutic class, followed by cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs. The estimated cost for the Italian NHS was  200,656,780 per year. Conclusion Waste medicines constitute a significant, but reducible cost for the NHS. The high prevalence of anti-infectives in the study sample appears to be a distinctive Italian characteristic and may be due to inappropriate prescribing.

One model is developed to interpret the fast-growth phase of the epidemic and another model for an interpretation of the entire data set. Both models agree reasonably with the data. It is shown by the first model that during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases depends on the total number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82.

Subsequently, the granules containing ASP are converted to spherules and then to Ethyl cellulose (EC) Coated spherules (CS) by a novel bed coating during the rolling (BCDR) process. Among spherules, one with 0.35 mm than 0.71 mm shows required properties. The CS has a low 120(0) angle by Optical Microscopy (OM), smooth surface without cracks by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and better flow properties (Angle of repose 29.69  0.78(0), Carr's index 6.73  2.24%, Hausner's Ratio 1.07  0.03) than granules and spherules. Once certain structure-dependent control over release is attained (EC coated spherules shows 10% reduction in burst release (BR) than uncoated spherules showing a release of 80C91%) the predictability is achieved and Design of space (DOS) by DOE (CE-70.14%and CPC-200% and DR-61.54%) is established. The results of DOE to experimentally validated results were within 20% deviation. The aspirin is changing its crystal structure by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from Form-I to Form-II showing polymorphism inside the drug reservoir with respect to the process.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study that was conducted in Mexico. METHODS: Data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The risk of severe disease was 14.7%, and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RRper year = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely, obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38]), and previous severe laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39).

OBJECTIVE: The nature of potential interactions between these risk factors was the subject of this study. METHODS: A community-based cohort of 198 children at high atopic risk was followed from birth to 5 years. All episodes of acute respiratory illness in the first year were recorded and postnasal aspirates were collected for viral identification. History of wheeze and asthma was collected annually, and atopy was assessed at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years. RESULTS: A total of 815 episodes of acute respiratory illness were reported, and 33% were LRIs. Viruses were detected in 69% of aspirates, most commonly rhinoviruses (48.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (10.9%). At 5 years, 28.3%(n = 56) had current wheeze, and this was associated with wheezy [odds ratio (OR), 3.4 (1.2-9.7); P = .02] and/or febrile LRI [OR, 3.9 (1.4-10.5); P = .007], in particular those caused by respiratory syncytial virus or rhinoviruses [OR, 4.1 (1.3-12.6); P = .02]. Comparable findings were made for current asthma. Strikingly these associations were restricted to children who displayed early sensitization (2 years old) and not observed in nonatopic patients or those sensitized later. CONCLUSION: These data suggest viral infections interact with atopy in infancy to promote later asthma. Notably the occurrence of both of these events during this narrow developmental window is associated with maximal risk for subsequent asthma, which suggests a contribution from both classes of inflammatory insults to disease pathogenesis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Protection of high-risk children against the effects of severe respiratory infections during infancy may represent an effective strategy for primary asthma prevention. The potential benefits of these strategies merit more careful evaluation in this age group.","output":"Early-life respiratory viral infections, atopic sensitization, and risk of subsequent development of persistent asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transport-induced-charge (TIC) phenomena, in which the concentration imbalance between cations and anions occurs when more than two chemical potential gradients coexist within an ultrathin dimension, entail numerous nanofluidic systems. Evidence has indicated that the presence of TIC produces a nonlinear response of electroosmotic flow to the applied voltage, resulting in complex fluid behavior. In this study, we theoretically investigate thermal effects due to Joule heating on TIC phenomena in an ultrathin nanopore by computational fluid dynamics simulation. Our modeling results show that the rise of local temperature inside the nanopore significantly enhances TIC effects and thus has a significant influence on electroosmotic behavior. A local maximum of the solution conductivity occurs near the entrance of the nanopore at the high salt concentration end, resulting in a reversal of TIC across the nanopore. The Joule heating effects increase the reversal of TIC with the synergy of the negatively charged nanopore, and they also enhance the electroosmotic flow regardless of whether the nanopore is charged. These theoretical observations will improve our knowledge of nonclassical electrokinetic phenomena for flow control in nanopore systems.","output":"Joule Heating Effects on Transport-Induced-Charge Phenomena in an Ultrathin Nanopore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article illustrates how the Yamal-Nenets, a group of reindeer pastoralists in West Siberia, perceive a series of recent natural disasters to be connected to one another through a conspiracy C i.e. caused by the agency of malevolent human forces which are beyond the pastoralists control.

Among these patients, 16 cases were connected with clusters (11 family-cluster cases and 5 public-cluster cases). The basic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and epidemiological characteristics of the patients were considered in the investigation. RESULTS: The median age of the 18 patients was 44.5 years (37.5-52.0 years), and there were 10 males and 8 females in the sample. The main clinical symptoms were fever and cough. The epidemiological characteristics were as follows: (1) the median incubation period was 8 days (with an interquartile range of 4-12 days); (2) the incubation period in one case was &#8805;18 days; (3) one infant patient was asymptomatic prior to their diagnosis; and (4) two asymptomatic patients had a positive nucleic acid test after their family members were diagnosed with COVID-19.

Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19-convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) double-positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery.

Conclusions In this prospective study in patients with IBD stratified according to treatment all patients mounted serologic response to two doses of BNT162b2. However, its magnitude was significantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNF, regardless of administration timing and drug levels. Vaccine was safe. As vaccine serologic response longevity in this group may be limited, vaccine booster dose should be considered.","output":"Lower Serologic Response to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Treated with Anti-TNF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To demonstrate the accuracy and reproducibility of low-dose submillisievert chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in emergency room (ER) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study. From March 14(th) to March 24(th) 2020, 192 ER patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection were studied with low-dose chest CT and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Image analysis included likelihood of COVID-19 infection and semi-quantitative extent of lung involvement. CT images were analyzed by 2 radiologists blinded to RT-PCR results. Reproducibility was assessed with McNemar test and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Time between CT acquisition and report was measured. RESULTS: When compared to RT-PCR, low-dose submillisievert chest CT demonstrated excellent sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for diagnosis of COVID-19 (86.7%, 93.6%, 91.1%, 90.3%, and 90.2%, respectively), in particular in patients with clinical symptoms for >48h (95.6%, 93.2%, 91.5%, 96.5%, and 94.4%, respectively). In patients with a positive CT, likelihood of disease increased from 43.2% (pre-test probability) to 91.1% or 91.4% (post-test probability), while in patients with a negative CT, likelihood of disease decreased to 9.6% or 3.7% for all patients or those with clinical symptoms for >48h, respectively. The prevalence of alternative diagnoses based on chest CT in patients without COVID-19 infection was 17.6%. Mean effective radiation dose was 0.560.25 mSv (SD). Median time between CT acquisition and report was 25 minutes (IQR: 13-49 minutes). Intra- and interreader reproducibility of CT was excellent (all ICC0.95) without significant bias in Bland-Altman analysis. CONCLUSION: Low-dose submillisievert chest CT allows for rapid, accurate and reproducible assessment of COVID-19 infection in ER patients, in particular in patients with symptoms lasting longer than 48 hours. Chest CT has the additional advantage of offering alternative diagnoses in a significant subset of patients.","output":"Accuracy and reproducibility of low-dose submillisievert chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The drug supply chain has suffered many interruptions over the past decade. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated an already fragile infrastructure for supplying critical medications to hospitals and health-systems. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight to the history, thought-processes, and response to critical medication shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on hydromorphone infusions and the action steps taken to engage in non-sterile to sterile (NSTS) compounding. Over a period of 6 weeks, we compounded 1,613 NSTS hydromorphone infusion bags. All lots were cleared for sterility, particulate, potency, and endotoxin testing by an outside FDA registered laboratory. We did not have any safety reports filed specific to the NSTS compounded hydromorphone infusion bags. Over a period of 15 weeks, 715 infusions were consumed. The drug supply chain suffers frequent interruptions and critical shortages, particularly in times of a natural disaster or a global pandemic. Non-sterile to sterile compounding is often associated with risks of inaccuracies, impurities, and contamination. There are instances in which non-sterile to sterile compounding is appropriate and should be considered in times of drug shortages to support the care of hospitalized patients.","output":"Non-Sterile to Sterile Compounding: An Unconventional Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely advertised as helpful for chronic pain management but research is limited. Using a cross-sectional, anonymous survey, we examined patterns of naturalistic CBD use among individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) and other chronic pain conditions. Our objective was to better understand rates of CBD use, reasons for use and discontinuation, communication with healthcare professionals about CBD, and perceptions of CBD effectiveness and safety among people with FM. After excluding incomplete surveys, our study population consisted of N = 2701 participants with fibromyalgia, primarily in the United States. Overall, 38.1% reported never using CBD, 29.4% reported past CBD use, and 32.4% reported current CBD use. Past-year cannabis use was strongly associated with past or current CBD use. Those using CBD typically did so due to inadequate symptom relief, while those not using CBD typically cited safety concerns as their reason for not using CBD. Two-thirds of participants disclosed CBD use to their physician, although only 33% asked for physician advice on using CBD. Participants used CBD for numerous FM-related symptoms (most commonly pain), and generally reported slight to much improvement across symptom domains. Around half of participants reported side effects, which were typically minor. Our findings are limited by selection bias and our cross-sectional design, which prevents causal associations. In conclusion, CBD use is common among individuals with FM and many individuals using CBD report improvements across numerous FM-related symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for additional rigorous studies to better understand CBD's potential for FM management. Perspective: This article indicates that that CBD use is common among people with fibromyalgia, and the results suggest that many derive benefit from using CBD across multiple symptoms domains. Clinicians should discuss CBD use with fibromyalgia patients, and future studies are needed to rigorously assess CBD's therapeutic value for fibromyalgia symptoms.","output":"Cannabidiol Use for Fibromyalgia: Prevalence of Use and Perceptions of Effectiveness in a Large Online Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its public health control measures have led to worldwide interruptions in healthcare service delivery, and cancer services are no exception.

The high nutrient demand during pregnancy exacerbates the condition. To meet the increased nutritional demand, supplementation of iron and folic acid (IFA) is key. The supplements are provided freely to pregnant women during antenatal visits at public health facilities, however, their uptake and adherence in Kenya remain unacceptably low. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 241 postnatal mothers seeking maternal and child healthcare (MCH) care at Kakamega level 5 hospital was conducted. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data were collected from 241 eligible postnatal mothers, while qualitative data were obtained through key informant interviews with community health volunteers and healthcare providers. Results: There was a moderate adherence to IFA supplementation (60.6%) during pregnancy among postnatal mothers seeking MCH care at Kakamega level 5 hospital. Some of the reasons for non-adherence stated by the respondents included; IFA related side effects (41.3%), forgetfulness (37.3%) and bad smell of the IFA supplements (10.3%). Higher IFA adherence was noted among the primigravida participants (OR=2.704; 95% CI: 1.262, 5.793; p=0.010) compared to multigravida participants, and those with a higher knowledge level of anaemia (OR=3.215; 95% CI: 1.346, 7.68; p=0.009) compared to their counterparts with low anaemia knowledge. Other factors that showed correlation with IFA adherence were: IFA education, pregnancy counselling before conception and the number of antenatal care visits attained. Conclusion: There is a moderate adherence to IFA supplementation during pregnancy among mothers seeking MCH at Kakamega level 5 hospital. The greatest impediments of IFA compliance during pregnancy are IFA side effects, forgetfulness and the bad smell of the IFA tablets. Therefore, providing IFA education to pregnant mothers incorporated with probable ways of managing the IFA side effects would contribute to IFA supplementation adherence.","output":"Adherence to iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy among postnatal mothers seeking maternal and child healthcare at Kakamega level 5 hospital in Kenya: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article on p. 993 in vol. 22, PMID: 27192395.].","output":"Correction: Vol. 22, No. 6."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating pandemic that has spread to many parts of the world.

Methods: This paper considers theories over the last 30 years that have impacted hygiene policy and consumer practice, from the Germ Theory of Disease and the Hygiene Hypothesis, to the Microbial Theory of Health, including the concept of Bidirectional Hygiene. Here we present a high-level review of the literature on pathogen transmission and the cycle of infection in the home and everyday settings. Results: Targeted hygiene is an evidence-based hygiene policy that is employed to prevent transmission of pathogens and the transmission of infectious diseases through targeting only sites, surfaces, and practices that are considered high risk for pathogen transmission. Targeted hygiene also discourages the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum microbicides for lower-risk activities and surfaces. Conclusions: The Microbial Theory of Health, including age-appropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life, should usher in a new era in which pathogen reduction can be accomplished without indiscriminate elimination of potentially beneficial microbes from the human and environmental microbiomes.","output":"A 21(st) century view of infection control in everyday settings: moving from the Germ Theory of Disease to the Microbial Theory of Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Top public health experts and organizations strongly recommend universal masking for children older than 2 years old during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, but speculate it may be difficult for young children.

Previous studies have suggested that CXCR4 reduces the pyroptosis of LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antipyroptosis effects and mechanisms of CXCR4 after SAH. SAH animal model was induced via endovascular perforation. A total of 136 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Recombinant human cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine ligand 12 (rh-CXCL-12) was administered intranasally at 1 h after SAH induction. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the inhibitor of CXCR4, AMD3100, was administered intraperitoneally at 1 h before SAH. The neurobehavior tests were assessed, followed by performing Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The Western blot results suggested that the expressions of endogenous CXCL-12, CXCR4, and NLRP1 were increased and peaked at 24 h following SAH. Immunofluorescence staining showed that CXCR4 was expressed on neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Rh-CXCL-12 treatment improved the neurological deficits and reduced the number of FJC-positive cells, IL-18-positive neurons, and cleaved caspase-1(CC-1)-positive neurons after SAH.

In this analysis, we use parametric time-to-event (PTTE) analysis to quantify the effects of midazolam in critically ill children. METHODS: In the PTTE analysis, data was analyzed from a published study in mechanically ventilated children in which blinded midazolam or placebo infusions were administered during a sedation interruption phase until, based on COMFORT-B and NISS scores, patients became undersedated and unblinded midazolam was restarted. Using NONMEM? v.7.4.3., restart of unblinded midazolam was analysed as event. Patients in the trial were divided into internal and external validation cohorts prior to analysis. RESULTS: Data contained 138 events from 79 individuals (37 blinded midazolam; 42 blinded placebo). In the PTTE model, the baseline hazard was best described by a constant function. Midazolam reduced the hazard for restart of unblinded midazolam due to undersedation by 51%. In the blinded midazolam group, time to midazolam restart was 26 h versus 58 h in patients with low versus high disease severity upon admission (PRISM II < 10 versus > 21), respectively. For blinded placebo, these times were 14 h and 33 h, respectively. The model performed well in an external validation with 42 individuals.

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150C200.

MATERIALS-METHODS Sixty-five caregivers of children with tracheostomy were included. First, participants were evaluated with written test about TC and participated in the practical tests. Then, they were asked to participate in a standardized training session, including theoretical and practical parts. Baseline and post-intervention assessments were compared through written and practical tests conducted on the same day. RESULTS A significant improvement was observed in the written test score after the training. The median number of correct answers of the written test including 23 questions increased 26%, from 12 to 18 (p<0.001).

The objectives of this study were to identify clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters that could differentiate between influenza and COVID-19 and to assess the frequency and impact of early bacterial co-infection. A prospective observational cohort study was performed between February 2019 and April 2020. A retrospective cohort was studied early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients suspected of sepsis with PCR-confirmed influenza or SARS-CoV-2 were included. A multivariable logistic regression model was built to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. In total, 103 patients tested positive for influenza and 110 patients for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Hypertension (OR 6.550), both unilateral (OR 4.764) and bilateral (OR 7.916), chest X-ray abnormalities, lower temperature (OR 0.535), lower absolute leukocyte count (OR 0.857), lower AST levels (OR 0.946), higher LDH (OR 1.008), higher ALT (OR 1.044) and higher ferritin (OR 1.001) were predictive of COVID-19.

This public health emergency was followed by a significant loss of human life; the ensuing social restrictions led to loss of employment, lack of interactions, and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens' mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making. This study exploited AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviors in global emergencies, which could lead to improved planning and policy making for future crises.","output":"Emotions of COVID-19: Content Analysis of Self-Reported Information Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Disruption of education can lead to drastic changes and therefore, we need to maximize the benefits of e-technology.

These inhibitors are commonly used to alter the cell surface glycosylation. However, structural analysis of the released glycans has been limited. In this research, the cell membranes were enriched and the glycans were released to obtain the N-glycans of the glycocalyx. Glycomic analysis using liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry (LCCMS) with a PGC chip column was used to profile the structures in the cell membrane. Glycans of untreated cells were compared to glycans of cells treated with inhibitors, including kifunensine, which inhibits the formation of complex- and hybrid-type structures, 2,4,7,8,9-Penta-O-acetyl-N-acetyl-3-fluoro-b-d-neuraminic acid methyl ester for sialylated glycans, 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucose, and 6-alkynyl fucose for fucosylated glycans. Kifunensine was the most effective, converting nearly 95% of glycans to high mannose types. The compound 6-alkynyl fucose inhibited some fucosylation but also incorporated into the glycan structure. Proteomic analysis of the enriched membrane for the four inhibitors showed only small changes in the proteome accompanied by large changes in the N-glycome for Caco-2.

Temperature, then matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T(90) (time required for 1 log(10) reduction) for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T(90) for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37?C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 in untreated wastewater, 5.58 to 43.1 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 10.9 to 43.9 days in tap water.

This study aimed to assess the association between core air pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. Data on air pollutant levels (particulate matter [PM(2.5), PM(10)], ozone [O(3)], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO(2)], sulphur dioxide [SO(2)], pollutant standard index [PSI]) and meteorological factors (rainfall, humidity, temperature) was obtained from the Singapore National Environmental Agency (NEA) from 23 January 2020 to 6 April 2020.

Last summer, two patients with C. Auris infections were admitted at University of Chicago Medicine (UCM). Environmental samples were collected to assess environmental contamination before and after cleaning. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected using 3M Sponge Sticks with neutralizing Buffer during one patient?s stay, weeks after another patient?s stay, and after enhanced terminal cleaning. Samples were cultured directly and yeast was identified using MALDI. The following surfaces were sampled: Bathroom sink drain, bedside table, bedrail, mattress, chair and window ledge. Routine terminal cleaning includes 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied high touch surfaces of both room and bathroom. The enhanced terminal cleaning process used for these rooms included: (1) 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied to all high touch surfaces and walls; (2) privacy curtains removed and replaced; (3) supervision by environmental services manager; and (4) single UV disinfection cycle in room and bathroom. RESULTS: Because of delay in identification of C auris for the first patient, pre-clean samples were taken >2 weeks after the patient had been discharged. During the intervening weeks, multiple patients had occupied the room and there had been >3 routine terminal cleanings. None of these samples were positive for C auris. Pre-clean, in-residence samples indicated C auris contamination of multiple surfaces for the second patient. Because of transfers within the institution, there are three sets of post-cleaning cultures for the second patient. All post-clean environmental cultures were negative for both patients.

In this case series, we describe the anatomy and frequency of radial artery loops and provide a technique for successful navigation of this anatomic anomaly. METHODS We reviewed our database of radial diagnostic or interventional neuroangiographic procedures to identify cases in which a radial loop was encountered during the procedure. The loop pattern, the presence of an associated recurrent radial artery branch, navigation technique, and procedure-related complications were recorded. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 997 transradial approach procedures were performed over a 9-month period. A radial loop was identified in 10 (1.0%) patients. The average age was 68.6  14.3 years. A microcatheter advanced over a microwire was used to navigate the loop and avoid entry into the recurrent branch. A diagnostic neuroangiographic procedure was performed successfully in 8 cases and an intervention was performed successfully in 1 case. A 360 loop was present in 2 of these cases. In each case, transradial access was performed successfully. In 1 other diagnostic case, transradial access was aborted, and the femoral artery was accessed to perform the procedure. CONCLUSIONS A radial loop was present in 1% of the cases in this series.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multicenter study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the quadripartite equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium-sized liver transplant centers from 12 countries across 4 continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a \\"sickest-first\\" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - recipient outcome, donor/graft safety, waiting list mortality and healthcare resources - for 7 countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems.

The study found that: traditional medicines are widely used in Qokolweni due to accessibility and long-built trust; the practice is broad and not certified. To achieve the integration of traditional medicine into the conventional health systems, the central government needs to show political will by setting up regulatory strategies that provide for the scientific evaluation and certification of traditional medicines. This will build confidence among biomedical scientists and health practitioners, thereby fostering easy collaboration and integration.","output":"Utilization of traditional medicine and its integration into the healthcare system in Qokolweni, South Africa; prospects for enhanced universal health coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Kidney disease and cardiovascular disease seem to be lethally synergistic and both are approaching the epidemic level. A reduced glomerular filtration rate is associated with increased mortality risk in patients with heart failure. Many patients with congestive heart failure are anemic. Anemia is very often associated with chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVES To assess--in relation to New York Heart Association class--the prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease in patients with normal serum creatinine in a cohort of 526 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. METHODS GFR was estimated using the simplified MDRD formula, the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the Jeliffe and the novel CKD-EPI formula. RESULTS According to the WHO definition the prevalence of anemia in our study was 21%. We observed a progressive decline in GFR and hemoglobin concentration together with a rise in NYHA class. Significant correlations were observed between eGFR and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, age, NYHA class, complications of PCI, including bleeding, and major adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease is high in patients undergoing PCI despite normal serum creatinine, particularly in higher NYHA class. Lower eGFR and hemoglobin are associated with more complications, including bleeding after PCI and higher prevalence of major adverse cardiac events. In patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, GFR should be estimated since renal dysfunction and subsequent anemia are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","output":"Prevalence of chronic kidney disease and anemia in patients with coronary artery disease with normal serum creatinine undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions: relation to New York Heart Association class."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care testing for pathogens is crucial for disease control. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been employed for nucleic acid detection, but they have limited sensitivity and specificity. Here, we used a fusion of catalytically inactive SpCas9 endonuclease and VirD2 relaxase for sensitive, specific nucleic acid detection by LFA. In this assay, the target nucleic acid is amplified with biotinylated oligos. VirD2-dCas9 specifically binds the target sequence via dCas9 and covalently binds to a FAM-tagged oligonucleotide via VirD2. The biotin label and FAM tag are detected by a commercially available LFA. We coupled this system, named Vigilant (VirD2-dCas9 guided and LFA-coupled nucleic acid test), to reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification to detect SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples. Vigilant exhibited a limit of detection of 2.5 copies/L, comparable to CRISPR-based systems, and showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV1 or MERS.

DESIGN The study analysed cross-sectional and nationally representative data from 2007 to 2014 Botswana STEPS Surveys and the 2017 Botswana Demographic Survey. SETTING Botswana. PARTICIPANTS Botswana adults aged 25-64 years (n=4003 in 2007, n=2983 in 2014 and n=11 550 in 2017). PRIMARY OUTCOME Underweight and overweight/obesity. RESULTS The prevalence of underweight decreased from 18.1% (95% CI 12.0% to 26.3%) in 2007 to 11.6% (95% CI 9.5% to 13.9%) in 2014 and further dropped to 8.1% (95% CI 7.5% to 8.8%) in 2017. The prevalence of overweight/obesity increased slightly from 37.4% (95% CI 34.3% to 40.7%) in 2007 to 38.6% (95% CI 35.9% to 41.3%) in 2014 to 47.3% (95% CI 46.1% to 48.4%) in 2017. Underweight was more prevalent among males than females while overweight and obesity were more prevalent among females than males. The key risk factor for underweight was being male (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.21: 95% CI 1.80 to 2.72 in 2007, AOR 1.54: 95% CI 1.06 to 2.22 in 2014 and AOR 1.51: 95% CI 1.45 to 1.58 in 2017). For overweight/obesity, the main risk factors were being female (male AOR 0.23: 95% CI 0.15 to 0.35 in 2007, AOR 0.32: 95% CI 0.25 to 0.42 in 2014 and AOR 0.30: 95% CI 0.29 to 0.31 in 2017), being old (AOR 2.18: 95% CI 1.58 to 3.01 in 2007, AOR 2.37: 95% CI 1.71 to 3.29 in 2014) and AOR 2.10: 95% CI 1.94 to 2.27 in 2017 among those aged 55-64 years) and not working (AOR 1.70: 95% CI 1.20 to 2.42 in 2007, AOR 2.05: 95% CI 1.55 to 2.69 in 2014 and AOR 1.34: 95% CI 1.27 to 1.40 in 2017). CONCLUSIONS The findings presented in this study indicate coexistence of the double burden of underweight and overweight/obesity among adults aged 25-64 years in Botswana. Although underweight prevalence is on the decline, overweight/obesity is increasing over time.

In the landing phase, information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a camera, ultrawideband (UWB) devices, and the drones software estimation are merged by utilizing an extended Kalman filter algorithm to improve the landing precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the transported parcel.

These products are fragile and typically require cold chain for their delivery and storage. Delivering biologics, while maintaining the cold chain, whether standard (2C to 8C) or deepfreeze (as cold as -70C), requires extensive infrastructure that is expensive to build and maintain. This poses a huge challenge to equitable healthcare delivery, especially during a global pandemic. Even when the infrastructure is in place, breaches of the cold chain are common. Such breaches may damage the product, making therapeutics and vaccines ineffective or even harmful. Rather than strengthening the cold chain through building more infrastructure and imposing more stringent guidelines, we suggest that money and effort are best spent on making the cold chain unnecessary for biologics delivery and storage. To meet this grand challenge in pharmaceutical research, we highlight areas where innovations are needed in the design, formulation and biomanufacturing of biologics, including point-of-care manufacturing and inspection.

As health is one of the leading service sectors of the North Cyprus economy, analysing patients perceived value of healthcare service quality is crucial. In this research, a comparative analysis of existing models revealed affordability, acceptability and accessibility as the leading modern service quality indicators affecting patients perceived value of healthcare service quality. The quality of services is a leading factor impacting business competition and retention dictated by the current market. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence patient perceptions of healthcare service quality in North Cyprus. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was carried out among 388 patients of public and private hospitals in North Cyprus, and the data were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Empirical results highlight that the acceptability of healthcare services is a prerequisite for perceiving a high value of service quality. The affordability and accessibility of services, respectively, were less effective. Results concerning mediating effects confirm that acceptability could fully mediate the relationship between affordability and perceived value and could partially mediate the impact of accessibility on the perceived quality of healthcare services.

We evaluated an outpatient asthma care package for children, including task-shifting of asthma management roles. METHODS: We conducted a non-blinded individually randomised controlled trial at a tertiary-level government hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Children aged 6C15 years diagnosed with asthma were recruited from outpatient clinic, stratified by Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) score and allocated 1:1 from a concealed file, accessed during electronic questionnaire completion. The intervention, delivered by non-physicians, comprised clinical assessment, optimisation of inhaled treatment, individualised asthma education. The control group received standard care from outpatient physicians. Primary outcome for intention-to-treat analysis was change in cACT score at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included asthma exacerbations requiring emergency healthcare and school absence. FINDINGS: Between September 2018 and December 2019, 120 children (59 intervention; 61 control) were recruited; 65.8% males, with mean (SD) age 9.8 (2.8) years, mean (SD) baseline cACT 20.3 (2.6). At 3 months, intervention children (n=56) had a greater mean (SD) change in cACT score from baseline (2.7 (2.8) vs 0.6 (2.8)) compared with standard care participants (n=59); a difference of 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.1 to 3.1, p<0.001). Fewer intervention children attended emergency healthcare (7.3% vs 25.4%, p=0.02) and missed school (20.0% vs 62.7%, p<0.001) compared with standard care children.

Much of the concern boils down to the question -- just how effective are face coverings? One means to address this question is to review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and coverings operate -- steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion and electrostatic capture. We enquire as to what extent these can be used to predict the efficacy of coverings. We combine the predictions of the models of these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter. Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton fabrics to show that three-layered cloth masks can be constructed with comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions. Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimise leakage.","output":"Efficacy of face coverings in reducing transmission of COVID-19: calculations based on models of droplet capture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused due to COVID-19, has seen things going online.

The characteristics of abdominal trauma patients with poor outcomes related to obesity require evaluation. We hypothesize that obesity is related to increased mortality and length of stay (LOS) among abdominal trauma patients undergoing laparotomies. METHODS: Abdominal trauma patients were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank between 2013 and 2015. Patients who received laparotomies were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate the mortality rate and LOS between obese and non-obese patients. Patients without laparotomies were analyzed as a control group using PSM cohort analysis. RESULTS: A total of 33,798 abdominal trauma patients were evaluated, 10,987 of them received laparotomies. Of these patients, the proportion of obesity in deceased patients was significantly higher when compared to the survivors (33.1% vs. 26.2%, p < 0.001). Elevation of one kg/m(2) of body mass index independently resulted in 2.5% increased odds of mortality. After a well-balanced PSM, obese patients undergoing laparotomies had significantly higher mortality rates [3.7% vs. 2.4%, standardized difference (SD) = 0.241], longer hospital LOS (11.1 vs. 9.6 days, SD = 0.135), and longer intensive care unit LOS (3.5 vs. 2.3 days, SD = 0.171) than non-obese patients undergoing laparotomies.

Furthermore, the aims of vaccination programmes will differ between countries, with some prioritising economic benefits that could stem from the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and others seeking simply to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths. This paper aims to share the experiences and lessons learned from conducting economic evaluations in Singapore and Thailand on hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines to provide a basis for other countries to develop their own contextualised economic evaluations, with particular focus on the key uncertainties, technical challenges, and characteristics that modellers should consider in partnership with key stakeholders.

Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12% of 383 complications). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations such as between cancer (risk ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3, p=0.04) with early-onset heart failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36 patients).

In the current situation, the virus is rapidly spreading worldwide, and the discovery of vaccine and potential therapeutics are critically essential. The crystal structure for main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) was recently made available and is considerably similar to previously reported SARS-CoV. Due to its essentiality in viral replication, it represents a potential drug target. Herein, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach was implemented for the initial screening of 13 approved antiviral drugs. Molecular docking of 13 antivirals against 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme was accomplished and indinavir was described as a lead drug with a docking score of -8.824 and a XP Gscore of -9.466 kcal/mol. Indinavir possesses an important pharmacophore, hydroxyethylamine (HEA), and thus a new library of HEA compounds (>2500) was subjected to virtual screening that led to 25 hits with a docking score more than indinavir. Exclusively, compound 16 with docking score of -8.955 adhered to drug like parameters, and the Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis was demonstrated to highlight the importance of chemical scaffolds therein. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies carried out at 100ns supported the stability of 16 within the binding pocket. Largly, our results supported that this novel compound 16 binds to the domain I & II, and domain II-III linker of 3CLpro protein, suggesting its suitablity as strong candidate for therapeutic discovery against COVID-19. Lead compound 16 could pave incredible directions for the design of novel 3CLpro inhibitors and ultimately therapeutics against COVID-19 disease.","output":"Discovery of New Hydroxyethylamine Analogs Against 3CLpro Protein Target of SARS-CoV-2: Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged since December 2019, in Wuhan, China However, electrocardiograhic (ECG) manifestations of patients with COVID-19 have not been fully described We aim to investigate ECG characteristics in COVID-19 patients and risk factors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission METHODS: This retrospective observational study included the patients with COVID-19 at the Wuhan Asia General hospital between February 10, and 26, 2020 Demographic, clinical, and ECG characteristics were collected, and comparisons were made between the ICU and non-ICU admission groups Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of ICU admission RESULTS: Among 135 included patients (median age: 64 years [interquartile range: 48-72]), ST-T abnormalities (40%) were the most common ECG feature, followed by arrhythmias (38%) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was presented in 48% of the patients Six (4 4%) died during hospitalization, and 23 (17 0%) were admitted to the ICU Compared with non-ICU group, the ICU group showed higher heart rate (p = 019) and P-wave duration (p = 039) and was more frequently associated with CVD (p &lt; 001), ST-T abnormalities (p = 007), arrhythmias (p = 003), QTc interval prolongation (p = 003), and pathological Q waves (p &lt; 001) Twenty-seven patients were re-examined ECG during admission, and 17 of them presented new findings compared with their initial ECG presentations ST-T abnormalities (p = 040) and history of CVD (p = 0047) were associated with increased risk of ICU hospitalization CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is frequently related to cardiovascular manifestations including ECG abnormalities and cardiovascular comorbidities ST-T abnormalities and CVD at admission were associated with increased odds of ICU admission","output":"Electrocardiograhic characteristics in patients with coronavirus infection: A single-center observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women in academic publishing and academic psychiatry face many challenges of gender inequality, including significant pay differentials, poor visibility in senior positions and a male-dominated hierarchical system.

SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions.

Following a finding of harmful alcohol use among 5-8-year-old children in Mbale District, Uganda, this study aims to investigate community members views on early childhood substance use among children below the age of 10 years. METHODS: In 2016, we conducted eight focus group discussions with 48 parents and 26 key informant interviews with teachers, health workers, alcohol distributors, traditional healers, religious leaders, community leaders and youth workers. We used thematic content analysis. Four participants and two research assistants reviewed and confirmed the findings. RESULTS: Alcohol in everyday life: Even children on laps taste alcohol: Almost all participants confirmed the existence of and concern for substance use before age 10. They described a context where substance use was widespread in the community, especially intake of local alcoholic brews. Children would access substances in the home or buy it themselves. Those living in poor neighbourhoods or slums and children of brewers were described as particularly exposed. Using substances to cope: We dont want them to drink: Participants explained that some used substances to cope with a lack of food and resources for childcare, as well as traumatic experiences. This made children in deprived families and street-connected children especially vulnerable to substance use. Participants believed this was a result of seeing no alternative solution. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the context and conditions of childhood substance use before age 10 in Mbale District, Uganda. The study shows that community members attributed early childhood substance use to a social context of widespread use in the community, which was exacerbated by conditions of material and emotional deprivation.

This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (<65%) and high (65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score.

The aim of this study was to identify to what extent voluntary participation in the 2019 initiative delivered training to the population with the highest need. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study of location characteristics for RSAH training events conducted by UK ambulance services. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse event and area characteristics. National cardiac arrest registry data were used to establish proportions of training coverage in hot spot areas with above national median incidence of cardiac arrest and below median bystander CPR rates. The significance of observed differences were tested using chi-square for proportions and t-test for means. RESULTS: Twelve of 14 UK ambulance services participated, training 236,318 people. Most of the events (82%) were held in schools, and schoolchildren comprised most participants (81%). RSAH events were held in areas that were less densely populated (p < 0.001), were more common in affluent areas (p < 0.001), and had a significantly lower proportion of black residents (p < 0.05) and higher proportion of white residents (p < 0.05).

Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies.

The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV. RESULTS: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/l (Ct value of 33.67  0.5) and 0.001 TCID(50)/ml (Ct value of 34.7  0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR.

It causes different pathological conditions in both males and females, ranging from benign pathologies up to cancers. The introduction of vaccination has certainly had a major impact in terms of reducing the incidence of both HPV infections and diseases but in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) there are still about more than 13,000 deaths due to cervical cancer each year. To date in Europe and in Italy there are three vaccines available (bi-, tetra-, and nonvalent vaccines). The vaccination campaign started irregularly in Europe and Italy in 2007, with pre-adolescent girls as the primary target. Later, other cohorts were introduced such as 12-year-old boys, additional cohorts of >25-year-old women, women who already underwent cervical surgery and other subjects entitled to free vaccination. The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly impacted on public health services, particularly on vaccinations that, especially during the first pandemic phase, have been often delayed and/or canceled. The most affected vaccinations by the pandemic have been the non-mandatory ones, particularly those addressing the adolescent and adult population, such as immunization against papillomavirus. To date the achievement of the coverage target set by the Italian National Immunization Plan (NIP) has not yet been achieved.

The importance of these changes is reflected in the loss of virus infectivity, the aggregation of virions, and increased virus-induced cell fusion at the same pH. Coronavirus (MHV-A59) infectivity is exquisitely sensitive to pH. The virus was quite stable at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C (half-life, approximately 24 h) but was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by brief treatment at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C (half-life, approximately 30 min). Virions treated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C formed clumps and large aggregates. With virions treated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C, the amino-terminal peptide E2N (or S1) was released from virions and the remaining peptide, E2C (S2), was aggregated. Viral spikes isolated from detergent-treated virions also aggregated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. Loss of virus infectivity and E2 (S) aggregation at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C were markedly enhanced in the presence of dithiothreitol. On the basis of the effects of dithiothreitol on the reactions of the peplomer, we propose that release of E2N (S1) and aggregation of E2C (S2) may be triggered by rearrangement of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The aggregation of virions and the isolated E2 (S) glycoprotein at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C or following treatment with guanidine and urea at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C indicate that an irreversible conformational change has been induced in the peplomer glycoprotein by these conditions. It is interesting that coronavirus-induced cell fusion also occurred under mildly alkaline conditions and at 37 degrees C. Some enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses and alphaviruses, show conformational changes of spike glycoproteins at a low pH, which correlates with fusion and penetration of those viruses in acidified endocytic vesicles. For coronavirus MHV-A59, comparable conformational change of the spike glycoprotein E2 (S) and cell fusion occurred at a mildly alkaline condition, suggesting that coronavirus infection-penetration, like that of paramyxoviruses and lentiviruses, may occur at the plasma membrane, rather than within endocytic vesicles.","output":"Conformational change of the coronavirus peplomer glycoprotein at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C correlates with virus aggregation and virus-induced cell fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been spreading all over the world and its diagnosis is attracting more research every moment.

The purpose of the present article is to review several issues of viral infection in CAP in light of recent studies that included exhaustive evaluation of viruses. RECENT FINDINGS The introduction of better quality diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, have markedly improved our ability to detect multiple viral pathogens. With these diagnostic tools, a viral cause can be established in more than half of patients with CAP. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are the most frequent causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and influenza. Although some clinical findings have been more frequent with viral infection, no clear-cut clinical signs have been shown to be predictive of specific cause. Of more interest is the association of mixed virus-bacteria infection with poorer severity scores found in some studies. The diagnostic approach with new techniques should be taken for a true estimation of viral infection in epidemiologic studies.Unfortunately, there are no other licensed antivirals or vaccines against the large variety of clinically important respiratory viruses with the notable exception of influenza. SUMMARY Given the high rate of viral infection in CAP and its probable association with poorer prognosis in mixed virus-bacteria infection, an extensive evaluation for virus in some populations seems appropriate. These findings can be useful for a more appropriate management of these patients.","output":"Viral pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This collection of research papers addresses fundamental questions concerning the nature of myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), the problem of disbelief and lack of knowledge and understanding of the condition among many doctors and the origins of this problem, and its impact on patients and their families.

Dental practices are a high-risk area for contracting coronavirus; this fact generates psychological disturbances amongst patients. In this study, we aimed to assess the levels of anxiety of patients while visiting dental practices before and after getting vaccinated. This cross-sectional study was carried out between March and December 2021. An electronic survey was distributed among the vaccinated individuals who visited dental clinics before and after getting vaccinated. The survey consisted of the following four parts: demographic characteristics, questions related to coronavirus, and anxiety scores before and after getting vaccinated. SPSS-25 was used to perform the statistical analysis, where paired t-test was used to compare the anxiety scores, and MannCWhitney U test to assess the association of gender with anxiety scores. A p-value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A total of 400 vaccinated individuals participated in this study, with a response rate of 88.23%. The majority of the respondents (71.0%) did not test positive for coronavirus. More than half of the participants (54.0%) reported to not be suffering from any coronavirus-related symptoms. About 100 (25.0%) of the individuals stated that dental clinics are an environment in which there is a high risk of contracting coronavirus. In regards to the comparison of the mean MDAS scores of the participants before and after getting vaccinated, a significant difference (p = 0.001) was found.

The aim was to assess the quality of sleep (QoS) and fatigue in patients with the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: The study included 67 patients with RRMS and 85 healthy control subjects. RRMS patients, who were tested in first half of 2019, were retested in April and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected sociodemographic and clinical data, and also used the following questionnaires: Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54). RESULTS: The FSS score and PSQI global score were significantly higher in patients with RRMS than in the control group (p < 0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results during the COVID-19 pandemic in PSQI global score (p < 0.01) and all subscores. Higher disability status was an independent predictor of the worse PSQI scores. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak worse QoS were noticed in RRMS patients than in healthy individuals. Also, QoS of RRMS patients is more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic than in regular circumstances. High levels of sleep disturbance and fatigue in RRMS patients correlates with worse life quality, female gender, lower educational level and partner status.

Previous research found that mental disorders are associated with several work-related outcomes such as loss of income, however, not much is known about how this varies with migrant background. This study investigated the change in work-related income following the uptake of outpatient mental healthcare (OPMH) treatment, a proxy for mental disorder, in young women with and without migrant background. Additionally, we looked at how the association varied by income level. Methods: Using data from four national registries, the study population consisted of women aged 23C40 years residing in Norway for at least three consecutive years between 2006 and 2013 (N = 640,527). By using a stratified linear regression with individual fixed effects, we investigated differences between majority women, descendants and eight migrant groups. Interaction analysis was conducted in order to examine differences in income loss following the uptake of OPMH treatment among women with and without migrant background. Results: Results showed that OPMH treatment was associated with a decrease in income for all groups. However, the negative effect was stronger among those with low income. Only migrant women from Western and EU Eastern Europe with a high income were not significantly affected following OPMH treatment. Conclusion: Experiencing a mental disorder during a critical age for establishment in the labor market can negatively affect not only income, but also future workforce participation, and increase dependency on social welfare services and other health outcomes, regardless of migrant background. Loss of income due to mental disorders can also affect future mental health, resulting in a vicious circle and contributing to more inequalities in the society.","output":"Change in Work-Related Income Following the Uptake of Treatment for Mental Disorders Among Young Migrant and Non-migrant Women in Norway: A National Register Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background While pediatric cases of COVID-19 are at low risk for adverse events, schoolchildren should be considered for surveillance as they can become infected at school and serve as sources of household or community transmission. Our team assessed the feasibility of young children self-collecting SARS-CoV-2 samples for surveillance testing in an educational setting. Methods Students at a K-8 school were tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2 from September 2020 - June 2021. Error rates were collected from September 2020 - January 2021. Clinical staff provided all students with instructions for anterior nares specimen self-collection and then observed them to ensure proper technique. Instructions included holding the sterile swab while making sure not to touch the tip, inserting the swab into their nostril until they start to feel resistance, and rubbing the swab in four circles before repeating the process in their other nostril. An independent observer timed random sample self-collections from April - June 2021. Results 2,590 samples were collected from 209 students during the study period when data on error rates were collected. Errors occurred in 3.3% of all student encounters (n=87). Error rates over time are shown in Figure 1, with the highest rate occurring on the first day of testing (n=20/197, 10.2%) and the lowest in January 2021 (n=1/202, 0.5%). 2,574 visits for sample self-collection occurred during the study period when independent timing data was collected (April - June 2021).

Since severe pathologic effects of infection occur with increasing age, COVID-19 falls under the geroscience concept that all diseases in older adults have a common and major underlying cause of declining function and resilience. Geroscience posits that manipulation of aging will simultaneously delay the appearance or severity of major diseases because they share the same risk factor: aging and the multiple processes involved in aging. Drug combinations that target multiple aging processes and the cytokine networks associated with them would not necessarily limit SARS-CoV-2 infection rates but would prevent severe pathologic consequences of the disease in older adults by maintaining a more youthful-like resilience to infection-related complications. A drug cocktail aimed at controlling cytokine actions would complement current clinical treatments and vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 and serve as a prototype for future age-related infectious disease pandemics wherein the elderly population is especially vulnerable.","output":"A Geroscience Approach to Preventing Pathologic Consequences of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study is the protocol for a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of herbal medicine on COVID-19 survivors with psychological sequelae.

Compared to conventional networked applications, teleoperation poses widely different requirements, ultra-low latency (ULL) is primary.

The design of the network infrastructure and meaningful performance metrics are crucial for seamless TI communication. However, existing performance metrics fall severely short of comprehensively characterizing TI performance. We take the first step towards bridging this gap. We take Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) as the basis of our work and identify necessary changes for characterizing TI performance. Through substantial refinements to DTW, we design Effective Time- and Value-Offset (ETVO) -- a new method for measuring the fine-grained performance of TI systems. Through an in-depth objective analysis, we demonstrate the improvements of ETVO over DTW. Through human-in-the-loop subjective experiments, we demonstrate how and why existing QoS and QoE methods fall short of estimating the TI session performance accurately. Using subjective experiments, we demonstrate the behavior of the proposed metrics, their ability to match theoretically derived performance, and finally their ability to reflect user satisfaction in a practical setting.

Plasma proteomics instead identified 14 proteins that showed concentration trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A proteomic predictor trained on single samples obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7) and weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors in an exploratory (AUROC 0.81) as well as in the independent validation cohort (AUROC of 1.0).

RESULTS: The CAUTI rates reduced by 28.01%; the CLABSI rates declined by 37.61%, the SSI rates reduced by 62.39%, while the highest VAP rates were reported in November 2019 (1.9 per 1000 ventilator days). The hand hygiene compliance rates from January 2019 to December 2020 among different healthcare staffs showed a sharply rising trend. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 pandemic highlighted paramount importance regarding compliance to hand hygiene and implementation of standard infection control practices as recommended by World Health Organisation and Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), which can drastically reduce range of HAIs.","output":"Prevention of hospital-acquired infections: A construct during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Astroviruses (AstVs) are common pathogens of a wide range of animal hosts, including mammals and avians, causing gastrointestinal diseases, mainly gastroenteritis and diarrhea. They prompt a significant health problem in newborns and young children and economic losses in the poultry sector and mink farms. Recent studies revealed a growing number of bat species carrying astroviruses with a noticeable prevalence and diversity. Here, we demonstrate the first detection of bat astroviruses (BtAstVs) circulating in the population of insectivorous bats in the territory of Poland. Results: Genetically diverse BtAstVs (n = 18) were found with a varying degree of bat species specificity in five out of 15 bat species in Poland previously recognized as BtAstV hosts. Astroviral RNA was found in 12 out of 98 (12.2%, 95% CI 7.1C20.2) bat intestines, six bat kidneys (6.1%, 95% CI 2.8C12.7) and two bat livers (2.0%, 95% CI 0.4C7.1). Deep sequencing of the astroviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region revealed co-infections in five single bat individuals with highly distinct astrovirus strains. Conclusions: The detection of highly distinct bat astroviruses in Polish bats favors virus recombination and the generation of novel divergent AstVs and creates a potential risk of virus transmission to domestic animals and humans in the country. These findings provide a new insight into molecular epidemiology, prevalence of astroviruses in European bat populations and the risk of interspecies transmission to other animals including humans.","output":"First Detection of Bat Astroviruses (BtAstVs) among Bats in Poland: The Genetic BtAstVs Diversity Reveals Multiple Co-Infection of Bats with Different Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TV serials are a popular source of entertainment.

IL-6 also plays a complex role in hemostasis and thrombosis. We observed a transient elevation of D-dimer in our patients who received tocilizumab, which triggered this study. Methods A retrospective hospital-based cohort analysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received tocilizumab during the study period of March 15, 2020, to May 20, 2020, was conducted. We retrieved demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, and patients who were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy prior to tocilizumab administration were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed, and the cause of death and trends of D-dimer and inflammatory markers were studied. Results Out of the 436 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Their median age was 47.5 years. They were 18 males and 6 females;15 patients survived and nine expired. Of the group that survived, 12 received therapeutic anticoagulation. Of the seven patients who did not receive therapeutic anticoagulation, four expired (one from sepsis and three probably from thromboembolic complications) compared to five deaths in the 17 patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation (four from sepsis and one possibly from thromboembolic complications). Conclusions The interplay between IL-6, IL-6 receptor antagonist, and venous thromboembolism is complex. We observed a transient elevation of D-timer in COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab, and a trend toward increased death secondary to thromboembolism.

In early March 2020, we were presented with the challenge of achieving safe delivery of care in clinical practice for a group of patients that are already at higher risk of morbidity from COVID-19 with only limited guidance. PURPOSE: This article outlines the adjustments made at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre in order to promote optimal care to our patients receiving radiotherapy, and to mitigate infection risk at the department for both patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We share insight into some of the evolving processes that our team have developed since March 2020 in promoting optimal care to patients receiving radiotherapy at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre. These include changes to the department floor, paper flow, supportive care and staffing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As we continue to progress through this pandemic, we accept that there will be an ongoing journey of learning with adjustments to practice and evolving new norm, thereby ensuring we keep our patients and team safe and well.

Thus, this study examined the 5Cs of PYD (competence, confidence, character, connection, and caring) and their importance to purpose in life, hope, and well-being in a sample of emerging adult undergraduate university students in Malaysia. Data were collected from 400 participants from 15 Malaysian universities (132 males, 268 females; ages ranged from 18 to 26 years old, M = 22). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that two of the 5Cs of PYD (confidence and connection) as well as hope were important to explaining variation in well-being. The findings imply that there are strong links between PYD, especially confidence and connection, and well-being, while purpose in life and hope were indirectly related to the 2Cs (confidence and connection) of PYD and well-being.

We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York Citys Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014C2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at low (but not zero) risk and some or high risk: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods.

It is caused by a new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is imperative for relapsing current antiviral therapeutics owing to randomized genetic drift in global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A molecular mechanism behind the emerging genomic variants is not yet understood for the prioritization of selective antivirals. The present computational study was aimed to repurpose existing antivirals for Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by uncovering a hijack mechanism based on structural and functional characteristics of protein variants. Forty-one protein mutations were identified in 12 Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by analysis of genome variations across 460 genome sequences obtained from 30 geographic sites in India. Two unique mutations such as W6152R and N5928H found in exonuclease of Surat (GBRC275b) and Gandhinagar (GBRC239) isolates. We report for the first time the impact of folding rate on stabilizing/retaining a sequence-structure-function-virulence link of emerging protein variants leading to accommodate hijack ability from current antivirals.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests there is an association between upper respiratory viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, and asthma exacerbations. Virally induced airways hyperreactivity has been associated with elevated numbers of inflammatory cells in the bronchial mucosa. Upon virus infection, respiratory epithelial cells produce proinflammatory cytokines, including IL\\\\6, IL\\\\8, RANTES, and GM\\\\CSF, which could contribute to the increased inflammatory cell recruitment noted in the airways. Whether or not a viral infection triggers an asthma attack may depend upon many factors, including the types of inflammatory cells recruited to the airways, the viral load, and variations in the host antiviral response. There is evidence to support the idea that eosinophils from asthmatic and symptomatic atopic subjects may be primed to respond to chemotactic cytokines produced by infected epithelial cells. Rhinovirus infections may therefore enhance airway eosinophilia in asthmatics, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness and impaired pulmonary function. Nitric oxide is a potent inhibitor of both rhinovirus\\\\induced cytokine production and viral replication and may play an important role in the host response to viral infections.

The results clearly document an inverse correlation of age with the incidence of SGVHD. Virtually a 100% incidence of SGVHD occurs in Lewis rats when syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy are started when the animals are 4 wk of age. Thereafter, there is a dramatic decline in the incidence of SGVHD with the increasing age of the animals. Although the age of the recipient was important, the most significant effect was the age of the marrow donor. Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was virtually incapable of eliciting SGVHD after BMT and CsA therapy. Furthermore, mixing the marrow from mature and immature animals resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD, implicating a regulatory effect present in the marrow from older rats.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 100 asymptomatic Lebanese subjects that have tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Fifty patients received standard preventive treatment, mainly supplements, and the experimental group received a single dose (according to body weight) of ivermectin, in addition to the same supplements the control group received. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p = 0.06) between Ct-values of the two groups before the regimen was started (day zero), indicating that subjects in both groups had similar viral loads. At 72 h after the regimen started, the increase in Ct-values was dramatically higher in the ivermectin than in the control group. In the ivermectin group, Ct increased from 15.13  2.07 (day zero) to 30.14  6.22 (day three; mean  SD), compared to the control group, where the Ct values increased only from 14.20  2.48 (day zero) to 18.96  3.26 (day three; mean  SD). Moreover, more subjects in the control group developed clinical symptoms. Three individuals (6%) required hospitalization, compared to the ivermectin group (0%).

MAIN FINDINGS: We observed changes in body weight during lockdown in 80 % of women, and a significant increase in BMI in comparison to that observed before (p = .001). We observed a high percentage of non-adherence to the Mediterranean pattern during lockdown due to higher frequency of consumption of sweet/pastries, cheese and meat, rather than fruit, vegetables and legumes. Before lockdown 36.4 % women were snack consumers while during lockdown 55 % (p = .002). By considering individuals attitude to snack consumption, we observed an increase related to boredom (p=<.0001) and anxiety (p = .05) during lockdown. Increased levels of anxiety and sadness were observed in about 30 %, and of boredom in 25 %. The percentage of women worried about their planning infertility treatment was more than 50 %.

S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-II) to enter into the lungs through membrane proteases consequently inflicting the extensive viral load through rapid replication mechanisms. Despite several research efforts, challenges in COVID-19 management still persist at various levels that include (a) availability of a low cost and rapid self-screening test, (b) lack of an effective vaccine which works against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, and (c) lack of a potent drug that can reduce the complications of COVID-19. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated process due to the emergence of mutant variants with greater virulence and their ability to invoke intricate lung pathophysiology. Moreover, the lack of a thorough understanding about the virus transmission mechanisms and complete pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is making it hard for medical scientists to develop a better strategy to prevent the spread of the virus and design a clinically viable vaccine to protect individuals from being infected. A recent report has tested the hypothesis of T cell immunity and found effective when compared to the antibody response in agammaglobulinemic patients. Understanding SARS-CoV-2-induced changes such as Th-2 immunopathological variations, mononuclear cell & eosinophil infiltration of the lung and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19 patients provides key insights to develop potential therapeutic interventions for immediate clinical management. Therefore, in this review, we have described the details of rapid detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular and serological tests and addressed different therapeutic modalities used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Based on a critical analysis of the available literature about in silico screens against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the authors illustrate how frequently overconfident conclusions are being drawn in COVID-19 related literature. Expert opinion: Most of the current clinical trials on potential COVID-19 treatments are, in fact, drug repurposing examples. In October 2020, the FDA approved a repurposed antiviral, remdesivir, as the first treatment for COVID-19. Considering the high expectations invested in approaching therapeutic solutions, the scientific community must be careful not to raise unrealistic expectations.

Machine Learning (ML) showed optimal performance in automatically distinguishing these two diseases from clinical and imaging data. However, the most common applied ML algorithms provide high accuracy at expense of findings intelligibility. In this work, a novel ML glass-box model, the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), based on Generalized Additive Models plus interactions (GA(2)Ms), was employed to obtain interpretability in classifying PD and SWEDD while still providing optimal performance. Dataset (168 healthy controls, HC; 396 PD; 58 SWEDD) was obtained from PPMI database and consisted of 178 among clinical and imaging features. Six binary EBM classifiers were trained on feature space with (SBR) and without (noSBR) dopaminergic striatal specific binding ratio: HC-PD(SBR), HC-SWEDD(SBR), PD-SWEDD(SBR) and HC-PD(noSBR), HC-SWEDD(noSBR), PD-SWEDD(noSBR).

METHODS: We used Google Trends to assess the public online interest for search terms ear pain, ear infection, and ear drops in 5 English and nonCEnglish-speaking countries from both hemispheres based on time series data. We performed our analysis for the time frame between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019. First, we assessed whether our search terms were most relevant to the topics of ear pain, ear infection, and ear drops. We then tested the reliability of Google Trends time series data using the intraclass correlation coefficient. In a second step, we computed univariate time series plots to depict peaks in web-based interest. In the last step, we used the cosinor analysis to test the statistical significance of seasonal interest peaks. RESULTS: In the first part of the study, it was revealed that ear infection, ear pain, and ear drops were the most relevant search terms in the noted time frame. Next, the intraclass correlation analysis showed a moderate to excellent reliability for all 5 countries 3 primary search terms. The subsequent analysis revealed winter interest peaks for ear infection and ear pain. On the other hand, the World Wide Web search for ear drops peaked annually during the summer months. All peaks were statistically significant as revealed by the cosinor model (all P values <.001).

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 associated with differential response to corticosteroid therapy? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital treated between January and February 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was the administration of IV corticosteroids. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Marginal structural modeling was used to account for baseline and time-dependent confounders. An unsupervised machine learning approach was carried out to identify phenotypes of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included; 280 of 428 patients (65.4%) received corticosteroid therapy. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid therapy than in those who did not (53.9% vs 19.6%; P < .0001). After marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not associated significantly with 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.54-1.18; P = .26). Our analysis identified two phenotypes of COVID-19, and compared with the hypoinflammatory phenotype, the hyperinflammatory phenotype was characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher rates of complications.

This confluence is grounded on their common attunement to valuing as a problematic and relational process, their equally common updates with theories of institutions, and a further conceptual development regarding the temporalities of valuation. I advance the argument in four steps. First, looking at how the question about the scientific value of the ISS is far from settled, I show how valuation is always about something considered problematic and indeterminate. Second, characterizing the ISS at the intersection of different criteria of assessment, I stress the nature of valuation as a fundamentally perspectival and interpretive process, and show how a hermeneutic approach can complement some of the limitations of pragmatism in this regard. Third, I look at the question of institutions considering how some modes of assessment sediment more successfully than others. Fourth, I argue that, while providing insights towards it, pragmatist and hermeneutic approaches to valuation have not fully grasped its temporal nature as a process, and outline ways to open this line of inquiry. I conclude with some ideas for studies in sociology of science to re-entangle detailed case studies of scientific practice with the study of how institutions make claims of worth about the nature of science, I propose ways to extend these arguments to other studies of what I call iridescent institutions, and I make some considerations about our stance as sociologists in these valuation disputes.","output":"From Value to Valuation: Pragmatist and Hermeneutic Orientations for Assessing Science on the International Space Station"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bond mutual funds holding illiquid assets (e.g., corporate bonds) actively manage their positions in Treasuries to buffer redemption shocks.

Despite the observations of complex and diverse conformational changes associated with ligand binding, we found that simply sampling along each of the lowest 30 modes is near optimal for adequately restructuring cryptic sites so they can be detected by existing pocket finding programs like fpocket and concavity. We further trained machine-learning protocols to optimize the combination of the sampling-enhanced pocket scores with other dynamic and conservation scores, which only slightly improved the performance.

However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72).

Little research has been conducted to understand the role of social capital in womens sexual and reproductive health and how this can be harnessed to improve health in humanitarian settings. We synthesised the evidence to examine the nexus of womens sexual and reproductive health and rights and social capital in humanitarian contexts. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of qualitative studies. The preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used to identify peer-reviewed, qualitative studies conducted in humanitarian settings published since 1999. We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest Health & Medicine, PubMed, Embase and Web of science core collection and assessed quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. We used a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesise and analyse the data. FINDINGS: Of 6749 initially identified studies, we included 19 studies, of which 18 were in conflict-related humanitarian settings and one in a natural disaster setting. The analysis revealed that the main form of social capital available to women was bonding social capital or strong links between people within groups of similar characteristics. There was limited use of bridging social capital, consisting of weaker connections between people of approximately equal status and power but with different characteristics. The primary social capital mechanisms that played a role in womens sexual and reproductive health and rights were social support, informal social control and collective action. Depending on the nature of the values, norms and traditions shared by network members, these social capital mechanisms had the potential to both facilitate and hinder positive health outcomes for women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding social capital in planning sexual and reproductive health responses in humanitarian settings. The analysis highlights the need to investigate social capital from an individual perspective to expose the intra-network dynamics that shape womens experiences. Insights could help inform community-based preparedness and response programs aimed at improving the demand for and access to quality sexual and reproductive health services in humanitarian settings.

Shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment. Helmet is as effective interface to provide Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) non-invasively. We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as an effective treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations (DNI). Methods: In this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy (i.e. non-rebreathing mask) due to COVID-19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system. Patients data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter. CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or death. Results: A total of 306 patients were included;42% were deemed as DNI. Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69% of the full-treatment and 28% of the DNI patients ( P< 0.001). With helmet CPAP, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio doubled from about 100 to 200 mmHg ( P< 0.001);respiratory rate decreased from 28 [22-32] to 24 [20-29] breaths per minute, P <0.001).

This has been made feasible via a new telemedicine system and by developing a telemedicine app. Patients can use several technologies to communicate with healthcare professionals. For comfort and privacy, you can employ live visual media. The creation of telemedicine apps is the most attractive and practical investment. With the growing availability and usage of technology in PD, the focus of these technologies is gradually turning toward the disease's vast spectrum of Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS).

RESULTS: Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset (two or more confirmed cases in a small area) is more common in the children group and senior group. Older patients were found to have a higher incidence of the highest clinical classification (severe or critical) in these four groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Child patients are mostly negative for chest CT or with involvement of only one lobe of the lung; while in older patients, there was a higher incidence of involvement of four or five lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement was also found to have significant differences in the four age groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging features of patients in different age groups were found to be significantly different.

We aimed to determine which clinical and pregnancy-related factors were associated with severe and critical COVID illness in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of women with confirmed intrauterine pregnancy and positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 who presented to an academic medical center in New York City from 1 March 2020 to 1 July 2020. Severe and critical COVID-19 disease was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Women with severe/critical disease were compared to women with asymptomatic/mild disease. Continuous variables were compared with MannCWhitney or t-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-square and Fishers exact. Statistical significance was set at p < .05. Multivariable logistic regression was performed including variables that were significantly different between groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-three patients were included, 186 (79.8%) with asymptomatic/mild disease and 47 (20.2%) with severe/critical disease. Women with asymptomatic/mild disease were compared to those with severe/critical disease.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Methods: SiRNAs targeting Sirt1-7 were transfected into macrophages to screen the antiviral function. Sirt5 deficient mice or macrophages were subjected to viral infection to assess in vivo and in vitro function of Sirt5 by detecting cytokines, viral replicates and survival rate. Immunoprecipitation, WesternBlot and luciferase reporter assay were used to reveal molecular mechanism. Results: In this study, we functionally screened seven Sirtuin family members, and found that Sirtuin5 (Sirt5) promotes antiviral signaling and responses. Sirt5 deficiency leads to attenuated antiviral innate immunity in vivo and in vitro upon viral infection by decreasing TBK1-IRF3 activation and type I IFN production. Sirt5 overexpression increased antiviral innate immunity. Mechanism investigation revealed that Sirt5 interacts with DDX3 and demalonylates DDX3, which is critical for TBK1-IRF3 activation. Mutation of the demalonylation lysine sites (K66, K130, and K162) of DDX3 increased ifn transcription. Furthermore, the acetylation on lysine 118 of DDX3 positively regulated ifn transcription, whereas Sirt5 could not deacetylate this site. Conclusion: Sirt5 promotes anti- RNA and DNA virus innate immune responses by increasing TBK1 signaling through demalonylating DDX3, which identifies a novel regulatory pathway of antiviral innate immune response.","output":"Demalonylation of DDX3 by Sirtuin 5 promotes antiviral innate immune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines can offer a route out of the pandemic, yet initial research suggests that many are unwilling to be vaccinated.

To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that cause a largely viral mediated immune-related syndrome similar to the SARS epidemic. Following metagenomic sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 closely resembles SARS-CoV (79% similarity) and MERS-CoV virus (50% similarity). Despite this, clinical observations have found varying degrees of infectivity and pathogenesis amongst these viruses. Phylogenetic origins of SARS-CoV-2 have found connections to bats and pangolins as possible zoonotic reservoirs. It enters the host cells via the receptor binding site of the ACE-2 receptor. Upon entering the host cells, cytopathic effects and interruption of respiratory cilia occur with a resultant cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Common clinical features of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. COVID-19 infected patients also present with various gastrointestinal, gustatory, dermatologic, ocular, cardiovascular, neurologic and coagulopathic manifestations. Dyspnea, sore throat, nasal congestion, musculoskeletal pain, headaches and chills were also observed. Emerging data supports that COVID 19 has disproportionately affected specific ethnic groups, particularly racial minorities for various health and institutional reasons. It is estimated around 5% of all cases are severe, presenting with respiratory failure, shock, acute respiratory syndrome and arrhythmias. Co-infection with other pathogens was also seen with various other viruses such as rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other coronaviruses. COVID-19 is able to spread asymptomatically and causes slightly different manifestations in pregnant ladies and the pediatric populations.

However, little is known about the influence of patient race and ethnicity on the decision to order diagnostic radiology exams in the acute care setting. This study examines the role of patient race and ethnicity on the likelihood of diagnostic imaging exams being ordered during United States emergency department encounters. METHODS Publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department sample for the years 2006-2016 was compiled. The proportion of patient encounters where diagnostic imaging was ordered was tabulated by race/ethnicity, sub-divided by imaging modality. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the influence of patient race/ethnicity on the ordering of diagnostic imaging controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Survey weighting variables were used to formulate national-level estimates. RESULTS Using the weighted data, an average of 131,558,553 patient encounters were included each year for the 11-year study period. Imaging was used at 46% of all visits although this varied significantly by patient race and ethnicity with white patients receiving medical imaging at 49% of visits and non-white patients at 41% of visits (p < 0.001). This effect persisted in the controlled regression model and across all imaging modalities with the exception of ultrasound. Other factors with a significant influence on imaging use included patient age, gender, insurance status, number of co-morbidities, hospital setting (urban vs non-urban) and hospital region. There was no evidence to suggest that the disparate use of imaging by patient race and ethnicity changed over the 11-year study time period. CONCLUSION The likelihood that a diagnostic imaging exam will be ordered during United States emergency department encounters differs significantly by patient race and ethnicity even when controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Further work must be done to understand and mitigate what may represent systematic bias and ensure equitable use of health care resources.","output":"The influence of patient race on the use of diagnostic imaging in United States emergency departments: data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The aim of this review was to assess the evidence that occupational safety and health (OSH) legislative and regulatory policy could improve the working environment in terms of reduced levels of industrial injuries and fatalities, musculoskeletal disorders, worker complaints, sick leave and adverse occupational exposures. Methods A systematic literature review covering the years 1966?2017 (February) was undertaken to capture both published and gray literature studies of OSH work environment interventions with quantitative measures of intervention effects. Studies that met specified in- and exclusion criteria went through an assessment of methodological quality. Included studies were grouped into five thematic domains: (i) introduction of OHS legislation, (ii) inspection/enforcement activity, (iii) training, such as improving knowledge, (iv), campaigns, and (v) introduction of technical device, such as mechanical lifting aids. The evidence synthesis was based on meta-analysis and a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results The search for peer-reviewed literature identified 14 743 journal articles of which 45 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were eligible for meta-analysis. We identified 5181 articles and reports in the gray literature, of which 16 were evaluated qualitatively. There was moderately strong evidence for improvement by OHS legislation and inspections with respect to injuries and compliance. Conclusions This review indicates that legislative and regulatory policy may reduce injuries and fatalities and improve compliance with OHS regulation. A major research gap was identified with respect to the effects of OSH regulation targeting psychological and musculoskeletal disorders.","output":"Systematic literature review on the effects of occupational safety and health (OSH) interventions at the workplace."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Imaging TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Point-of-care echocardiography plays an important role in evaluating critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Obtainable hemodynamic data has shown to be helpful in differentiating between different types of shocks and guiding management. However, this tool was frequently limited in the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the increasing number of critically ill patients requiring prone positioning for profound hypoxemia. Current literature has limited data regarding feasibility and utility of Point-of-Care Echocardiography in prone patients. METHODS: This a prospective case series involving a total of 21 patients with acute respiratory failure in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and prone-positioning, who were randomly enrolled over 4 months period. All patients underwent a bedside echocardiogram to visualize the apical four-chamber and five-chamber views, with the goal of assessing left ventricular function, right ventricular function and right ventricular size. The view was obtained with placing the phased array probe below the left nipple with the transducer indicator pointing toward patient left shoulder followed by moving the probe medially and laterally to obtain the best view. All images were reviewed by an independent board-certified cardiologist to assess quality and interpretability of images. RESULTS: Total of 21 patients were randomly included over a period of 4 months. Mean age was 56 years old with equal gender distribution (male 52%) and median BMI of 21 (IQR 24.8-37.8). Majority patients were ventilated with assist control/volume control mode with median PEEP of 12 (IQR 10-14) and tidal volume of 6 cc/Kg (IQR 6-7.5). LV function was normal in 14/21 (66%), decreased in 5/21 (23%), and unobtainable 2/21 (10%). Right ventricular function was normal on 14/21 (66%), decreased in 4/21 (19%), unobtainable 3/21 (14%). Median VTI was 18.9 (SD + 6.3), mean TAPSE was 17.6 (SD +6), median E/E 6.25 (IQR 5-8). 19/21 images were available for review by cardiology. Out of those, 12/19 (63%) scans considered of an adequate image quality and interpretability. While no difference in images quality noted between genders, a BMI of 35 and more significantly correlated with poor images [4/5 (80%) vs. 3/11 (21%);p=0.01]. In addition, left lateral prone positioning was more likely to be associated with adequate quality 5/6 (83%) as compared to other positions 6/11 (54%). CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care echocardiography to obtain apical cardiac views is feasible in certain prone patients and can be optimized by left lateral positioning. Further studies are needed to explore and standardize the role of echocardiography in patients requiring prolonged proning. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Point-of-care echocardiography can be adequate enough to provide valuable quantitative and qualitative hemodynamic data in critically ill proned patients.

Climate change will influence the prevalence of infectious diseases of both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to detect known and previously unknown viruses in Eurasian tundra reindeer. In total, 623 nasal and 477 rectal swab samples were collected from reindeer herds in Fennoscandia, Iceland, and Eastern Russia during 2016-2019. Next-generation sequencing analysis and BLAST-homology searches indicated the presence of viruses of domesticated and wild animals, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine papillomavirus, alcephaline herpesvirus 1 and 2, deer mastadenovirus B, bovine rotavirus, and roe deer picobirnavirus. Several viral species previously found in reindeer and some novel species were detected, although the clinical relevance of these viruses in reindeer is largely unknown.

METHODS: A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?. The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed. FINDINGS: A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus. CONCLUSION: Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself.

As of October 2020, over 44 million confirmed cases and more than 1,160,000 deaths have been reported globally, and the toll is likely to be much higher before the pandemic is over. There are currently little therapeutic options available and new potential targets are intensively investigated. Recently, Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) has emerged as an interesting candidate. Elevated levels of BTK activity have been reported in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, compared to those from healthy volunteers. Importantly, various studies confirmed empirically that administration of BTK inhibitors (Acalabrutinib and Ibrutinib) decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality rate for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Herein, we review the current information regarding the role of BTK in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the suitability of its inhibitors as drugs to treat COVID-19. Implications: The use of BTK inhibitors in the management of COVID-19 shows promise in reducing the severity of the immune response to the infection and thus mortality. However, BTK inhibition may be contributing in other ways to inhibit the effects of the virus and this will need to be carefully studied.","output":"Relevance of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) as a target for COVID-19 therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cDNAs of two turkey cytokines, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-13, were cloned using oligonucleotide primers designed from their chicken orthologues.

This has created the need to develop better and reusable protective masks with built-in antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and aerosol filtration properties to prevent the transmission of air-borne pathogens such as the coronaviruses. Herein, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets are used to prepare modified polycotton fabrics having excellent antibacterial activity and photothermal properties. Upon sunlight irradiation, the nanosheet-modified fabrics rapidly increased the surface temperature to a77 C, making them ideal for sunlight-mediated self-disinfection. Complete self-disinfection of the nanosheet-modified fabric was achieved within 3 min of irradiation, making the fabrics favorably reusable upon self-disinfection. The nanosheet-modified fabrics maintained the antibacterial efficiency even after 60 washing cycles. Furthermore, the particle filtration efficiency of three-layered surgical masks was found to be significantly improved through incorporation of the MoS2-modified fabric as an additional layer of protective clothing, without compromising the breathability of the masks. The repurposed surgical masks could filter out around 97% of 200 nm particles and 96% of 100 nm particles, thus making them potentially useful for preventing the spread of coronaviruses (120 nm) by trapping them along with antibacterial protection against other airborne pathogens.","output":"Reusable MoS2-Modified Antibacterial Fabrics with Photothermal Disinfection Properties for Repurposing of Personal Protective Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The single stranded RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive addition to the already leading global cause of mortality, viral respiratory tract infections. Characterized by and associated with early and deleteriously enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by respiratory epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 illness has the potential to inflict acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Due to the fast spreading nature of COVID-19 and the current lack of a vaccine or specific pharmaceutical treatments, understanding of viral pathogenesis, behavioral prophylaxis, and mitigation tactics are of great public health concern. This review article outlines the immune response to viral pathogens, and due to the novelty of COVID-19 and the large body of evidence suggesting the respiratory and immune benefits from regular moderate intensity exercise, provides observational and mechanistic evidence from research on other viral infections that suggests strategically planned exercise regimens may help reduce susceptibility to infection, while also mitigating severe immune responses to infection commonly associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. We propose that regular moderate intensity exercise should be considered as part of a combinatorial approach including widespread hygiene initiatives, properly planned and well-executed social distancing policies, and use of efficacious facial coverings like N95 respirators.

In particular, these salts can be employed as neuroprotective agents since lithium ions demonstrate neuroprotective properties through inhibition of glycogen synthetase kinase-3 and other target proteins, increasing concentrations of endogenous neurotrofic factors. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of organic lithium salts presented here indicate their potential as neuroprotectors. Chemoreactomic modeling of lithium salts made it possible to select lithium ascorbate as a suitable candidate for further research. A neurocytological study on cerebellar granular neurons in culture under conditions of moderate glutamate stress showed that lithium ascorbate was more effective in supporting neuronal survival than chloride or carbonate, i.e., inorganic lithium salts. Biodistribution studies indicated accumulation of lithium ions in a sort of depot, potentially consisting of the brain, aorta, and femur. Lithium ascorbate is characterized by extremely low acute and chronic toxicity (LD50 > 5000 mg/kg) and also shows a moderate antitumor effect when used in doses studied (5 or 10 mg/kg). Studies on the model of alcohol intoxication in rats have shown that intake of lithium ascorbate in doses either 5, 10 or 30 mg/kg did not only reduced brain damage due to ischemia, but also improved the preservation of myelin sheaths of neurons.","output":"Lithium Ascorbate as a Promising Neuroprotector: Fundamental and Experimental Studies of an Organic Lithium Salt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was aimed to explore the precise dose of corticosteroid therapy in critical COVID-19.

Nonsurvivors had more dyspnea symptoms, fewer days of hospitalization, shorter duration of alveolitis and fibrosis. High-dose daily corticosteroid therapy (150 mg/d) was associated with shorter survival time and lower lymphocyte count in fibrosis phase. Moreover, a high cumulative dose (604 mg) was tied to longer duration of virus shedding, lower oxygenation index (OI), higher incidence of tracheal intubation, fewer lymphocytes and higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In alveolitis phase, the low-to-moderate-dose daily corticosteroid therapy and a small cumulative dose reduced lymphocytes.

The fourth and fifth waves started under the declaration of the state of emergency and coincided with an increase in the number of people. However, the contribution of the number of people to R(t) was inconsistent, even when the number of people was of the same magnitude.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data collected through a nationwide audit of people admitted to hospital with diabetes and COVID-19, conducted by the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists from March to October 2020. Prespecified demographic, clinical, medication and laboratory data were collected from the electronic and paper medical record systems of the participating hospitals by local clinicians. The primary outcome of the study, severe COVID-19, was defined as death in hospital and/or admission to the adult intensive care unit (AICU). Logistic regression models were used to generate age-adjusted ORs. RESULTS: Forty UK centres submitted data. The final dataset included 196 adults who were admitted to hospital and had both type 1 diabetes and COVID-19 on admission (male sex 55%, white 70%, with mean [SD] age 62 [19] years, BMI 28.3 [7.3] kg/m(2) and last recorded HbA(1c) 76 [31] mmol/mol [9.1 (5.0)%]).

We used high-throughput sequencing whole-genome data coupled with bottleneck analysis to retrace the pathways of viral transmission in two nosocomial outbreaks that were previously characterised by epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressures, and diversity at the within-host level for both outbreaks. Our findings show evidence of within-host selection and transmission of variants between samples. Both bottleneck and diversity analyses highlight within-host and consensus-level variants shared by putative source-recipient pairs in both outbreaks, suggesting that certain within-host variants in these outbreaks may have been transmitted upon infection rather than arising de novo independently within multiple hosts. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of combining within-host diversity and bottleneck estimations for elucidating transmission events in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, provide insight into the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, provide a list of candidate targets of positive selection for further investigation, and demonstrate that within-host variants can be transferred between patients.

DISCUSSION: This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart, causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by nucleic acid testing.

The research is motivated by and addresses the supply chain challenges encountered by a Canadian provincial healthcare provider during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply, price, and demand of PPE are the uncertain parameters. The [Formula: see text]-constraint method is implemented to generate efficient solutions along the trade-off between cost minimization and service level maximization. Decision makers can easily adjust model conservatism through the ambiguity set size parameter. Experiments investigate the effects of model conservatism on optimal procurement decisions such as the portion of the supply base dedicated to long-term fixed contracts. Other types of PPE sources considered by the model are one-time open-market purchases and federal emergency PPE stockpiles. The study recommends that during pandemics health care providers use distributionally robust optimization with the ambiguity set size falling in one of three intervals based on decision makers relative preferences for average cost performance, worst-case cost performance, or cost variance. The study also highlights the importance of surveillance and early warning systems to allow supply chain decision makers to trigger contingency plans such as locking contracts, reinforcing logistical capacities and drawing from emergency stockpiles. These emergency stockpiles are shown to play efficient hedging functions in allowing healthcare supply chain decision makers to compensate variations in deliveries from contract and open-market suppliers.","output":"Distributionally robust optimization of a Canadian healthcare supply chain to enhance resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is an infectious disease which has spread globally since 2019, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Since it is a new virus, it takes some time to develop a vaccine against it. Until then, the best way to prevent the fast spread of the virus is to enable the proper social distancing and isolation or containment to identify potential patients. Since the virus has up to 14 days of the incubation period, it is important to identify all the social interactions during this period and enforce social isolation for such potential patients. However, proper social interaction tracking methods and patient prediction methods based on such data are missing for the moment. This paper focuses on tracking the social interaction of users and predict the infection possibility based on social interactions. We first developed a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and GPS based social interaction tracking system. Then, we developed an algorithm to predict the possibility of being infected with COVID-19 based on the collected data. Finally, a prototype of the system is implemented with a mobile app and a web monitoring tool. In addition, we performed a simulation of the system with a graph-based model to analyze the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and it verifies that self-isolation is important in slowing down the disease progression.","output":"Social Interaction Tracking and Patient Prediction System for Potential COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. To report our experience treating adnexal masses using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments. Study Design. This prospective feasibility study included 14 women with symptomatic and persistent adnexal masses. Removal of adnexal masses via single-incision laparoscopic surgery using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments was performed. Results. All of the patients had symptomatic complex adnexal masses. Mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range: 21-61 years) and mean duration of surgery was 71 min (range: 45-130 min). All surgeries were performed using nonroticulating straight laparoscopic instruments. Mean tumor diameter was 6 cm (range: 5-12 cm). All patient pathology reports were benign. None of the patients converted to laparotomy. All the patients were discharged on postoperative d1. Postoperatively, all the patients were satisfied with their incision and cosmetic results. Conclusion. All 14 patients were successfully treated using standard, straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments via the SILS port. This procedure can reduce the cost of treatment, which may eventually lead to more widespread use of the SILS port approach. Furthermore, concomitant surgical procedures are possible using this approach.

To the authors' knowledge, no treatment for these cysts has ever been published. OBJECTIVES This short case series describes a surgical technique of marsupialization as a treatment option for these cysts and proposes a pathogenesis for cyst formation. CASES DESCRIPTION Three dogs were each referred for a unilateral subconjunctival mass-like lesion involving the bulbar side of the nictitating membrane. Complete ophthalmologic examination revealed a pink, translucent, soft, and nonpainful mass protruding from the bulbar surface of the nictitating membrane in all cases. Treatment consisted in marsupialization of the cyst on the palpebral surface of the nictitating membrane and was curative with no short-term postoperative complication and favorable long-term outcome for the three dogs. Histopathological findings were consistent with a lacrimal cyst. CONCLUSION Marsupialization appears to be a safe, simple, and effective treatment for nictitating membrane cyst secondary to surgical correction of gland prolapse using conjunctival pocket technique in dogs. Further studies on a larger number of cases are necessary to determine whether marsupialization is the technique of choice and to further investigate the pathophysiology of cyst formation after conjunctival pocket repositioning of prolapsed glands.","output":"Marsupialization of a cyst of the nictitating membrane in three dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose On January 7, 2020, China reported a group of cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This novel virus spread rapidly to other countries. As of August 2020, there are close to 6 million diagnosed cases in the United States and 460,000 diagnosed cases in New York State. The purpose of this article is to examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trainees in a New York City hospital. To achieve this goal, trainees of the Brooklyn Hospital Center were sent a questionnaire via e-mail. The questionnaire asked about the residents demographic characteristics, health information, and self-report questions regarding anxiety, depression, and PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Methods Participants were trainees at the Brooklyn Hospital Center from the OMFS (oral and maxillofacial surgery), general dentistry, and other medical departments. A 3-part survey including demographic information, a PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and an impact of events score revised (IES-R) questionnaire was obtained. Descriptive analysis assessed participant demographic characteristics and mean scores on questionnaires. Additionally, independent samples t-test was used to determine statistical difference in mean scores on PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaires between dental (OMFS and general dentistry) and medical specialties. Bivariate correlation was used to assess the relationship between scores on the PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaires. Level of significance was accepted at .05. Results The mean score on the PHQ-9 questionnaire was significantly higher for dental compared to medical specialties (18.9 vs 7.24, P < .001). Likewise, for the IES-R questionnaire, the dental group scored significantly higher than the medical group (61.9 vs 30.36, P < .001). Furthermore, depression severity was much worse for the dental group: 7 (33.3% vs 8.9% medical, P < .001) were classified as severe and 12 (57.1% vs 8.9% medical, P = .013) were moderately severe. Conclusion Currently, trainees are facing enormous isolation, burnout, and fear of contracting and transmitting COVID-19.1 Trainees are also facing concerns about inadequate training (clinical and didactic). Previous literature has demonstrated that one's physical location and holding an intermediate title during a pandemic were associated with severe depression, distress, and anxiety.2-4 The participants of our study were trainees from the oral and maxillofacial surgery, general dentistry, and other medical specialty departments. The trainees from the dental department scored significantly higher on the IES-R and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Many participants had graduated from dental school less than a year ago. Additionally, this study was conducted in New York, which was the epicenter to the pandemic for a period of time. Being aware of the impact of the coronavirus on health care workers is an important step in providing intervention.

Surprisingly, the glycoproteins retained in the ER were rapidly processed by cis/medial Golgi enzymes but not by trans Golgi enzymes. An explanation for these observations was provided from morphological studies at both the light and electron microscopic levels using markers for the cis/medial and trans Golgi. They revealed a rapid and dramatic redistribution to the ER of components of the cis/medial but not the trans Golgi in response to treatment with BFA. Upon removal of BFA, the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was rapidly reestablished and proteins normally transported out of the ER were efficiently and rapidly sorted to their final destinations. These results suggest that BFA disrupts a dynamic membrane-recycling pathway between the ER and cis/medial Golgi, effectively blocking membrane transport out of but not back to the ER.","output":"Rapid redistribution of Golgi proteins into the ER in cells treated with brefeldin A: Evidence for membrane cycling from Golgi to ER"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVEThromboembolic complications continue to be encountered with Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs) despite routine clopidogrel/aspirin antiplatelet therapy.

Patients allergic, or having less than 30% platelet inhibition, to a daily 75-mg dose of clopidogrel received 10 mg of prasugrel daily (n = 20) or 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily (n = 2). The mean ( SD) follow-up duration was 15.8  12.4 months. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score registered before discharge and at each follow-up visit. To control confounding, multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression and propensity score conditioning were used.RESULTSTwenty-six (5.9%) of 437 patients presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The mean patient age was 56.3 years, and 62 were women (14.2%). One of the 7 patients lost to follow-up received prasugrel. One patient was allergic to clopidogrel and prasugrel simultaneously. All patients receiving prasugrel or ticagrelor (n = 22) had an mRS score  2 on their latest follow-up visit (mean score 0.67  1.15). In a multivariate analysis, clopidogrel did not affect the mRS score on last follow-up (p = 0.14). Multivariable logistic regression showed that clopidogrel was not associated with an increased long-term recurrence rate (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01-2.70, p = 0.21), an increased thromboembolic complication rate (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.12-1.67, p = 0.24), or an increased hemorrhagic event rate (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.91-1.64, p = 0.20). None of the patients receiving prasugrel or ticagrelor died or suffered a long-term recurrence or a hemorrhagic event; only 1 patient suffered from mild aphasia subsequent to a thromboembolic event.

In a first phase, the response of health systems and governments was disorganized, but then incisive, also driven by the fear of a new and dramatic phenomenon. In the second phase, several governments, including Italy, accepted the doctrine of coexistence with the virus by putting into practice a series of containment measures aimed at limiting the dramatic sanitary consequences while not jeopardizing the economic and social stability of the country. Here, we present a new mathematical approach to modeling the COVID-19 dynamics that accounts for typical evolution parameters (i.e., virus variants, vaccinations, containment measurements). Reproducing the COVID-19 epidemic spread is an extremely challenging task due to the low reliability of the available data, the lack of recurrent patterns, and the considerable amount and variability of the involved parameters. However, the adoption of fairly uniform criteria among the Italian regions enabled to test and optimize the model in various conditions leading to robust and interesting results. Although the regional variability is quite large and difficult to predict, we have retrospectively obtained reliable indications on which measures were the most appropriate to limit the transmissibility coefficients within detectable ranges for all the regions. To complicate matters further, the rapid spread of the English variant has upset contexts where the propagation of contagion was close to equilibrium conditions, decreeing success or failure of a certain measure. Finally, we assessed the effectiveness of the zone assignment criteria, highlighting how the reactivity of the measures plays a fundamental role in limiting the spread of the infection and thus the total number of deaths, the most important factor in assessing the success of epidemic management.","output":"Integro-differential approach for modeling the COVID-19 dynamics - Impact of confinement measures in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global migration has greatly affected intergenerational family support beyond national borders, in particular adult childrens transnational family caregiving for elderly parents.

The goal of this study was to identify trajectories between adult childrens transnational caregiving for their parents and caregivers wellness in Japanese Americans before and during the pandemic. We conducted semi-structured interviews with Japanese Americans 40 to 59 years of age (N=20) in California before the lockdown and during the increasing number of patients infected with the Delta variant. The qualitative data analysis showed some Japanese Americans periodically returned to Japan to provide caregiving for their parents before the pandemic, while others didnt. However, the former group currently relied on their families in their home country more than before. The limitations led to not only distress over uncertainty but also release from a strong sense of reciprocity and filial responsibility, by changing from physical support to emotional and financial support via online. They also enhanced cultural identity as Japanese Americans, by thriving from discrimination against Asian Americans.

Herein, a cross-sectional study was used to determine the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) IgG antibodies and their association with potential infection risk factors among Jordanians. METHODS A total of 759 serum samples were collected (January to February 2020) and analyzed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Estimates for population seropositivity were determined by weighting the age-specific seroprevalence by the size of the population in each age stratum. RESULTS The population estimate for HSV-1 seroprevalence was 75.3%. After adjustment for possible confounders, regression analysis revealed higher seroprevalence with increase in age (p < 0.005) and low household income (p = 0.002). The population estimate for HSV-2 seroprevalence was 2.9%. No significant differences in HSV-2 seroprevalence were observed in association with age, gender, family size, educational level, and socioeconomic status, likely due to low seropositivity.

To further our understanding of this critical and worldwide issue, we conducted a systematic review to understand whether, and how, PLACI access and use essential formal supports and services. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched 6 databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Sociological Abstracts) to identify quantitative and mixed-method literature on formal service use among PLACI. The initial search was conducted in 2018 and updated in 2020. RESULTS: We identified 32 studies published between 1992 and 2019, representing 13 countries, that met our criteria: 16 reported on health services and 26 on social services. Most studies compared PLACI with people with cognitive impairment living with others. Health service use was lower or similar among PLACI, as opposed to counterparts living with others. Most studies reported a higher use of social services (e.g., home services) among PLACI than those living with others. Overall use of essential home service among PLACI was higher in Europe than in the United States, a country where large portions of PLACI were reported receiving no formal services. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We identified wide variability among countries and major gaps in service use. Results for use of health services were mixed, although our findings suggest that PLACI may have fewer physician visits than counterparts living with others. Our findings suggest that varying policies and budgets for these services among countries may have affected our findings. We encourage researchers to evaluate and compare the influence of social policies in the well-being of PLACI.

The results show that most high-income countries can reach herd immunity in less than 1 year, whereas low-income countries should reach this state after more than 3 years. With a more equitable vaccine allocation strategy, global herd immunity can be reached in 2021. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants means that an additional 83 days will be needed to reach global herd immunity and that the number of cumulative cases will increase by 113.37% in 2021. With the more equitable vaccine allocation scenario, the number of cumulative cases will increase by only 5.70% without additional vaccine doses. As SARS-CoV-2 variants arise, herd immunity could be delayed to the point that a return to normal life is theoretically impossible in 2021.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hand-sewn end-to-side esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy for the aforementioned patients. METHODS This retrospective cohort study involved examining the medical records of 433 patients who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer from March 2010 to March 2016. All the patients were operated using end-to-side hand-sewn esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. 409 of the patients received a year's worth of follow-up evaluations. All the cases were revisited in 2 weeks as well as in four, eight, and 12 months after surgery. The patients were assessed in terms of postoperative outcomes, including reflux symptoms, anastomotic leakage and stricture, and the need for anastomotic dilatation. RESULTS Hand-sewn anastomosis was carried out in 271 (62.5%) patients, whereas stapled anastomosis was performed in 162 (37.4%) patients. The mean operative times were 214.46  84.33 min and 250.55  43.31 min for the stapled and hand-sewn anastomosis groups, respectively (P = 0.028). The two groups showed no significant differences with respect to stays in intensive care units and hospitals. Postoperatively, 38 (14.67%) cases of anastomotic leakage were detected in the hand-sewn anastomosis group, with incidence being significantly higher than that in the stapled anastomosis group (8 cases or 5.33%; P = 0.002). Anastomotic stricture occurred less frequently in the patients who underwent stapled anastomosis (P = 0.004). Within the one-year follow-up period, the patients treated via hand-sewn anastomosis more frequently required anastomotic dilatation (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis may reduce operation times and decrease the rates of anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, and anastomotic dilatation in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy.","output":"Comparison of end-to-side hand-sewn and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy: an Iranian retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On the account of limited doses of COVID-19 available to the country, the Government of Ghana created a priority list of persons to target for its vaccination agenda. In this paper, we look at trust and how it informs willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine among persons targeted for the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination program in Ghana. METHODS: A sequential mixed-method investigation was conducted among the priority population - persons 60 years and above, frontline government functionaries, health workers, persons with underlying health conditions and, religious leaders and teachers. We sampled 415 respondents from the target population for a survey and 15 religious and traditional leaders from three cities; Accra, Cape Coast and Tamale for follow-up in-depth interviews based on the results of the survey data. Quantitative data is presented with descriptive proportions and multinomial logistic regression and thematic approach is applied to the interview data. RESULTS: Trust and willingness to take the vaccine are high in this priority population. Trust in the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, rather than socioeconomic characteristics of respondents better predicted acceptance. From interview narratives, mistrust in political actors - both local and foreign, believe in superior protection of God and seeming misunderstanding of vaccine development processes countermand acceptance. On the other hand, the professional influence of people in ones social networks, and past triumphs of vaccination programmes against concerning childhood diseases embed trust and acceptance.

DESIGN: International time series, cross-sectional analysis. SELECTED COUNTRIES: Countries having 5500 or more cases (collectively including 85% of the worlds cases) as of 16 April 2020 and that had reached 135 days into their pandemic by 30 July. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The initial severity and late-pandemic performance of countries can reasonably be ranked by COVID-19 cases or deaths per million population. For guiding policy and informing public accountability during the pandemic, we propose mid-pandemic performance rankings based on doubling time in days of the total number of cases and deaths in a country. Rank orderings then follow. RESULTS: At day 25 into a countrys pandemic, cross-country performance variation was modest: in most countries, cumulative deaths doubled in fewer than 5 days. By day 65, and even more so by day 135, great cross-country variation emerged. By day 135, 9 of the 10 top-performing countries on deaths were European, although they were initially hard hit by the pandemic. Thus, rankings change rapidly enough to point to the value of a dynamic indicator. Five countriesBrazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia and Israelwere among the seven poorest performers at day 135 on both cases and deaths. Doubling times for cases and for deaths are positively correlated, but differ sufficiently to point to the value of both indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available data support transparently generated rankings of countries performance against COVID-19 based on doubling times of cases and deaths. It is premature to judge the value of these rankings in practice, but the potential and early experience suggest they might help facilitate identification of good policies and inform judgements on national leadership.","output":"Country performance against COVID-19: rankings for 35 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasingly recognized as a life-threatening superinfection of severe respiratory viral infections, such as influenza. The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to emerging SARS-CoV-2 rose concern about the eventuality of IPA complicating COVID-19 in intensive care unit mechanically-ventilated patients. While the association between severe influenza and IPA has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a specific risk factor for IPA. A variable incidence of such complication has been previously reported, which can be partly attributed to differences in diagnostic strategy and IPA definitions, and possibly local environmental/epidemiological factors. In this article, we discuss the similarities and differences between influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Compared to IAPA, the majority of CAPA cases have been classified as putative rather than proven/probable IPA, in the absence of positive serum galactomannan or histopathologic evidence of angio-invasion. Discrimination between Aspergillus airways colonization and CAPA is difficult. Distinct physiopathology and cytokine profiles of influenza and COVID-19 may explain these discrepancies. Whether CAPA represents a distinct entity is still debatable and many questions remain unanswered, such as its actual incidence, the predisposing role of corticosteroids or immunomodulatory drugs, and the indications for antifungal therapy.","output":"Navigating the uncertainties of COVID-19 associated aspergillosis (CAPA): A comparison with influenza associated aspergillosis (IAPA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cationic polymers have been widely studied for non-viral gene delivery due to their ability to bind genetic material and to interact with cellular membranes. However, their charged nature carries the risk of increased cytotoxicity and interaction with serum proteins, limiting their potential in vivo application. Therefore, hydrophilic or anionic shielding polymers are applied to counteract these effects. Herein, a series of micelle-forming and micelle-shielding polymers were synthesized via RAFT polymerization. The copolymer poly[(n-butyl acrylate)-b-(2-(dimethyl amino)ethyl acrylamide)] (P(nBA-b-DMAEAm)) was assembled into cationic micelles and different shielding polymers were applied, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(4-acryloyl morpholine) (PNAM) or P(NAM-b-AA) block copolymer. These systems were compared to a triblock terpolymer micelle comprising PAA as the middle block. The assemblies were investigated regarding their morphology, interaction with pDNA, cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency, polyplex uptake and endosomal escape. The naked cationic micelle exhibited superior transfection efficiency, but increased cytotoxicity. The addition of shielding polymers led to reduced toxicity. In particular, the triblock terpolymer micelle convinced with high cell viability and no significant loss in efficiency. The highest shielding effect was achieved by layering micelles with P(NAM-b-AA) supporting the colloidal stability at neutral zeta potential and completely restoring cell viability while maintaining moderate transfection efficiencies. The high potential of this micelle-layer-combination for gene delivery was illustrated for the first time.

The aim of this study was to identify vulnerability factors for psychological distress and reduced life satisfaction in the general population. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the role of COVID-related worries for psychological distress and life satisfaction. METHODS: A presumed representative sample for the Norwegian population (n = 1041, response rate = 39.9%) responded to a web-survey in May 2020. The participants were asked about potential vulnerability factors including increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (underlying illness, older age), socioeconomic disadvantage (living alone, unemployment, economic problems), and pre-existing mental health vulnerability (recent exposure to violence, previous mental health challenges). Additional measures included COVID-related worry, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. RESULTS: More than one out of four reported current psychological distress over the threshold for clinically significant symptoms. Socioeconomic disadvantages, including living alone and pre-existing economic challenges, and pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities, including recent exposure to violence and previous mental health problems, were associated with a higher level of psychological distress and a lower level of life satisfaction. A higher level of COVID-related worry was significantly associated with a higher level of psychological distress, and a lower level of life satisfaction, even when adjusting for all the vulnerability factors. CONCLUSION: This study identified several vulnerability factors for mental health problems in the pandemic. Individuals recently exposed to violence and individuals with pre-existing mental health problems are at particular risk. Worrying about the consequences of the pandemic contributes negatively to current mental health. However, worry cannot explain the excess distress in vulnerable groups.

RESULTS The development set for EGPA consisted of 107 cases of EGPA and 450 comparators. The validation set consisted of an additional 119 cases of EGPA and 437 comparators. From 91 candidate items, regression analysis identified 11 items for EPGA, 7 of which were retained. The final criteria and their weights were as follows: maximum eosinophil count 1  109 /liter (+5), obstructive airway disease (+3), nasal polyps (+3), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or anti-proteinase 3 ANCA positivity (-3), extravascular eosinophilic predominant inflammation (+2), mononeuritis multiplex/motor neuropathy not due to radiculopathy (+1), and hematuria (-1).

Here we introduce a simple-yet-powerful ensemble methodology for forecasting the trajectory of dynamic growth processes, such as the spread of infectious diseases, that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Methods: : We propose and assess the performance of two ensemble modeling schemes with different parametric bootstrapping procedures for trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we conduct sequential probabilistic forecasts to evaluate their forecasting performance using simple dynamical growth models with good track records including the Richards model, the generalized-logistic growth model, and the Gompertz model. We first demonstrate the functionality of the method using simulated data from phenomenological models and a mechanistic transmission model. Next, the performance of the method is demonstrated using a diversity of epidemic datasets including scenario outbreak data of the Ebola Forecasting Challenge and real-world epidemic data outbreaks of including influenza, plague, Zika, and COVID-19. Results: : We found that the ensemble method that randomly selects a model from the set of individual models for each time point of the trajectory of the epidemic frequently outcompetes the individual models as well as an alternative ensemble method based on the weighted combination of the individual models and yields broader and more realistic uncertainty bounds for the trajectory envelope and achieves not only better coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval but also improved mean interval scores across a diversity of epidemic datasets.

Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5 untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. RESULTS: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus.

The experiments reveal, that mobile indoor air filters, equipped with high-performance filter media (HEPA - quality), remove particles in the investigated rooms in relevant submicron size classes (x < 1 m) efficiently and uniformly over time. For the description of the local decrease in particle concentration a simple mathematical model based on a transient continuous stirred tank reactor was applied. The local decay curves obtained in the different room-types were compared to simulated ones assuming ideal mixing of the indoor air. The real-room scenarios show a slower particle decay than the predicted ones assuming ideal mixing of the indoor air. The experiments reported in this contribution demonstrate, that indoor air filters, operated with a filtration rate of 3.5 h?1 and positioned correctly, are capable to lower the particle concentration in all relevant size classes in real-world closed indoor environments slowly over time (e.g. a reduction in particle concentration of 50% after 30 min in a classroom w/o particle sources). In the investigated set-ups, at filtration rates above 9 h?1, the filters performance is close to cross-flow window-ventilation. The experiments reveal, that mobile air filters cannot avoid close distance transmission of submicron aerosols from one person to another. Therefore, they do not replace any of the well-known methods to avoid aerosol-driven infection (like wearing an efficient face mask correctly, limiting the number of people and time of stay in closed indoor environments, frequent ventilation). Mobile air filter devices may represent an additional component in an entire prevention strategy, especially when rooms cannot be ventilated regularly, efficiently or the constellation of people changes frequently (e.g. waiting areas).","output":"Simultaneous temporal, spatial and size-resolved measurements of aerosol particles in closed indoor environments applying mobile filters in various use-cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The logistics services industry will be significantly affected by future developments throughout the world.

The study of these iCOMs formation and their binding energy to the ASW, using computational chemistry, depends strongly on the ASW models used, as different models may exhibit sites with different adsorbing features. ASW extended models are rare in the literature because large sizes require very large computational resources when quantum mechanical methods based on DFT are used. To circumvent this problem, we propose to use the newly developed GFN-xTB Semi-empirical Quantum Mechanical (SQM) methods from the Grimmes group. These methods are, at least, two orders of magnitude faster than conventional DFT, only require modest central memory, and in this paper we aim to benchmark their accuracy against rigorous and resource hungry quantum mechanical methods. We focused on 38 water structures studied by MP2 and CCSD(T) approaches comparing energetic and structures with three levels of GFN-xTB parametrization (GFN0, GFN1, GFN2) methods.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac muscle disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy that can cause symptoms that are typically categorized into those from heart failure, chest pain, or arrhythmias. HCM is rarely associated with AV blocks with few case reports describing a connection. We will present a case of second degree AV block Mobitz Type I known as Wenckebach block secondary to HCM. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 63-year-old woman with no significant past medical history reporting to the hospital for substernal chest pressure and lightheadedness. She was found to have symptomatic second degree AV block Mobitz Type I and was scheduled for dual chamber pacemaker. Prior to pacemaker implantation, echocardiogram was obtained that was concerning for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left and right heart catheterization was performed that showed no significant coronary artery disease or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI was performed that showed features concerning for HCM. The patient underwent successful implantation of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) with improvement in symptoms. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 related limitations, further work up of HCM has been delayed including genetic testing. DISCUSSION: Wenckebach block is typically caused by myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, iatrogenic or cardiomyopathy of amyloidosis or sarcoidosis etiology. There is sparse literature discussing HCM causing first degree and complete heart block. Wenckebach block caused by HCM is very rare with only one other significant case found discussing the association. Once Wenckebach is discovered, a thorough work up for the underlying cause must be completed. In our case further work up via echocardiogram and cardiac MRI revealed HCM allowing for appropriate intervention with implantation of an AICD. CONCLUSIONS: Wenckebach block is rarely caused by HCM, but if obvious causes have been ruled out including myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, or iatrogenic then further work up is required. Cardiac imaging including echocardiogram and possibly cardiac MRI may be warranted to determine the underlying cause of the heart block, allowing for appropriate treatment. HCM is a rare cause of Wenckebach block, but must be considered on the differential diagnosis. REFERENCE #1: Wong TC.

The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. RESULTS: Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range: 8-40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62  4.44. The term 'health risk stress' refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health, and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all seven questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.","output":"Factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China: an extended information-motivation-behaviour skills model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To analyse the outcomes of patients who underwent elective ENT surgery during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in a COVID free site.

Data extraction followed categories used by WHO COVID-19 pulse surveys and operational guidelines on maintaining essential health services during COVID-19. FINDINGS: The search yielded 1101 articles, of which 369 fulfilled eligibility criteria, describing data from 210,419 participants, being adults (81%), children (11.4%) or both (7.3%). Included articles reported data from 105 countries and territories covering all WHO regions and World Bank income levels (low income: 1.9%, lower middle: 24.7%, upper middle: 29.5% and high income; 44.8%). Cross-sectoral services for neurological disorders were most frequently disrupted (62.9%), followed by emergency/acute care (47.1%). The degree of disruption was at least moderate for 75% of studies. Travel restrictions due to lockdowns (81.7%) and regulatory closure of services (65.4%) were the most commonly reported causes of disruption. Authors most frequently described telemedicine (82.1%) and novel dispensing approaches for medicines (51.8%) as mitigation strategies. Evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is largely missing. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of neurological care. Given the worldwide prevalence of neurological disorders and the potential long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19, service disruptions are devastating.

Iran was one of the first countries outside China to be affected in a major way and is now under the spell of a fourth wave. This study aims to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in north-eastern Iran through mapping the spatiotemporal trend of the disease. METHODS: The study comprises data of 4000 patients diagnosed by laboratory assays or clinical investigation from the beginning of the disease on Feb 14, 2020, until May 11, 2020. Epidemiological features and spatiotemporal trends of the disease in the study area were explored by classical statistical approaches and Geographic Information Systems. RESULTS: Most common symptoms were dyspnoea (69.4%), cough (59.4%), fever (54.4%) and weakness (19.5%). Approximately 82% of those who did not survive suffered from dyspnoea. The highest Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was related to those with cardiovascular disease (27.9%) and/or diabetes (18.1%). Old age (60 years) was associated with an almost five-fold increased CFR. Odds Ratio (OR) showed malignancy (3.8), nervous diseases (2.2), and respiratory diseases (2.2) to be significantly associated with increased CFR with developments, such as hospitalization at the ICU (2.9) and LOS (1.1) also having high correlations. Furthermore, spatial analyses revealed a geographical pattern in terms of both incidence and mortality rates, with COVID-19 first being observed in suburban areas from where the disease swiftly spread into downtown reaching a peak between 25 February to 06 March (4 incidences per km(2)). Mortality peaked 3 weeks later after which the infection gradually decreased. Out of patients investigated by the spatiotemporal approach (n = 727), 205 (28.2%) did not survive and 66.8% of them were men. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults and people with severe co-morbidities were at higher risk for developing serious complications due to COVID-19. Applying spatiotemporal methods to identify the transmission trends and high-risk areas can rapidly be documented, thereby assisting policymakers in designing and implementing tailored interventions to control and prevent not only COVID-19 but also other rapidly spreading epidemics/pandemics.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics and initial spatiotemporal visualisation of COVID-19 in a major city in the Middle East"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Examine the psychosocial adjustment of U.S. college and university students during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Follow-up ranged from 1 to 87 months. The patients were operated on at both St Joseph's Health Centre (a community hospital) and The Cumberland Clinic (private practice) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All patients undergoing an incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris were eligible. Participants' ages ranged from 3 to 55 years, with the majority being adults. Seventy patients were followed up for outcomes. INTERVENTIONS Incisionless otoplasty. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number and type of sutures used, perioperative complications, and postoperative follow-up including complications and revisions. Complications included infection, hematoma, bleeding, perichondritis, suture granuloma, suture exposure, and suture failure. RESULTS A mean (SD) 2.5 (0.8) sutures were used in the left ear, 2.48 (0.75) in the right ear, and 4.69 (1.75) in total. The number of sutures used in the left vs right ear was not significantly different (P = .60). All patients had horizontal mattress sutures placed for correction of prominauris. There were no serious perioperative complications such as infection, bleeding, hematoma, perichondritis, or cartilage necrosis. Follow-up data were extracted and analyzed in 70 patients, with a mean follow-up time of 31 months. Complications were seen in 10 patients (14%): 4 were due to suture failure, 3 were due to suture exposure, 2 were due to granuloma formation, and 1 was due to a Polysporin (bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate) reaction. Nine patients (13%) needed a revision to achieve a desirable result.

METHODS Four ANs were dissected combining the deltopectoral approach-medial to the CJ (A), the deltopectoral approach-lateral to the CJT (B) and the axillary approach (C) in 3 sequences: A-B-C, B-A-C, and C-B-A. After the first approach was completed, the proximal and distal margins were marked. Additional exposure with the second and third approaches and the 6 o'clock position were also marked. Then, the AN was excised and the amount of exposed nerve with the 3 approaches was measured. RESULTS The deltopectoral approach-medial to the conjoint tendon did not allow exposure of the AN at the 6 o'clock position. Six o'clock position exposure was accomplished using the lateral interval of the deltopectoral and the axillary approaches. A deltopectoral approach lateral to the CJT allowed exploration of the AN at the blind spot, but not the terminal branches. The axillary approach was able to expose the AN at the 6 o'clock position, the terminal branches, but not the nerve-muscle junction. Combining the 3 approaches exposed 81% to 94% of the total length of the AN.

How clinical characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly presented.Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases.

This study investigates the pandemic's potential impact on adults' suicide ideation. METHODS: We compared self-reported suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 by analyzing data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (11 September to 4 December 2020) and the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which populations were at higher risk of suicide ideation during the pandemic. RESULTS: The percentage of adults reporting suicide ideation since the pandemic began (2.44%) was not significantly different from the percentage reporting suicide ideation in the past 12 months in 2019 (2.73%). Significant differences in the prevalence of recent suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 also tended to be absent in the numerous sociodemographic groups we examined. Risk factors of reporting suicide ideation during the pandemic included being under 65 years, Canadian-born or a frontline worker; reporting pandemic-related income/job loss or loneliness/isolation; experiencing a lifetime highly stressful/traumatic event; and having lower household income and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Evidence of changes in suicide ideation due to the pandemic were generally not observed in this research.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of month-to-month trends on waitlist additions, waitlist deaths, and transplant surgeries between all United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions was performed. A linear regression model trained on historical data was used to estimate anticipated transplantation volume. RESULTS: All UNOS regions reported a decrease in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries. The largest decreases in total transplants were identified in regions 1, 2, 6, and 9, with regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 noting the largest decrease in waitlist additions. Six of the 11 regions noted increases in waitlist deaths, with UNOS regions 9, 1, and 2, all located within the Northeast, noting the highest percent increase in waitlist deaths at 170%, 89%, and 54%, respectively. The largest reductions in solid organ transplantation and waitlist deaths were seen in kidney and lung transplantation. Current transplantation volume is significantly lower than the low range of the 95% confidence interval derived from the linear regression model (2182 versus 3110; P < 0.05).

The delivery of cardiovascular care has been stifled during the pandemic to adhere to infection control measures as a way of protecting patients and the workforce at large. This cautious approach has been protective since individuals with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are anticipated to have poorer outcomes and an increased risk of death. The combination of postponing elective cardiovascular surgeries, reduced acute care and long-term cardiac damage directly resulting from COVID-19 will likely have increased the demand for cardiac care, particularly from patients presenting with more severe symptoms. The combination of increased demand and inhibited supply will likely result in huge backlog of unmet patients' needs. The novelty, virulence and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, thus necessitating modifications to the UK government's healthcare strategy. Without improving cost efficiency, the UK's ageing population will likely need an increasing spend on cardiac surgery simply to maintain the same level of service.

While it offers a series of advantages attracting considerable attention, the fundamental mechanism and improvement strategies for EDT approach are being endeavored extensively with the aid of new material explorations. An interesting phenomenon observed in early studies is that the on-site concentration of chloride ion is highly favored for the induction of oxidative species and the efficacy of tumor inhibition. Following this discovery ignored previously, here for the first time, fine Pt/Cu alloy nanoparticles (PtCu(3) NPs) are integrated with chloride ion transporter (CIT) for EDT-based combinational therapy. In this system, while PtCu(3) NPs induce oxidative species under an electric field, it also effectively transforms endogenous H(2)O(2) into ?OH and consumes intracellular glutathione (GSH). More importantly, with the aid of CIT, PtCu(3)-PEG@CIT NPs promote the intracellular concentration of chloride ion (Cl(?)) by transporting extracellular Cl(?), facilitating the generation of oxidative species considerably. Meanwhile, CIT delivered intracellularly increases lysosomal pH, leading to the disruption of cellular autophagy and weakening the treatment resistance.

We hypothesized that convalescent plasma would improve outcomes for critically ill adult patients with Covid-19. METHODS In an ongoing adaptive platform trial, critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19, defined as receiving intensive care-level organ support, were randomized to open-label convalescent plasma or not (i.e., control group). The primary end point was organ support-free days (i.e., days alive and free of ICU-based organ support) up to day 21. The primary analysis was a Bayesian cumulative logistic model with predefined criteria for superiority or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both. RESULTS The convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after pre-specified criteria for futility were met. At that time, 1084 participants had been randomized to convalescent plasma and 916 to no convalescent plasma (control). The median organ support-free days were 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) for the convalescent plasma group and 3 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) days for the control group. The median adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.97 (95% credible interval 0.83 to 1.15) and posterior probability of futility (OR < 1.2) was 99.4% for convalescent plasma compared to control. In-hospital mortality was 37.3% (401/1075) in convalescent plasma group, and 38.4% (347/904) in controls. The observed treatment effects were consistent across primary and secondary outcomes.

We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEi/ARB and the outcome of COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension in non-endemic areas. Methods: From January 17, 2020, to February 19, 2020, 286 patients with hypertension were enrolled in this retrospective study out of 1,437 COVID-19 patients from 47 centers in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Province. The composite endpoints consisted of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to assess the association between ACEi/ARB and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Results: In the main analysis, 103 patients receiving ACEi/ARB were compared with 173 patients receiving other regimens. Overall, 44 patients (15.94%) had an endpoint event. The risk probability of crude endpoints in the ACEi/ARB group (12.62%) was lower than that in the non-ACEi/ARB group (17.92%).

Most of the current solutions depend on reliable data, deterministic rules, or the similarity of patients, while studies have shown otherwise. To this end, in this paper, we have extended our previous work on the Hapicare framework to integrate probabilistic diagnosis and self-adaptive treatment. Our new framework enables sensors datastream analysis and online decision-making. Its ontology-based reasoning uses Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) ontology to add contextual information to the collected data. Moreover, probabilistic reasoning is applied for diagnosis and screening to manage the uncertainty and unreliability of data as well as the indeterministic medical rules. The treatment system is designed to be modifiable by the experts and automatically adaptable to patients needs.

In developing nations such as Jordan, appreciable impacts on healthcare delivery ensued owing to limited resources. As a result, managing chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) has been modified to accommodate altercations in the system. This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on managing patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) during the lockdown. METHODS: Objectives were accomplished by retrieving records of clinical data and perioperative results for patients diagnosed with CLTI at King Abdullah University Hospital between March 17 and June 1, 2020. Patients demographics, Rutherford classification, type of intervention, and intervention variables during the outbreak were retrospectively analyzed (pandemic Group A) and compared with patients from the same period last year (control Group B). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with CLTI were included in the study; Groups A and B consisted of 28 and 68 patients, respectively. The mean ages for Groups A and B were 62.8 and 60.2 years, respectively. Conservative management was applied to 53.6% (P < 0.01) of Group A patients, whereas endovascular revascularization was the primary approach in Group B (39.7%, P < 0.01). After the intervention, the majority of patients in Group A were classified as category six on the Rutherford classification system (46.4%, P < 0.01), whereas the majority in group B were classified as category five (55.9%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The more unsatisfactory outcome of CLTI during the pandemic entails substantial measures to ensure conscientious virtual encounters and ambulatory community-based services during current and future pandemics. The endovascular-first policy should be endorsed in future pandemics as it is better at reducing aerosol transmission than standard surgical intervention. Moreover, endovascular procedures are minimally invasive and associated with favorable outcomes when medical optimization and hospital beds are limited.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia in Northern Jordan: Case series and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is more transmissible than previous coronaviruses and causes a more serious illness than influenza. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a prelude to viral entry into the cell. Using a naive llama single-domain antibody library and PCR-based maturation, we have produced two closely related nanobodies, H11-D4 and H11-H4, that bind RBD (KD of 39 and 12 nM, respectively) and block its interaction with ACE2. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed that both nanobodies bind to all three RBDs in the spike trimer. Crystal structures of each nanobody-RBD complex revealed how both nanobodies recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface, explaining the blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction. Nanobody-Fc fusions showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (4-6 nM for H11-H4, 18 nM for H11-D4) and additive neutralization with the SARS-CoV-1/2 antibody CR3022.","output":"Neutralizing nanobodies bind SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and block interaction with ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider the problem of estimating the reproduction number $R_t$ of an epidemic for populations where the probability of detection of cases depends on a known covariate.

However, it is not known if such practices can change the clinical course in infected individuals. METHODS: We prospectively studied an outbreak of COVID-19 in Switzerland among a population of 508 predominantly male soldiers with a median age of 21 years. We followed the number of infections in two spatially separated cohorts with almost identical baseline characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before and after implementation of stringent social distancing. RESULTS: Of the 354 soldiers infected prior to the implementation of social distancing, 30% fell ill from COVID-19. While no soldier in a group of 154, in which infections appeared after implementation of social distancing, developed COVID-19 despite the detection of viral RNA in the nose and virus-specific antibodies within this group. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing not only can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of young, healthy adults but can also prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 while still inducing an immune response and colonizing nasal passages.

METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases and grey literature using terms related to conflict, population, and nutrition. We searched studies on women and children receiving nutrition-specific interventions during or within five years of a conflict in LMICs. We extracted information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics, as well as delivery barriers and facilitators. Data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS Ninety-one pubblications met our inclusion criteria. Nearly half of the publications (n=43) included population of sub-Saharan Africa (n=31) followed by Middle East and North African region. Most publications (n=58) reported on interventions targeting children under 5 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women (n=27). General food distribution (n=34), micronutrient supplementation (n=27) and nutrition assessment (n=26) were the most frequently reported interventions, with most reporting on intervention delivery to refugee populations in camp settings (n=63) and using community-based approaches. Only eight studies reported on coverage and effectiveness of intervention. Key delivery facilitators included community advocacy and social mobilisation, effective monitoring and the integration of nutrition, and other sectoral interventions and services, and barriers included insufficient resources, nutritional commodity shortages, security concerns, poor reporting, limited cooperation, and difficulty accessing and following-up of beneficiaries. DISCUSSION Despite the focus on nutrition in conflict settings, our review highlights important information gaps. Moreover, there is very little information on coverage or effectiveness of nutrition interventions; more rigorous evaluation of effectiveness and delivery approaches is needed, including outside of camps and for preventive as well as curative nutrition interventions.

The national lockdown measures in China during COVID-19 were found to lead to abrupt changes in ambient surface air quality, but indoor air quality changes were neglected. In this study, we aim to investigate the impacts of lockdown measures on both ambient and household air pollution as well as the short-term health effects of air pollution changes. METHODS: In this study, an up-to-date emission inventory from January to March 2020 in China was developed based on air quality observations in combination with emission-concentration response functions derived from chemical transport modeling. These emission inventories, together with the emissions data from 2017 to 2019, were fed into the state-of-the-art regional chemistry transport model to simulate the air quality in the North China Plain. A hypothetical scenario assuming no lockdown effects in 2020 was also performed to determine the effects of the lockdown on air quality in 2020. A difference-to-difference approach was adopted to isolate the effects on air quality due to meteorological conditions and long-term decreasing emission trends by comparing the PM(2.5) changes during lockdown to those before lockdown in 2020 and in previous years (2017C2019). The short-term premature mortality changes from both ambient and household PM(2.5) changes were quantified based on two recent epidemiological studies, with uncertainty of urban and rural population migration considerations. FINDINGS: The national lockdown measures during COVID-19 led to a reduction of 5.1 g m(?3) in ambient PM(2.5) across the North China Plain (NCP) from January 25th to March 5th compared with the hypothetical simulation with no lockdown measures. However, a difference-to-difference method showed that the daily domain average PM(2.5) in the NCP decreased by 9.7 g m(?3) between lockdown periods before lockdown in 2020, while it decreased by 7.9 g m(?3) during the same periods for the previous three-year average from 2017 to 2019, demonstrating that lockdown measures may only have caused a 1.8 g m(?3) decrease in the NCP. We then found that the integrated population-weighted PM(2.5), including both ambient and indoor PM(2.5) exposure, increased by 5.1 g m(?3) during the lockdown periods compared to the hypothetical scenario, leading to additional premature deaths of 609 (95% CI: 415C775) to 2,860 (95% CI: 1,436C4,273) in the short term, depending on the relative risk chosen from the epidemiological studies. INTERPRETATION: Our study indicates that lockdown measures in China led to abrupt reductions in ambient PM(2.5) concentration but also led to significant increases in indoor PM(2.5) exposure due to confined indoor activities and increased usages of household fuel for cooking and heating. We estimated that hundreds of premature deaths were added as a combination of decreased ambient PM(2.5) and increased household PM(2.5). Our findings suggest that the reduction in ambient PM(2.5) was negated by increased exposure to household air pollution, resulting in an overall increase in integrated population weighted exposure. Although lockdown measures were instrumental in reducing the exposure to pollution concentration in cities, rural areas bore the brunt, mainly due to the use of dirty solid fuels, increased population density due to the large-scale migration of people from urban to rural areas during the Chinese New Year and long exposure time to HAP due to restrictions in outdoor movement.","output":"Non-negligible contributions to human health from increased household air pollution exposure during the COVID-19 lockdown in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repair of medial meniscus posterior root tear (MMPRT) is considered as an effective early intervention strategy for osteoarthritis.

The present study investigated the effects of Mg++ supplementation on preventing CS-induced muscle atrophy in an animal model, which provided experimental data for potential clinical translation. METHODS: Twelve 24-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS methylprednisolone (MPS) to induce muscle atrophy, with half of the rats also given daily 50 mg/kg Mg++ oral supplementation. Additional six rats without LPS + CS treatments were used as normal controls. After treatment for 6 weeks, serum was collected for Mg++ quantification, animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for tissue composition, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was collected for muscle functional test and histology including muscle fiber size, intramuscular fat infiltration and fiber typing. In vitro myotube atrophy model was used to study the in vitro effect associated with in vivo muscle atrophy. RESULTS: LPS + CS treatments induced hypomagnesemia while the serum Mg++ level was in normal range after Mg++ supplementation. DXA showed 53.0% lower fat percent and 29.7% higher lean mass in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Muscle functional test showed 22.2% higher specific twitch force and 40.3% higher specific tetanic force in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of muscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that Mg++ supplementation group had larger myotube diameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in Mg++ supplementation group both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that Mg++ supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy.

The primary outcome was CLABSI. Secondary endpoints included total positive blood cultures, acquisition of resistant organisms, and acquisition of cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with an elevated CHG mean inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: The study was stopped early because of poor accrual. Among the 177 enrolled patients, 174 were considered as evaluable (88 were randomized to the CHG group and 86 were randomized to the control group).

Post-hoc analysis indicated that COVID-19 perceived stress was associated with an increased likelihood of clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity at higher levels of anxiety sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides support for the role of anxiety sensitivity in identifying individuals at risk for clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity.","output":"Anxiety Sensitivity Moderates the Impact of COVID-19 Perceived Stress on Anxiety and Functional Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

On the one hand, population dynamics influence the environment and the global climate system through consumption-based carbon emissions. On the other hand, health and wellbeing of the population is already being affected by climate change. The knowledge on population dynamics and population heterogeneity thus is fundamental in improving our understanding of how population size, composition and distribution influence global environmental change and how these changes affect subgroups of population differentially by demographic characteristics and spatial distribution. Existing theoretical concepts and methodological tools in demography can be readily applied to the study of population and global environmental change. In the past couple of decades, demographic research has enriched climate change research both in the analysis of the impact of population dynamics on the global climate system as well as the impact of climate change on human population. What is missing in the literature is the study that investigates how global environmental change affect current and future demographic processes and consequently population trends. If global environmental change does influence fertility, mortality and migration, the three key demographic components underlying population change, population estimates and forecast need to adjust from the climate feedback in population projections.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients with immune-related kidney diseases treated with at least one course of RTX between 2015 and 2019. As a part of the ABCDE Registry, detailed data on RTX application and SI were collected. SI were defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 as infectious complications grade 3 and above. Patients were dichotomized between nephrotic and nephritic indications. The primary outcome was the incidence of SI within 12 months after the first RTX application. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were included. Twenty-five patients (17.4%) presented with SI, mostly within the first 3 months after RTX administration. Most patients in the nephritic group had ANCA-associated vasculitis, while membranous nephropathy was the leading entity in the nephrotic group. Respiratory infections were the leading SI (n= 10, 40%), followed by urinary tract (n=3, 12%) and gastrointestinal infections (n=2, 8%). On multivariable analysis, body mass index (BMI, 24.6 kg/m(2) versus 26.9 kg/m(2), HR: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.79-0.99; p=0.039) and baseline creatinine (HR: 1.25; 95%CI: 1.04-1.49; p=0.017) were significantly associated with SI. All patients in the nephritic group (n=19; 100%) who experienced a SI received oral glucocorticoid (GC) treatment at the time of infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia was frequent (58.5%) but not associated with SI. CONCLUSIONS: After RTX administration, impaired kidney function and lower BMI are independent risk factors for SI.

Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill.The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We developed Hopewell Hospitalist, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of Hopewell Hospitalist for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing Hopewell Hospitalist for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase.

Recently, we described a high incidence of inter-individual regional heterogeneity in terms of asymmetry of plaque burden and microglial activation in ?-amyloid mouse models of AD as assessed by positron-emission-tomography (PET). We now investigate the regional associations between amyloid plaque burden, microglial activation, and impaired spatial learning performance in transgenic mice in vivo. METHODS: In 30 AppNL-G-F mice (15 female, 15 male) we acquired cross-sectional 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO-PET, 18F-GE-180) and ?-amyloid-PET (18F-florbetaben) scans at ten months of age. Control data were obtained from age- and sex-matched C57BI/6 wild-type mice. We assessed spatial learning (i.e. Morris water maze) within two weeks of PET scanning and correlated the principal component of spatial learning performance scores with voxel-wise ?-amyloid and TSPO tracer uptake maps in AppNL-G-F mice, controlled for age and sex. In order to assess the effects of hemispheric asymmetry, we also analyzed correlations of spatial learning performance with tracer uptake in bilateral regions of interest for frontal cortex, entorhinal/piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, using a regression model. We tested the correlation between regional asymmetry of PET biomarkers with individual spatial learning performance. RESULTS: Voxel-wise analyses in AppNL-G-F mice revealed that higher TSPO-PET signal in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus correlated with spatial learning performance. Region-based analysis showed significant correlations between TSPO expression in the right entorhinal/piriform cortex and the right amygdala and spatial learning performance, whereas there were no such correlations in the left hemisphere. Right lateralized TSPO expression in the amygdala predicted better performance in the Morris water maze (?a?=a?-0.470, pa?=a?0.013), irrespective of the global microglial activation and amyloid level. Region-based results for amyloid-PET showed no significant associations with spatial learning. CONCLUSION: Elevated microglial activation in the right amygdala-entorhinal-hippocampal complex of AppNL-G-F mice is associated with better spatial learning. Our findings support a protective role of microglia on cognitive function when they highly express TSPO in specific brain regions involved in spatial memory.","output":"Microglial Activation in the Right Amygdala-Entorhinal-Hippocampal Complex is Associated with Preserved Spatial Learning in AppNL-G-F mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the world is in the initial phase of the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, and the vaccine is principally available to developed countries, that is mainly administered to older people, especially to health workers at high risk of contracting COVID-19 while the rest of the population are exposed to contagion.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with Nb6, VHH E and bi-paratopic VHH VE nanobodies. We combined atomistic dynamics and collective motions analysis with binding free energy scanning, perturbation-response scanning and network centrality analysis to examine mechanisms of nanobody-induced allosteric modulation and cooperativity in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with these nanobodies. By quantifying energetic and allosteric determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with nanobodies, we also examined nanobody-induced modulation of escaping mutations and the effect of the Omicron variant on nanobody binding. The mutational scanning analysis supported the notion that E484A mutation can have a significant detrimental effect on nanobody binding and result in Omicron-induced escape from nanobody neutralization. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may exploit plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to binding without compromising activity. The network analysis supported these findings showing that VHH VE nanobody binding can induce long-range couplings between the cryptic binding epitope and ACE2-binding site through a broader ensemble of communication paths that is less dependent on specific mediating centers and therefore may be less sensitive to mutational perturbations of functional residues. The results suggest that binding affinity and long-range communications of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with nanobodies can be determined by structurally stable regulatory centers and conformationally adaptable hotspots that are allosterically coupled and collectively control resilience to mutational escape.","output":"Allosteric Determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding with Nanobodies: Examining Mechanisms of Mutational Escape and Sensitivity of the Omicron Variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a plethora of inequalities in South Africa.

Methods An online cross-sectional survey was administered from October to November 2020 involving people who were living in Seoul, aged 19 years or above, under a 2-week mandatory quarantine. Their mental health status was measured using the Patient Health Questionnares-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Overall, 1,135 respondents were finally included, resulting in a 22.0% response rate. After controlling for potential confounders, variables, such as the second half of quarantine period (OR = 1.78 95% CI: 1.10C2.88), female (OR = 1.91 95% CI: 1.16C3.16), and having pre-existing depression (OR = 8.03 95% CI: 2.96C21.78) were significantly associated with depression while being quarantined. Those with correct knowledge about the rationale behind for the quarantine (OR = 0.39 95% CI: 0.21C0.72), an understanding of quarantine rules (OR = 0.68 95%CI: 0.52C0.91), and those who felt supported by others (OR = 0.74 95% CI: 0.55C0.99) were less likely to develop depression while quarantining.

However, questions have arisen about how to manage emergency situations, such as when thrombolysis would be required for acute ischemic stroke or for the managing intracranial or gastrointestinal bleedings. We summarize the current literature and provide recommendations for the management of these situations. Peak plasma levels of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban are observed about 2-4 h after intake. Elimination of dabigatran is mainly dependent on renal function. Consequently, if renal function is impaired, there is a risk of drug accumulation that is highest for dabigatran followed by rivaroxaban and then apixaban and thus dosing recommendations are different. To date, no bedside tests are available that reliably assess the anticoagulatory effect of DOACs, nor are specific antidotes available. We recommend performing the following tests if DOAC intake is unknown: dabigatran-associated bleeding risk is minimized or can be neglected if thrombin time, Hemoclot test, or Ecarin clotting time is normal. Apixaban and rivaroxaban effects can be ruled out if findings from the anti-factor Xa activity test are normal. High plasma levels of DOAC are also mostly excluded if PTT and PTZ are normal four or more hours after DOAC intake. However, normal values of global coagulation tests are not sufficient if thrombolysis is indicated for treating acute stroke. The decision for or against thrombolysis is an individual decision; in these cases, thrombolysis use is off-label. In case of bleeding, prothrombin complex concentrates seems to be the most plausible treatment. For severe gastrointestinal bleeding with life-threatening blood loss, the bleeding source needs to be identified and treated by invasive measures. Use of procoagulant drugs (antifibrinolytics) might also be considered. However, there is very limited clinical experience with these products in conjunction with DOAC.","output":"Recommendations for the emergency management of complications associated with the new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine remains high among the US population.

In murine hepatitis virus (MHV), nsps 1, 2, and 3 are processed by two papain-like proteinase activities within nsp3 (PLP1 and PLP2) to yield nsp1, an nsp2-3 intermediate, and mature nsp2 and nsp3. To determine the role in replication of processing between nsp2 and nsp3 at cleavage site 2 (CS2) and PLP1 proteinase activity, mutations were engineered into the MHV genome at CS2, at CS1 and CS2, and at the PLP1 catalytic site, alone and in combination. Mutant viruses with abolished cleavage at CS2 were delayed in growth and RNA synthesis but grew to wild-type titers of >10(7) PFU/ml. Mutant viruses with deletion of both CS1 and CS2 exhibited both a delay in growth and a decrease in peak viral titer to approximately 10(4) PFU/ml. Inactivation of PLP1 catalytic residues resulted in a mutant virus that did not process at either CS1 or CS2 and was severely debilitated in growth, achieving only 10(2) PFU/ml. However, when both CS1 and CS2 were deleted in the presence of inactivated PLP1, the growth of the resulting mutant virus was partially compensated, comparable to that of the CS1 and CS2 deletion mutant. These results demonstrate that interactions of PLP1 with CS1 and CS2 are critical for protein processing and suggest that the interactions play specific roles in regulation of the functions of nsp1, 2, and 3 in viral RNA synthesis.","output":"Replication of murine hepatitis virus is regulated by papain-like proteinase 1 processing of nonstructural proteins 1, 2, and 3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of work-integrated learning (WIL) has been significant, with many active WIL activities pivoting to remote offerings where students engage with the workplace through online platforms from their homes The pandemic has also caused significant and ongoing disruption to the economy, likely causing less work placement opportunities for upcoming years within the context of limited institutional budgets and resourcing It is, therefore, vitally important that institutions develop diverse practices of WIL and shift away from a heavy reliance on work placements Developing diverse WIL practices across educational institutions is an important strategy to build 'institutional WIL resilience' during times of disrupted economies with limited WIL opportunities During the pandemic, the use of simulations had increased, in particular, in relation to preparing students for WIL, however, caution is needed in considering simulations as a comparable alternative to WIL","output":"Responding to an international crisis: The adaptability of the practice of work-integrated learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the epidemic evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the issues of mutation, origin, typing and the effect of mutation on molecular detection remain to be unrevealed.

The effect of different operational factors such as pH, catalyst dosage, phenol concentration, and light illumination was investigated to find the optimum decontamination conditions. According to the results, complete degradation of phenol was achieved at pH = 4, catalyst dosage of 0.6 g L-1, light intensity of 150 W, and phenol initial concentration of 60 ppm at 160 min under visible light illumination. With the addition of graphene oxide to the composite, a significant increase was detected in the photocatalytic performance due to the higher available surface area and lower electron/hole recombination rate. In addition, the scavenging experiments revealed that the OH is responsible for the degradation of phenol during the reaction. The degradation mechanism, economic performance, mineralization, and recyclability were also investigated. Kinetic studies confirmed that photocatalytic degradation process followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. A case of real wastewater treatment was used to examine the performance of the catalyst for real case studies.","output":"Photocatalytic decontamination of phenol and petrochemical wastewater through ZnO/TiO2 decorated on reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite: influential operating factors, mechanism, and electrical energy consumption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Among food pantry users there is a high prevalence of both smoking and food insecurity, which may be related to one another. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a smoking cessation program carried out in food pantries on the smoking status and the food security status of food pantry users. METHODS / DESIGN: Before starting the cluster randomised controlled trial, stakeholders will be engaged to adapt a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation to the needs of the food pantry users in a pre study. Food pantry users and workers as well as other experts, such as smoking cessation trainers, social workers, and psychologists, will be involved, using the world caf technique and telephone interviews and a qualitative thematic analysis for data analysis to design the concept of the intervention program will be applied. In the second phase, the impact of the intervention on the smoking status and on food insecurity will be investigated by a cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 416 food pantry users across 32 clusters (food pantries) in Berlin, Germany, should be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the waiting list control group. The intervention will consist of a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation, specially tailored for food pantry users, as well as optional nicotine replacement therapy and the implementation of environmental smoking reduction measures in the food pantries. The primary outcomes 6 months after the treatment will be self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (< 10 ppm of carbon monoxide), and increased food security level (the percentage of participants with an improved food security level). DISCUSSION: This study will be the first long-term investigation into the effect of a smoking cessation program on smoking status and food insecurity.

Patient characteristics, RR practices, and hospital context and/or mechanism influence post-RR outcomes. We aim to describe and compare RR function and outcomes within our institution's multiple sites. METHODS We conducted a 3-year retrospective study to compare RR use, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between our hospital's central campus (CC) and 2 satellite campuses (SCs). RR training and procedures are uniform across all campuses. RESULTS Among the 2935 RRs reviewed, 1816 occurred during index admissions at the CC and 405 occurred at SCs. CC, when compared with SCs, had higher age at RR (3.2 years vs 1.4 years), prevalence of complex chronic conditions (62.4% vs 34.4%), surgical complications (20.2% vs 5%), severity of illness, and risk of mortality (P < .001). CC had higher daytime RR activations, longer time from admission to RR, and more activations by nurses (P < .001). Respiratory diagnoses were most prevalent uniformly, but cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic diagnoses were higher at CC (P < .001). Cardiac and/or respiratory arrests during RR and transfers to the ICU were similar. Cardiorespiratory interventions post-RR, hospital length of stay, and mortality were higher and ICU stay was shorter (P < .01) in the CC. Outcomes were mainly affected by patient characteristics and not RR factors on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patient illness severity, RR characteristics, and outcomes are significantly different in our multisite locations. Outcomes are predominantly affected by patient severity and not RR characteristics.

Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating &#945;-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia.

Simulation modelling enables estimation of outcomes for a range of scenarios. In this study, we estimate the impact of various disruptions and recovery strategies for the Australian biennial mammographic breast screening program (BreastScreen). METHOD Policy1-Breast is a continuous-time, multiple-cohort micro-simulation model that simulates the whole Australian female population, incorporating breast cancer risk and natural history, breast density, menopause, hormone therapy use and breast cancer screening. Firstly, in the early stages of the COVID pandemic we used Policy1-Breast to evaluate how 3, 6, 9 and 12-month pauses to BreastScreen would impact on population-level breast cancer diagnoses, tumour staging, and breast cancer survival, compared to business-as-usual (BAU) outcomes. Secondly, to explore options for recovery after an actual one-month screening pause in April 2020, we evaluated a range of assumed throughput levels following screening resumption (50% or 80% up to December, then 100% to 120% from Jan 2021), comparing various protocols where specific sub-groups of clients were prioritised for screening during the recovery Speriod. Outcomes are reported for the target age range for the BreastScreen program (50-74 years). RESULTS For 3-to 12-month pauses, we estimated a slight reduction in 5-year survival following diagnosis for women directly affected by a pause, but no discernible changes to population-level breast cancer mortality rates up to 2023. We estimated marked fluctuations in population rates of invasive breast cancer diagnoses with a 10% increase in cancer diagnoses between 2020-2021 and 2022-2023. For a 12-month pause to screening we estimate that population-level breast cancers would increase in size (with an additional 4% >15mm at diagnosis) and be more likely to involve the nodes (increasing from 26% to 30% of all cancers). We estimate that median screening intervals during 2020-2021 would increase from 104 weeks under BAU up to 130 weeks with a 12-month pause, and BreastScreen recall rates and false positive recall rates would fluctuate markedly over time. For the second evaluation of a one-month pause followed by various throughput and prioritisation scenarios, we estimated that screen-detected cancer rates would vary markedly with throughput but interval cancer rates would not, leading to fluctuations in program sensitivity of up to 6%. Reflecting the periodic nature of screening participation, we estimated the extent to which longer-term future screening participation rates are expected echo the peaks and troughs in participation due to the impacts of the COVID pandemic in 2020. We estimate that for a given throughput assumption, client prioritisation could lead to different rescreening rates, screening intervals, and time required for prioritisation protocols, with little change to cancer outcomes. CONCLUSION These modelled evaluations estimate short and longer-term effects of COVID-19 on the impact of population breast cancer screening in Australia. The estimated changes in breast cancer rates and characteristics would be expected to have a flow-on effect on the demand for treatment services in terms of throughput and case-mix. Preparing for such outcomes is critical given that treatment services are also directly impacted by the pandemic. The modelled outcomes are likely to be relevant to other high-income settings with established population breast cancer screening programs.","output":"The estimated impact of COVID-19 on population breast cancer screening outcomes, and options for risk-based recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": The Expert Panel on Effective ways of investing in health (EXPH) is an interdisciplinary and independent group established by the European Commission to provide non-binding independent advice on matters related to effective, accessible and resilient health systems. In a prior opinion on resilient health and social care following the COVID-19 pandemic, the EXPH recommended that aggravated levels of psychological distress should be recognized as a public health priority. In January 2021, EXPH received a mandate to examine what is known about interventions to support the mental health needs of essential workers, with a particular emphasis on the health workforce. The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss the findings and recommendations from the Opinion on this matter. The value added offered by this workshop is three-fold. First, it offers a multidisciplinary perspective on the mental health of the health force. Second, its findings on promising and/or effective interventions are evidence-based. Third, it provides a pan-European consensus opinion on a path forward towards providing support to this vulnerable group at multiple levels - from European and national policy to senior managers to occupational and mental health practitioners. The workshop will consist of 4 5-to-10-minute presentations from EXPH members and Opinion collaborators. After the first two presentations, there will be a brief 7-minute reaction session with the audience. After the last presentation, 15-20 minutes will be spent engaging in interactive discussion between the workshop panel members and the audience using a series of prescribed discussion questions. In the first presentation, the chair of the Opinion will introduce the EXPH and its collaborators and provide an overview of the mandate. In the second presentation, the conceptual framework for responding to the questions posed by the European Commission and key determinants of mental health in the health workforce will be presented. The third presentation will describe cost-effective and promising interventions relative to mental health of the health workforce and then detail conditions for the cost-effective, affordable, and inclusive.

Of the 388 COVID-19-related deaths occurring nationwide, most occurred in the community. We report findings from COVID-19 mortality surveillance among community deaths brought to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) mortuary in Lusaka. MethodsIn Zambia, when a person dies in the community, and is brought into a health facility mortuary, they are recorded as brought in dead (BID). The UTH mortuary accepts persons BID for Lusaka District, the most populated district in Zambia. We analyzed data for persons BID at UTH during 2020. We analyzed two data sources: weekly SARS-CoV-2 test results for persons BID and monthly all-cause mortality numbers among persons BID. For all-cause mortality among persons BID, monthly deaths during 2020 that were above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the historic mean (2017-2019) were considered significant. Spearmans rank test was used to correlate the overall percent positivity in Zambia with all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing among persons BID at UTH mortuary. ResultsDuring 2020, 7,756 persons were BID at UTH (monthly range 556-810). SARS-CoV-2 testing began in April 2020, and through December 3,131 (51.9%) of 6,022 persons BID were tested. Of these, 212 (6.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with weekly percent test positivity ranging from 0-32%, with the highest positivity occurring during July 2020. There were 1,139 excess persons BID from all causes at UTH mortuary in 2020 compared to the 2017-2019 mean. The monthly number of persons BID from all causes was above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval during June-September and December. ConclusionIncreases in all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among persons BID at UTH mortuary corresponded with the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in June and August 2020, indicating possible increased mortality related to the COVID-19 epidemic in Zambia. Combining all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing for persons BID provides useful information about the severity of the epidemic in Lusaka and should be implemented throughout Zambia.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Mortality Surveillance among Community Deaths brought to University Teaching Hospital Mortuary in Lusaka, Zambia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is raging.

SVA was originally identified as a cell culture contaminant and was not associated with disease until 2007 when it was first observed in pigs with Idiopathic Vesicular Disease (IVD). Vesicular disease is sporadically observed in swine, is not debilitating, but is significant due to its resemblance to foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), whose presence would be economically devastating to the United States. IVD disrupts swine production until foreign animal diseases can be ruled out. Identification and characterization of SVA as a cause of IVD will help to quickly rule out infection by foreign animal diseases. METHODS: We have developed and characterized an indirect ELISA assay to specifically identify serum antibodies to SVA. Viral protein 1, 2 and 3 (VP1, VP2, VP3) were expressed, isolated, and purified from E. coli and used to coat plates for an indirect ELISA. Sera from pigs with and without IVD symptoms as well as a time course following animals from an infected farm, were analyzed to determine the antibody responses to VP1, VP2, and VP3. RESULTS: Antibody responses to VP2 were higher than VP1 and VP3 and showed high affinity binding on an avidity ELISA. ROC analysis of the SVA VP2 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 89.7%. Compared to IFA, the quantitative ELISA showed an 89% agreement in negative samples and positive samples from 4C60 days after appearance of clinical signs. Immune sera positive for FMDV, encephalomyocarditis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus antibodies did not cross-react.

There were significantly differences in ages (years old: 4313 vs. 5713), the proportion of patients with one chronic disease (17.7% vs. 55.6%), C-reactive protein [CRP (mg/L): 7.3 (2.3, 21.0) vs. 40.1 (18.8, 62.6)], lymphocyte count [LYM (109/L): 1.3 (1.0, 1.8) vs. 0.8 (0.7, 1.1)], the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio [NLR: 2.1 (1.6, 3.0) vs. 3.1 (2.2, 8.8)] and multilobularinltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension and age [MuLBSTA score: 5.0 (3.0, 5.0) vs. 5.0 (5.0, 7.0)] between mild/common group and severe/critical group (all P < 0.05). Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP, NLR, MuLBSTA score, age, and whether chronic diseases were associated with the severity of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.037 (1.020-1.055), 1.374 (1.123-1.680), 1.574 (1.296-1.911), 1.082 (1.042-1.125), 6.393 (2.551-16.023), respectively, all P < 0.01]. Further multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP and MuLBSTA score were risk factors for the development of COVID-19 to severe/critical cases [OR and 95%CI were 1.024 (1.002-1.048) and 1.321 (1.027-1.699) respectively, both P < 0.05]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for CRP and MuLBSTA score to predict severe/critical cases were both 0.818, and the best cut-off points were 27.4 mg/L and 6.0 points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and MuLBSTA score are related to the severity of COVID-19, and may have good independent predictive ability for the development of severe/critical illness.","output":"[Correlation between early inflammation indicators and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular immune responses play a key role in the control of viral infection. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major immunogenic protein that can induce protective immunity. To screen for potential T-cell epitopes on IBV N protein, forty overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. Four T-cell epitope peptides were identified by IFN- ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, and CFSE lymphocyte proliferation assays; among them, three peptides (N211-230, N271-290, and N381-400) were CTL epitopes, and one peptide (N261-280) was a dual-specific T-cell epitope, which can be recognized by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Multi-epitope gene transcription cassettes comprising four neutralizing epitope domains and four T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized and inserted into the genome of Newcastle disease virus strain La Sota between the P and M genes. Recombinant IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT was generated via reverse genetics, and its immune protection efficacy was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Our results show that rLa Sota/SBNT induced IBV-specific neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses and provided significant protection against homologous and heterologous IBV challenge. Thus, the T-cell epitope peptides identified in this study could be good candidates for IBV vaccine development, and recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing IBV multi-epitope genes represents a safe and effective vaccine candidate for controlling infectious bronchitis. IMPORTANCE T-cell-mediated immune responses are critical for the elimination of IBV-infected cells. To screen conserved T-cell epitopes in the IBV N protein, forty overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. By combining IFN- ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, and CFSE lymphocyte proliferation assays, we identified three CTL epitopes and one dual-specific T-cell epitope. The value of T-cell epitope peptides identified in the N protein was further verified by the design of an IBV multi-epitope vaccine. Results show that IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT provided cross protection against challenges with a QX-like or a TW-like IBV strain. So T-cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the control of viral infection and conserved T-cell epitopes serve as promising candidates for use in multi-epitope vaccine construction. Our results provide a new perspective for the development of a safer and more effective IBV vaccine.","output":"Identification of novel T-cell epitopes on infectious bronchitis virus N protein and development of a multi-epitope vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid Response Collecting has been a most apt methodology with which to document the COVID-19 pandemic for an increasing number of museums As the phenomenon unfolded across the globe, museums searched for and head-hunted the truth-revealing objects that could tell the stories and histories of the present to current and future generations Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic took Rapid Response Collecting to a higher level A methodology originally conceived for a sporadic phenomenon happening within a specific context during the early years of the 21st century gained much more traction almost overnight This paper shall make a case for a better understanding of the potential use and application of Rapid Response Collecting by art museums It shall look into the defining values of this collections development methodology and how these can be applied and adopted when acquiring works of art In doing so, it shall seek to understand to what extent the mainstream version of Rapid Response Collecting can be adapted for the needs, purposes and requirements of the art museum","output":"Collecting Pandemic Phenomena: Reflections on Rapid Response Collecting and the Art Museum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic put into question the organizational skills of LTCF. The containment measures implemented in several Asian countries avoided heavy death tolls in LTCF in contrast to other countries across the globe. The aim of this review is therefore to investigate and illustrate the measures that were undertaken in Asia to contain and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in LTCF. DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Asian older subjects institutionalized in LTCF. METHODS: Broad literature research from July 2020CApril 2021. The following search terms were used: COVID-19 Nursing homes AND the country of interest or contact tracing. Eligible categories for inclusion comprise editorials, reviews, government guidelines, letters to the editor, and perspectives. The COVID-19 measures were then subdivided into different sections and compiled into an evidence table. RESULTS: Prompt measures were put into action since the beginning of the pandemic that avoided the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. Examples range from simple acts of proper hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, swab testing, social distancing, preventive measures on health care workers, organizational measures such as quarantine, outbreak control, visitor restrictions, relationship with acute hospitals, and admission policy. Technology also played a fundamental role in promoting social distancing by using specific robots and in managing contact tracing. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The Asian preventive control guidelines are similar to those recommended elsewhere. Difference in timing and past experience with prior outbreaks such as SARS and MERS might have favored the Asian response. Furthermore, sociocultural values toward older persons by protecting and making sure that LTCF are part of the health care system could have also played a role.","output":"Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) During the COVID-19 PandemicLessons From the Asian Approach: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We prove Bloch's formula for the Chow group of 0-cycles with modulus on smooth projective varieties over finite fields.

The level of knowledge was expressed as the number of correct answers (0C11 for tattooing, 0C14 for piercing). A total of 2985 participants (mean age 23.15  3.99, 73.9% F) participated in the study. Although 95.4% of the respondents were aware of possible health consequences of body art, a low level of specific knowledge was registered for both tattooing (mean number of correct answers 5.38  2.39) and piercing (5.93  3.12) consequences. Lower knowledge was associated with the attendance of non-life science course and with lower duration of academic education for both tattoo and piercing. Lower knowledge of tattooing risks was related with commuter status, while lower knowledge of piercing risks was associated with lower fathers education.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the lives of people around the world, including Nepal. The child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) needs and services in Nepal have a significant gap. CAMH in Nepal suffers from lack of specialized training in this field as well as scarcity of human resources and services. There is only one full-time child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) out-patient clinic in the country. Some recent activities have focused on CAMH in Nepal but the COVID-19 pandemic has produced new challenges. Access to mental health services for children and adolescents (C&A) across Nepal has been adversely affected. Factors such as closure of schools, confinement at home, lockdown, transportation problems, uncertainty, loss of usual routine and fear of infection have affected the mental health of C&A. This has highlighted a need to build capacity of available local human resources, enhance community support, teach measures of coping with stress and improve CAMH service delivery by strengthening the referral system, but these have to be addressed overcoming problems of travel restrictions and limited resources. To address these needs, online platform can be a suitable approach. With this view, a multi-tier CAMH intervention model was developed, which utilizes online platform for training mental health professionals across Nepal, who would then facilitate sessions for C&A, teachers, parents and caregivers; and link them to CAMH services locally, and remotely through teleconsultation. This started as a pilot from June 2020 and will continue till end of February 2021, with the aim to reach 40,000 C&A, parents, teachers and caregivers. As of Nov 2020, this model has been used to successfully conduct 1,415 sessions, with 28,597 population reached. Among them, 16,571 are C&A and 12,026 are parents, teachers and caregivers, across all 7 provinces of Nepal. In this paper, the multi-tier intervention to address the COVID-19 related CAMH problems has been discussed as a feasible framework for resource limited settings and LMICs like Nepal.","output":"Identification and Management of COVID-19 Related Child and Adolescent Mental Health Problems: A Multi-Tier Intervention Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, food marketing for unhealthy foods is omnipresent. Foods high in fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) are advertised intensively on several media platforms, including digital platforms that are increasingly used by children, such as social media, and can be bought almost everywhere.

As the majority of children and adolescents do not eat the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables (F&V), which leads to chronic diseases, we need to change the obesogenic environment to a healthogenic environment. Reducing the marketing of energy-dense snacks to children and increasing the promotion of healthier foods, such as fruits and vegetables, may be an effective and necessary instrument to improve the dietary intake of children and reduce the risk of their experiencing some chronic diseases later in life. With this focused narrative review, we provide an overview of how children and adolescents react to food promotions and how food promotional efforts might be a useful tool to increase the attractiveness of fruit and vegetables.

Materials and Methods The study was conducted in a level three, 16-bed COVID intensive care unit. The investigation was planned as a retrospective and observational study. Patients who were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure in the intensive care unit between March 2020 and March 2021 and followed up due to critical illness were evaluated. Result A total of 213 patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Median age of the patients was 66 (IQR 56.5-74) years, and 134 (62.9%) were males. One hundred and sixty-six (77.9%) of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Patients were followed up mainly with invasive mechanical ventilation [104 (48.8%)] and high flow nasal cannula [67 (31.5%)]. Median number of days was 7 (IQR 4-10) and included the first symptom onset to intensive care admission. The time to intubation was 9 (IQR 4-15) days, and the median day to intensive care discharge was 16 (IQR 11-23). After the symptoms started, first tocilizumab 9 (IQR 5-11) and pulse steroid treatment 8 (IQR 3-11) were found to be close to each other. In total, 95 (44.6%) of the 213 patients died. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 associated viral disease can progress after simple symptoms to hospital admission in a median of four days and to intensive care admission requiring intubation in a median of nine days. We believe that a better understanding of the clinical course of COVID-19 and its change between centers can be revealed through sharing information from different countries and centers.","output":"Timeline of critically ill 2019 SARS-CoV-2 cases after onset of illness: Intensive care data from Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented preventive measures towards reducing infections. These conditions can affect the mental health of children and adolescents; however, this has not yet been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze changes in symptomatology and positive emotions in Argentine children and adolescents since the onset of isolation, based on parent/caregiver report. We analyzed differences based on gender, age, socioeconomic status (SS) and containment measure (and their interactions); their associations with symptomatology and positive affect of parents/caregivers; and the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on these associations. METHOD: A total of 1205 caregivers responded to a survey regarding the mental health of children and adolescents under their care. They also completed a set of anxiety, depression, and affect measures about themselves. RESULTS: A considerable proportion of parents/caregivers perceived changes in their childrens and adolescents mental health compared to before the pandemic. Increased levels of anxiety-depression, aggression-irritability, impulsivity-inattention, and dependence-withdrawal were reported, as well as alterations in sleeping and eating habits, and a reduction in positive affect. Differences were observed according to their age and containment measure. Finally, we found correlations between parents/caregivers symptomatology and that reported about their children or adolescents. Gender, age and SS moderated some of these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Continued monitoring of child and adolescent mental health is a fundamental necessity. We recommend the implementation of early intervention strategies to prevent the escalation of serious mental health problems, particularly in those groups that have been most adversely affected since the onset of the pandemic.","output":"Parental Perceptions of Child and Adolescent Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cressa cretica (Shuwwayl) is a halophytic that belongs to Convolvulaceae, naturally grown in the Middle East including Iraq.

Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism.

The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test were 91.67% and 100.00%, respectively. The RT-qPCR positivity rate of forensic cases was higher than the cumulative infection rate for the entire population. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected with the rapid antigen test and RT-qPCR within 216 hours of death. Because the rapid antigen test showed the same sensitivity and specificity as those observed in clinical practice, the test combined with RT-qPCR may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19 even in postmortem specimens.","output":"Comprehensive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection Using Polymerase Chain Reaction and Rapid Antigen Testing in Postmortem Specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This article describes the methodology used for the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference.

For New Zealand midwives, the sudden changes to how they work with women and families during pregnancy, birth and postnatally, especially in the community, required unprecedented innovation and adaptation. The volume of information coming from many different sources, and the speed with which it was changing and updating, added further stress to the delivery of a midwifery model of care underpinned by partnership, collaboration, informed choice, safety and relational continuity. Despite the uncertainties, midwives continued their care for women and their families across all settings.

This article provides background and discussion of these events and reports on a content analysis of media reporting the impact on the maternity system in New Zealand during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the New Zealand midwife was a major influencer and initiator for relational care to occur uninterrupted at the frontline throughout the COVID-19 lockdown, despite the personal risk. The initial 5-week lockdown in March 2020 involved stringent restrictions requiring all New Zealanders, other than essential workers such as midwives, to remain at home. Midwives kept women, their families and communities central to the conversation throughout lockdown whilst juggling their concerns about keeping themselves and their own families safe.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and specialized databases of economic evaluation from December 2019 to July 2020 to identify relevant literature to economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and did their quality assessment by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Then, quality synthesis of results was done. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies of economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The CHEERS scores for most studies (n = 9) were 85 or higher (excellent quality). Eight studies scored 70 to 85 (good quality), eight studies scored 55 to 70 (average quality), and one study < %55 (poor quality). The decision-analytic modeling was applied to twenty-three studies (88%) to evaluate their services. Most studies utilized the SIR model for outcomes. In studies with long-time horizons, social distancing was more cost-effective than quarantine, non-intervention, and herd immunity. Personal protective equipment was more cost-effective in the short-term than non-intervention. Screening tests were cost-effective in all studies. CONCLUSION: The results suggested screening tests and social distancing to be cost-effective alternatives in preventing and controlling COVID-19 on a long-time horizon. However, evidence is still insufficient and too heterogeneous to allow any definite conclusions regarding costs of interventions. Further research as are required in the future.","output":"Economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and its associated preventive measures such as national and regional lockdowns have dramatically changed the epidemiology of pediatric admissions to the emergency department. Nevertheless, there are scant data on the epidemiology and injury patterns of major pediatric trauma injuries during these lockdown periods.MethodsA single-center retrospective study of data obtained from a tertiary level 1 trauma hospital trauma registry. The data included demographics, injury mechanisms, injury severity and type, treatment, and resource utilization in children aged 0?18 years who required trauma team activation upon arrival. The analysis compares the data from the 5-week lockdown period from March to May 2020 in Jerusalem, Israel, to its parallel periods in 2018?2019.ResultsA total of 187 trauma visits that required trauma team activation (TTA) were analyzed: 48 visits during the lockdown period vs. 139 in 2018?2019, corresponding to a 40% drop in TTA. There was a significant decrease of 34% in MVA-related injuries (p = 0.0001) but a significant increase of 14% in burns (p = 0.01) and a 16% increase in bicycle-related injuries (p = 0.001). No changes in ISS, injury patterns, admission rate, PICU utilization, or need for interventions were observed.ConclusionThere was a significant decrease in the number of overall pediatric trauma visits during the 2020 lockdown, mainly in MVA-associated trauma, but an increase in burns and bicycle injuries. These findings can thus inform policy makers as to the need to formulate prevention awareness programs alerting the public to indoor hazards and the dangers of activities outside the home. Furthermore, it can inform hospital policy decision-making in future lockdowns. The fact that PICU admissions and the need for operating rooms stayed unchanged suggests that it is vital to maintain trauma team capabilities even during lockdowns.","output":"Changes in pediatric major trauma epidemiology, injury patterns, and outcome during COVID-19Cassociated lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A recent study identified a preprocedural P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 as a strong independent predictor of perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device. This study aimed to determine whether a last-recorded P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 predicts thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device in the same patient cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recorded patient and aneurysm characteristics, P2Y12 receptor antagonist administered, P2Y12 reaction units value with VerifyNow, procedural variables, and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device procedures at our institution during an 8-month period. Complications causing a permanent disabling neurologic deficit or death were considered major. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent 48 Pipeline Embolization Device procedures at our institution during the study period. There were 11 thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after treatment in our cohort (22.9%), 5 of which were major (10.4%). A last-recorded P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 was the only independent predictor of all (P = .002) and major (P = .03) thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications in our cohort. Most patients (71%) required, on average, 2 adjustments to the dose or type of P2Y12 receptor antagonist to remain within the 60-240 target P2Y12 reaction units range.

We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1439 municipalities out of 1507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20th to April 16th and from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 g/m3 in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 g/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO2 levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality. Our ecological study showed that exposure to PM was significantly associated with the COVID-19 incidence and excess mortality during the first wave of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.","output":"COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Lombardy, Italy: An ecological study on the role of air pollution, meteorological factors, demographic and socioeconomic variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three years after the November 2017 coup in Zimbabwe and the installation of Emmerson Mnangagwa as ruling party and state president, there is growing scholarly interest in identifying the character of the post-coup regime, particularly in comparison to the 37-year reign of Robert Mugabes ZANU-PF So far, there are continuities and changes, with increasing concerns about a qualitative shift in the militarization of Zimbabwean state and society under Mnangagwa and the further closing down of civil society space Perhaps more so than during the first two years of post-coup Zimbabwe, this has become abundantly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Asian & African Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd ) is the property of Sage Publications, Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Mnangagwas Zimbabwe: Crisis?

This study investigated the impact of these government policies on COVID-19 spread. METHODS: This ecological study included all 47 prefectures in Japan as samples between February 3 and December 27, 2020. We used COVID-19 cases and mobility as variables. Additionally, places where social contacts could accrue, defined as restaurants, companies, transportation, and tourist spots; mean temperature and humidity; the number of inhabitants in their twenties to fifties; and the number of COVID-19 cases in the previous period, which were factors or covariates in the graphical modeling analysis, were divided into five periods according to the timing of the implementation of the state of emergency and Go To campaign. RESULTS: Graphical changes occurred throughout all five periods of COVID-19. During the state of emergency (period 2), a correlation between COVID-19 cases and those before the state of emergency (period 1) was observed, although this correlation was not significant in the period after the state of emergency was lifted (period 3). During the implementation of Go To Travel and the Go To Eat campaigns (period 5), the number of places where social contacts could accrue was correlated with COVID-19 cases, with complex associations and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the state of emergency affected the control of COVID-19 spread and that the Go To campaign led to increased COVID-19 cases due to increased mobility by changing behavior in the social environment where social contacts potentially accrue.","output":"Changes in social environment due to the state of emergency and Go To campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, and cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in patients with prostate cancer.

Briefly presented is evidence that in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, a dysfunctional immune system due to SARS-COV-2 and injudicious use of corticosteroids may be largely responsible for this malady. OBJECTIVE: To find the possible impact of COVID 19 infection and various co-morbidities on occurrence of ROCM and demonstrate the outcome based on medical and surgical interventions. Methodology. Prospective longitudinal study included patients diagnosed with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis after a recent COVID-19 infection. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy (DNE) was performed on each patient and swabs were taken and sent for fungal KOH staining and microscopy. Medical management included Injection Liposomal Amphotericin B, Posaconazole and Voriconazole. Surgical treatment was restricted to patients with RT PCR negative results for COVID-19. Endoscopic, open, and combined approaches were utilized to eradicate infection. Follow-up for survived patients was maintained regularly for the first postoperative month. RESULTS: Out of total 131 patients, 111 patients had prior history of SARS COVID 19 infection, confirmed with a positive RT-PCR report and the rest 20 patients had no such history. Steroids were received as a part of treatment in 67 patients infected with COVID 19. Among 131 patients, 124 recovered, 1 worsened and 6 died. Out of 101 known diabetics, 98 recovered and 3 had fatal outcomes. 7 patients with previous history of COVID infection did not have any evidence of Diabetes mellitus, steroid intake or any other comorbidity.

Initially, it's soluble form (sDPP-4) was described as an adipokine mediating metabolic inflammation. This is recently questioned in mechanistic rodent studies. To further clarify sDPP-4's role in physiology and metabolic diseases, we examined sDPP-4 in a large human cohort and during weight-loss interventions. Like ACE2, sDPP-4 serves as a binding partner for certain corona-like viruses enabling virus entry. As metabolic diseases are major risk factors for the COVID-19 pandemic, we additionally examined sDPP-4 in patients suffering severe Sars-CoV-2 infection. Methods sDPP-4 serum concentrations were measured using ELISA and related to various metabolic variables. Using a case-control-design, sDPP-4 was assessed in acute COVID-19 and sepsis infection. Results sDPP-4 increased with body weight, insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia but reduced in type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension. Altered serum concentrations appeared with impaired liver and kidney but not cardiac function. No association to systemic inflammation was observed. Having found increased sDPP-4 in obesity, surgical (gastric bypass/sleeve gastrectomy) and non-surgical weight-loss interventions revealed a significant association of sDPP-4 with the improvement of liver function but neither with changes in body weight nor fat mass. Complementary, the case control study revealed reduced sDPP-4 concentrations specific for COVID-19 infection. Conclusions We suggest that sDPP-4 is rather related to hepatic abnormalities in obesity than primarily functioning as an adipokine. sDPP-4 is implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism, but not fundamentally in systemic inflammation.

The severe group included patients with severe pneumonia or critical events. Intensive care unit admission or death were the critical events in this study. We compared the clinical and CT findings between the severe and non-severe groups and investigated the prognostic factors and critical events of the severe group using the regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 281 patients, 36 (12.8%) patients were in the severe group and 245 (87.2%) patients were in the non-severe group. Critical events occurred in 10 patients (3.6%). In the severe group, patients showed significantly more pneumonia with consolidation, crazy-paving appearance, pleural effusion, and higher CT scores than those in the non-severe group (all, P < 0.05).

A value framework was constructed via document reviews and stakeholder consultations. Probability of Success (PoS) data was obtained for 16 platform projects through expert assessments and stakeholder portfolio preferences via a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The structure of preferences and the uncertainties in project PoS suggested a non-linear, stochastic value maximization problem. A simulation-optimization algorithm was employed, identifying optimal portfolios under different budget constraints. Stochastic dominance of the optimization solution was tested via mean-variance and mean-Gini statistics, and its robustness via rank probability analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. Project PoS estimates were low and substantially overlapping. The DCE identified decreasing rates of return to investing in single platform types. Optimal portfolio solutions reflected this non-linearity of platform preferences along an efficiency frontier and diverged from a model simply ranking projects by PoS-to-Cost, despite significant revisions to project PoS estimates during the review process in relation to the conduct of the DCE. Large confidence intervals associated with optimization solutions suggested significant uncertainty in portfolio valuations. Mean-variance and Mean-Gini tests suggested optimal portfolios with higher expected values were also accompanied by higher risks of not achieving those values despite stochastic dominance of the optimal portfolio solution under the decision maker's budget constraint. This portfolio was also the highest ranked portfolio in the simulation; though having only a 54% probability of being preferred to the second-ranked portfolio. The analysis illustrates how optimization modelling can help health R&D decision makers identify optimal portfolios in the face of significant decision uncertainty involving portfolio trade-offs. However, in light of such extreme uncertainty, further due diligence and ongoing updating of performance is needed on highly risky projects as well as data on decision makers' portfolio risk attitude before PDA can conclude about optimal and robust solutions.","output":"Prioritizing investments in rapid response vaccine technologies for emerging infections: A portfolio decision analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the freight demand network spatial patterns in six provinces of central China from the perspective of the spread of the epidemic and the freight imbalance and breakout.

Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 multi-spike trimers, an icosahedral DNA framework was assembled to spatially arrange up to thirty neutralizing aptamers (IDNA-30) with nanometer precision to inhibit viral infection. Each triangular plane of IDNA-30 is composed of three precisely positioned aptamers topologically matching SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, thus forming a multivalent spatially patterned binding. Additionally, due to its multiple binding sites and moderate size, multifaced IDNA induces aggregation of viruses. Moreover, the rigid icosahedron framework afforded by four-helixes not only forms a steric barrier to prevent the virus from binding to host, but also limits the conformational transformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Combining multivalent topologically patterned aptamers with structurally well-defined nano-formulations, IDNA-30 exhibits excellent neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 and a broad neutralizing activity against several mutant strains. Overall, this spatially matched neutralizing strategy provides a new direction for the assembly of neutralizing reagents to enhance the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and combat other disease-causing viruses.","output":"Spatially patterned neutralizing icosahedral DNA nanocage for efficient SARS-CoV-2 blocking (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many people with dementia reach the end-of-life without an advance care plan. Many are not ready to have conversations about end-of-life, and decision-making is left to their families and professionals when they no longer have capacity. Carers may benefit from further support with decision-making. To develop this support, it is important to understand the decision-making process. AIM: Explore with family carers and people living with dementia the decision-making process and factors that influence decision-making in dementia end of life care, to produce a model of decision-making in the context of dementia end-of-life care. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 21 family carers and 11 people with dementia in England (2018C2019) from memory clinics, general practice and carer organisations. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and findings were mapped onto the Interprofessional Shared Decision Making model, refined to produce a modified model of decision-making in dementia. RESULTS: Participants described five key decisions towards the end-of-life as examples of decision making. We used these experiences to produce a modified model of decision-making in dementia end-of-life-care. The model considers the contextual factors that influence the decision-making process, including: personal preferences; advance care planning and Lasting Power of Attorney; capacity and health and wellbeing of the person with dementia; support from others and clarity of roles. The decision-making process consists of seven inter-linked stages: 1) identifying the decision maker or team; 2) sharing and exchanging information; 3) clarifying values and preferences; 4) managing and considering emotions; 5) considering the feasibility of options; 6) balancing preferred choice and the actual choice; and 7) implementation and reflecting on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The modified model breaks down the decision-making process and attempts to simplify the process while capturing the subtle nuances of decision making. It provides a framework for conversations and supporting decisions by carers.","output":"Developing an applied model for making decisions towards the end of life about care for someone with dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The study aimed to investigate the long-term efficacy of conventional laser photocoagulation in the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Methods: In this retrospective study, the records of patients presented with diabetic macular edema (DME) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were reviewed. DME defined as clinically significant macular edema was treated by using argon green or yellow dye laser with focal, grid, and modified grid techniques according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study parameters. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured. BCVA change after the treatment and its relationship with other factors were evaluated. Results: The study included 133 eyes of 81 patients. The mean follow-up was 28.26 months. BCVA demonstrated the increase of 2 lines or more in 20.7% of the eyes, stabilization within 2 lines in 60.7% of the eyes, and loss of 2 lines or more in 18.3% of the eyes. The eyes with baseline BCVA lower than or equal to 0.50 showed a statistically significant increase (p=0.001) whereas the eyes with baseline BCVA of more than 0.50 did not show a statistically significant change (p=0.070) after laser photocoagulation treatment. Conclusions: Conventional laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment in diabetic macular edema including center-involved type and stabilizes visual acuity in the majority of the patients. Improvement in BCVA is significant in the group with lower baseline BCVA.

METHODS: Laboratory results and obstetrical outcomes of women with singleton gestations, admitted for delivery during the COVID-19 mask-wearing period (April-June 2020) were compared with those of women delivering during the parallel period in 2019 and with a larger cohort derived from nine pre-pandemic years (March 2011-April 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 1838 women delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study describes the transition of The Spots buprenorphine service to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and one year treatment retention. METHODS: Patients actively engaged in care at the time of transition to telemedicine and patients newly engaged in buprenorphine services through telemedicine were included in this descriptive analysis and assessed at one year for retention. RESULTS: From March 16, 2020 to March 15, 2021, The Spot provided voice-only buprenorphine treatment services to 150 patients, 70.7% (n=106) male and 80.0% (n=120) Black; 131 were patients who transitioned from in person services and 19 were newly engaged via telemedicine. 80.7% (n=121) of patients remained engaged in treatment at one year, 16.0% (n=24) were lost to follow-up, and 3.3% (n=5) were deceased.

CONCLUSION: The Spots transition of patients from a street medicine program to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has implications for future practice. Increased flexibility of service delivery, extended prescription length, and decreased UDT likely contributed to high retention rates and should inform the future structure of low-threshold buprenorphine programs.","output":"Utilizing telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic for a low-threshold, street-based buprenorphine program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hendra virus (HeV) continues to pose a serious public health concern as spillover events occur sporadically. Terminally ill horses can exhibit a range of clinical signs including frothy nasal discharge, ataxia or forebrain signs. Early signs, if detected, can include depression, inappetence, colic or mild respiratory signs. All unvaccinated ill horses in areas where flying foxes exist, may potentially be infected with HeV, posing a significant risk to the veterinary community. Equivac? HeV vaccine has been fully registered in Australia since 2015 (and under an Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority special permit since 2012) for immunization of horses against HeV and is the most effective and direct solution to prevent disease transmission to horses and protect humans. No HeV vaccinated horse has tested positive for HeV infection. There is no registered vaccine to prevent, or therapeutics to treat, HeV infection in humans. Previous equine HeV outbreaks tended to cluster in winter overlapping with the foaling season (August to December), when veterinarians and horse owners have frequent close contact with horses and their bodily fluids, increasing the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. The most southerly case was detected in 2019 in the Upper Hunter region in New South Wales, which is Australia's thoroughbred horse breeding capital. Future spillover events are predicted to move further south and inland in Queensland and New South Wales, aligning with the moving distribution of the main reservoir hosts.

Methods A 3-year period observational study (2012C2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. Results The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85.5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35.5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support.

MERS-CoV was found to produce severe respiratory illness with case-fatality rates near 50%, and may be transmitted person-to-person in instances of close physical contact, such as among family members and to health care workers. As mice, hamsters, ferrets, and cynomolgus macaques are either not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection or do not develop observable clinical disease, we sought to determine whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can be used as a model of MERS-CoV infection and disease. Animals challenged with MERS-CoV via multiple combined infection routes rapidly developed pneumonia, and we observed other clinical signs of illness, virus shedding, and virus replication in respiratory tissues. Using microarrays to compare transcripts associated with histopathologic lesions removed from the lungs of infected animals, we identified 173 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) associated with lung lesions on day 3 post-infection concurrent with peak clinical signs. Functional analysis indicated that these genes were predominantly associated with proinflammatory processes, recruitment and chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, and antiviral immunity. Using singular value decomposition coupled multidimensional scaling (SVD-MDS), we also identified changes in similar inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a rapid activation of innate immune and inflammatory processes in leukocytes after infection. These data were consistent with cytokine and chemokine profiles in the blood of animals. Due to the urgent need for an effective therapeutic means of treating MERS-CoV patients, we used this rhesus macaque model to evaluate post-exposure treatment with combination interferon (IFN)-a2b and ribavirin (RBV), and identified key transcriptional signatures associated with disease severity and treatment efficacy. Animals treated with IFN-a2b/RBV beginning 8h post-infection did not develop significant clinical or severe histopathologic signs of disease, breathing abnormalities, or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and showed reduced viral loads and lower levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines. Microarray analysis of treated animals showed significant induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and fewer upregulated transcripts associated with inflammatory processes. Additionally, we identified a subset of statistically significant DEGs associated with signaling pathways such as hedgehog, which has been linked to airway function and protection against pulmonary injury. Together, these data indicate that treatment of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with IFN-a2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication and improves clinical outcome, and suggests a transcriptomic basis for therapeutic efficacy. As these two drugs are already used together in the clinic, IFN-a2b and ribavirin may be useful for therapeutic intervention and patient management of new human MERS-CoV cases.","output":"206 Transcriptional signatures of pathogenesis and successful type I interferon and ribavirin therapy in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of legal sociology is a study that has legal phenomena, but uses social science and sociology theory The role of Legal sociology is so tight when juxtaposed with a problem that is emerging, namely the global pandemic Coronavirus Disease (Covid)-19 The juridical normative research with a method of approach to the law, conceptual and comparative Legal materials that have been collected are analyzed by content analysis Some affected countries that successfully handled the COVID-19 pandemic, including: South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore Italy and United States containment strategy for handling Covid-19 are contradictory from those countries above PSBB has been applied in Indonesia and other countries The PSBB must be accompanied by other programs so that the government can successfully handle COVID-19 PSBB does not guarantee that the community will obey the regulation The most effective action with all the consequences is regional quarantine or lockdown accompanied by other supporting programs from the government ? 2021, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"The role of legal sociology in terms of covid-19: Large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in April 2020, we gathered partial county-level data on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, using both volunteer and paid crowdsourcing.

Hyperoxia enhances endurance performance by increasing O2 availability to locomotor muscles. We investigated whether hyperoxia can also improve prolonged self-paced exercise under conditions of elevated thermal and cardiovascular strain. What is the main finding and its importance? Hyperoxia improved self-paced exercise performance in hot and cool conditions. However, the extent of the improvement (increased work rate relative to normoxia) was greater in cool conditions. This suggests that the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain during prolonged self-paced exercise under heat stress may attenuate the hyperoxia-mediated increase in O2 delivery to locomotor muscles. ABSTRACT This study sought to determine whether breathing hyperoxic gas when self-paced exercise performance is impaired under heat stress enhances power output. Nine well-trained male cyclists performed four 40 min cycling time trials: two in 18 C (COOL) and two in 35 C (HOT). For the first 30 min participants breathed ambient air and for the remaining 10 min normoxic (FiO2 : 0.21, NOR) or hyperoxic (FiO2 : 0.45, HYPER) air. During the first 30 min of the time trials power output was lower in the HOT (250 W) compared with COOL (273 W) conditions (P < 0.05). In the final 10 min, power output was higher in HOT-HYPER (264  25 W) than HOT-NOR (244  31 W; P = 0.008), and COOL-HYPER (315  28 W) than COOL-NOR (284  25 W; P < 0.001). The increase in absolute power output in COOL-HYPER was greater than in HOT-HYPER (12 W; P = 0.057), as was normalized power output (30%; P < 0.001). SpO2 increased in HOT-HYPER and COOL-HYPER (P < 0.05), with COOL-HYPER being higher than HOT-HYPER (P < 0.01). Heart rate was higher during the HOT compared with COOL trials (P < 0.01), as were mean skin temperature (P < 0.001) and peak rectal temperature (HOT: 39.5 C and COOL: 38.9 C; P < 0.01). Thermal discomfort was also higher in the HOT compared with COOL (P < 0.01), whereas ratings of perceived exertion were similar (P > 0.05). Hyperoxia enhanced performance during the final 25% of a 40 min time trial in both HOT and COOL conditions compared with normoxia. However, the attenuated increase in absolute and normalized power output noted in the HOT condition suggests that heat stress may mitigate the influence of hyperoxia.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The characteristics of each patient at the time of ICU triage were used to determine how patients would have been prioritized using four crisis standards of care protocols. The vast majority of patients in the cohort would have been in the highest priority group using a triage protocol focusing on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment alone. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 1-year life expectancy would have resulted in only slightly more differentiation between patients. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 5-year life expectancy would have added significant additional differentiation depending on how priority groups were defined. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable controversy regarding the use of criteria other than prognosis for short-term survival in initial allocation of critical care resources under crisis standards of care triage protocols. To the extent that initial triage protocols would not create sufficient differentiation between patients, effectively resulting in a first-come, first-served initial allocation of resources, it is important to focus on how resources would be reallocated in the event of ongoing scarcity.","output":"Existing Crisis Standards of Care Triage Protocols May Not Significantly Differentiate Between Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Require Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The response of the scientific community to the global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented number of manuscripts in a short period of time, the vast majority of which have been shared in the form of preprints posted on online preprint repositories before peer review This surge in preprint publications has in itself attracted considerable attention, although mostly in the bibliometrics literature In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power law in the low rank (high frequency) region, with the high rank (low frequency) tail being better described by a q-exponential function The Zipf-like law in the high frequency regime indicates the presence of a cumulative advantage effect, whereby servers that already have more preprints receive more submissions ?

An infection control surveillance-working group (ICS-WG) and infection control coordinators (ICCs) team were created to monitor the IPC practices of the healthcare workers (HCWs) in a regional hospital in Korea. This study analyzed the surveillance results and aimed to identify what IPC practices needed improvement. METHODS: During phase 1 (March to April 2020), the ICS-WG performed random audits, recorded incidences of improper IPC practices, and provided advice to the violators. During phase 2 (April to July), the ICCs inspected the hospital units and proposed practical ideas about IPC. The surveillance and proposals targeted the following practices: patient screening, usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand and respiratory hygiene, equipment reprocessing, environmental cleaning, management of medical waste, and social distancing. RESULTS: In phase 1, of the 127 violations observed, most (32.3%) corresponded to hand and respiratory hygiene. In phase 2, the highest proportion of violation per category was observed in the management of medical waste (37.8%); among these, a higher proportion of violation (71.4%) was observed in the collection of medical waste. Of the 106 proposals made by the ICCs, the most addressed practice was patient screening (28.3%). No case of nosocomial infection was reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: Adherence to proper hand and respiratory hygiene was inadequate at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that more attention and further training are needed for the management of medical waste, particularly medical waste collection, and that continuous upgrading of the strategies for patient screening is essential.

Evaluation: The virtual experiential training was conducted over two weeks and was imparted employing different virtual platforms like Google Classroom, Google Meet, Google Forms, Google Docs, etc. As a part of the community pharmacy training, the students were given different e-activities and tasks like e-case scenario analysis and interpretation, e-prescription screening, virtual patient education and were shown various 3-D animated videos related to community pharmacy. For the hospital training, the students were given different e-cases for developing pharmaceutical care plans, e-case scenario analysis, e-drug information query and were shown different animated videos related to rounds of different hospital departments. Conclusion: The virtual experiential training was successfully conducted achieving the desired learning outcomes and was well received by the students. Based on this experience, it is recommended that efforts should be made to develop an integrated model for experiential training in the future, which can be an amalgamation of online tools and traditional experiential methods.","output":"Experiential training during COVID-19 pandemic: a virtual attachment experience from a college of pharmaceutical sciences in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last 2 decades, several coronaviruses (CoVs) have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing highly prevalent and severe respiratory diseases, often with fatal outcomes. CoVs are a large group of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which encode large replicase polyproteins that are processed by viral peptidases to generate the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) that mediate viral RNA synthesis. Papain-like peptidases (PLPs) and chymotrypsin-like cysteine 3C-like peptidase are essential for coronaviral replication and represent attractive antiviral drug targets. Furthermore, CoVs utilize the activation of their envelope spike glycoproteins by host cell peptidases to gain entry into cells. CoVs have evolved multiple strategies for spike protein activation, including the utilization of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. In this review, viral and host peptidases involved in CoV cell entry and replication are discussed in depth, with an emphasis on papain-like cysteine cathepsins. Furthermore, important findings on cysteine peptidase inhibitors with regard to virus attenuation are highlighted as well as the potential of such inhibitors for future treatment strategies for CoV-related diseases.","output":"The role of cysteine peptidases in coronavirus cell entry and replication: The therapeutic potential of cathepsin inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19).

Despite CoViD-19 vaccines are already being administered, alternative treatments that address the immunopathology of the infection are still needed. For this end, a deeper knowledge on how our immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 is required. In this study, we propose a non-integer order model to understand the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We calculated the basic reproduction number and analysed the values of the model parameters in order to understand which ones inhibit or enhance the progression of the infection.

Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed. CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-controlled studies and trials to better understand effective ingredients and to identify those interventions warranting wider implementation.","output":"Effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults experiencing financial uncertainty: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 is reflected by significant changes in multiple urine peptides. Based on this observation, a clinical test based on urinary peptides predicting COVID-19 severity, CoV50, was developed and registered as IVD in Germany. We have hypothesized that molecular changes displayed by CoV50, to a large degree likely reflective of endothelial damage, can be significantly reversed by specific drugs. To test this hypothesis, we have collected urinary peptide data from patients without COVID-19 prior and after drug treatment. The drugs chosen were selected based on availability of sufficient number of participants in the dataset (n>20) and potential value of drug therapies in the treatment of COVID-19 based on reports in the literature. In these participants without COVID-19, while spironolactone did not demonstrate a significant impact on CoV50 scoring, empagliflozin treatment resulted in a significant change in CoV50 scoring, indicative of a potential therapeutic benefit. The results serve as a proof-of-principle for a drug repurposing approach based on human urinary peptide signatures and support the initiation of a randomised control trial testing a potential positive effect of empagliflozin in the treatment of severe COVID-19, possibly via endothelial protective mechanisms. Significance of the studyCOVID-19 pandemic has imposed a heavy burden on society, health care and economics. Although multiple drugs have been tested in the context of COVID-19, effective treatments for patients experiencing severe disease are still missing, with some drugs demonstrating benefit only at earlier disease stage. Computational drug repurposing emerged as a promising approach to boost drug development, allowing to predict drug efficacy based on the molecular signature of drug impact, mainly using transcriptomics data from cell lines. Recently we demonstrated that urinary proteomics profiles significantly differ between patients with severe COVID-19 course and those with mild/ moderate disease. This resulted in the development of a molecular signature associated with COVID-19 severity (CoV50), allowing to predict COVID-19 course, and enabling guiding intervention. Here we report on the first study demonstrating the application of clinical proteomics data (from clinical trial participants) in a drug repurposing approach. We used the CoV50 signature to examine if the molecular changes associated with COVID-19 severity in patients without COVID-19 might be altered by existing drugs. In a study population without COVID-19, empagliflozin demonstrated a partial, yet significant reversion of the CoV50 signature, indicating a potential benefit in the context of severe COVID-19.","output":"SGLT2-Inhibition reverts urinary peptide changes associated with severe COVID-19: an in-silico proof-of-principle of proteomics-based drug repurposing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This retrospective study was aimed to investigate the association between preoperative left ventricular (LV) cardiac function and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary edema (PE) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Most patients undergoing CEA for carotid artery stenosis have concomitant heart diseases, leading to hemodynamic instability that can cause postoperative cardiac complications such as cardiac heart failure. LV diastolic function has recently been recognized as an independent predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We analyzed clinical data from the anesthetic and medical records of 149 consecutive patients who underwent CEA at our university hospital between March 2012 and March 2018. LV systolic and diastolic function were evaluated by ejection fraction and the ratio of LV early diastolic filling velocity to the peak velocity of mitral medial annulus (E/e'). Postoperative PE was diagnosed based on chest X-ray and arterial gas analysis by two independent physicians. Postoperative PE was developed in four patients (2.8%). Patients with postoperative PE were not related to preoperative low ventricular ejection fraction, but had a significantly higher E/e' ratio than those without PE (P = 0.01). Furthermore, there was an increasing trend of PE according to the E/e' category. Preoperative LV diastolic function evaluated by E/e' was associated with the development of postoperative PE in patients who underwent CEA. The results suggest that the evaluation of LV diastolic dysfunction could be possibly useful to predict PE in patients undergoing CEA.","output":"Preoperative Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction Is Associated with Pulmonary Edema after Carotid Endarterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 infection and mortality rates are soaring in Western countries, Southeast Asian countries have successfully avoided the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic despite high population density. We provide a biochemical hypothesis for the connection between low COVID-19 incidence, mortality rates, and high visceral adiposity in Southeast Asian populations. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a gateway into the human body. Although the highest expression levels of ACE2 are found in people's visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asia, this does not necessarily make them vulnerable to COVID-19. Hypothetically, high levels of visceral adiposity cause systemic inflammation, thus decreasing the ACE2 amount on the surface of both visceral adipocytes and alveolar epithelial type 2 cells in the lungs. Extra weight gained during the pandemic is expected to increase visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asians, further decreasing the ACE2 pool. In contrast, weight gain can increase local inflammation in fat depots in Western people, leading to worse COVID-related outcomes. Because of the biological mechanisms associated with fat accumulation, inflammation, and their differential expression in Southeast Asian and Western populations, the second wave of the pandemic may be more severe in Western countries, while Southeast Asians may benefit from their higher visceral fat depots.","output":"The Obesity Paradox Predicts the Second Wave of COVID-19 to Be Severe in Western Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools are an attractive setting for implementation of mindfulness-based programs because mindfulness practices, by their very nature, align with a wide range of core educational goals.

We looked at patient characteristics, 30-day morbidity, and mortality. Outcomes were also assessed in donors and recipients who underwent surgery after recovery from COVID-19. RESULTS: The average number of transplants reduced from 11.5/month to 4.8/month. Fewer patients with MELD > 20 underwent LDLT in the COVID cohort (41.3% versus 24.5%, P = 0.03). Out of nine patients with a positive pretransplant COVID-19 PCR, there were 2 (22.3%) deaths on the waiting list. Seven patients underwent LT after recovery from COVID-19 with one 30-day mortality due to biliary sepsis. Three donors with positive COVID-19 PCR underwent uneventful donation after testing negative for COVID-19. No significant difference in 30-day survival was observed in the pre-COVID and COVID cohorts (93.2% versus 90.6%) (P = 0.3). Out of two recipients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia within 30 days after LT, there was one mortality. The 1-year survival for the entire cohort with a MELD cutoff of 20 was 90% and 84% (P = 0.2).

Viruses are classically considered to exert their pathologic actions through acute or chronic infection followed by the host response.

However, viruses may employ an alternative pathway to soluble cytokine-induced pathologies-by initiating the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. The best-understood example of this alternative pathway is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-elicited EVs and their propensity to harm vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, an HIV-encoded accessory protein called the \\"negative factor\\" (Nef) was demonstrated in EVs from the body fluids of HIV patients on successful combined antiretroviral therapy (ART); it was also demonstrated to be sufficient in inducing endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction.

METHODS: A combined evolutionary and molecular functional analysis of all sets of publicly available genomic data of viruses was performed. RESULTS: A leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) usually comprises the first 60-70 nts of the 5' UTR in a CoV genome, and the body transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-Bs) are located immediately upstream of the genes other than ORF1a and 1b. In each CoV genome, the TRS-L and TRS-Bs share a specific consensus sequence, namely the TRS motif. Any changes of nucleotide residues in the TRS motifs are defined as TRS motif mutations. Mutations in the TRS-L or multiple TRS-Bs result in superattenuated variants. The spread of super-attenuated variants may cause an increase in asymptomatic or mild infections, prolonged incubation periods and a decreased detection rate of the viruses, thus posing new challenges to SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control. The super-attenuated variants also increase their possibility of long-term coexistence with humans. The Delta variant is significantly different from all the previous variants and may lead to a large-scale transmission. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) with TRS motif mutation has already appeared and shown signs of spreading in Singapore, which, and even the Southeast Asia, may become the new epicenter of the next wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

We evaluated clinical outcomes in patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 with a disability compared with patients without a disability. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and discharged between Jan. 1, 2020, and Nov. 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Ontario, Canada. We compared in-hospital death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital length of stay and unplanned 30-day readmission among patients with and without a physical disability, hearing or vision impairment, traumatic brain injury, or intellectual or developmental disability, overall and stratified by age ( 64 and  65 yr) using multivariable regression, controlling for sex, residence in a long-term care facility and comorbidity. RESULTS: Among 1279 admissions to hospital for COVID-19, 22.3% had a disability. We found that patients with a disability were more likely to die than those without a disability (28.1% v. 17.6%), had longer hospital stays (median 13.9 v. 7.8 d) and more readmissions (17.6% v. 7.9%), but had lower ICU admission rates (22.5% v. 28.3%). After adjustment, there were no statistically significant differences between those with and without disabilities for in-hospital death or admission to ICU. After adjustment, patients with a disability had longer hospital stays (rate ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19C1.56) and greater risk of readmission (relative risk 1.77, 95% CI 1.14C2.75). In age-stratified analyses, we observed longer hospital stays among patients with a disability than in those without, in both younger and older subgroups; readmission risk was driven by younger patients with a disability.

METHODS: This multi-center, retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to four hospitals in Hubei Province, China, from 31 December, 2019 to 31 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their exposure to RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy within 48 hours of admission. Mixed-effect Cox model and Logistic regression were used to explore the association between early treatments of RBV/IFN-&#945; with primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2037 patients eventually included, 1281 patients received RBV/IFN-&#945; (RBV alone/IFN-&#945; alone/RBV combined with IFN-&#945;) treatments and 756 patients received none of these treatments. In mixed effect model, RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy was not associated with progression from non-severe into severe type (aHR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.88-1.36) or with reduction in 30-day mortality (aHR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.61-1.30).

Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (SeptemberCOctober 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between schools and the resurgence of the virus. METHODS: Using a Bayesian piecewise linear regression to scrutinise the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections in each region, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before and after the changepoint. RESULTS: In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%), an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (95% CI 14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50 days (95% CI 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72 days (95% CI 7.00 to 8.48) after it. CONCLUSION: Studying the rate of growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the regions provides some evidence in favour of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of the virus. The number of factors that could have played a role is too many to give a definitive answer. Still, the temporal correspondence warrants further systematic experiments to investigate on potential confounders that could clarify how much reopening schools mattered.","output":"Reopening Italys schools in September 2020: a Bayesian estimation of the change in the growth rate of new SARS-CoV-2 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candida auris has emerged as a fungal pathogen that causes nosocomial outbreaks worldwide. Diseases caused by this fungus are of concern, due to its reduced susceptibility to several antifungals. C. auris exhibits paradoxical growth (PG; defined as growth at high, but not intermediate antifungal concentrations) in the presence of caspofungin (CPF). We have characterized the cellular changes associated with adaptation to CPF. Using EUCAST AFST protocols, all C. auris isolates tested showed PG to CPF, although in some isolates it was more prominent. Most isolates also showed a trailing effect (TE) to micafungin and anidulafungin. We identified two FKS genes in C. auris that encode the echinocandins target, namely ?-1,3-glucan synthase. FKS1 contained the consensus hot-spot (HS) 1 and HS2 sequences. FKS2 only contained the HS1 region which had a change (F635Y), that has been shown to confer resistance to echinocandins in C. glabrata. PG has been characterized in other species, mainly C. albicans, where high CPF concentrations induced an increase in chitin, cell volume and aggregation. In C. auris CPF only induced a slight accumulation of chitin, and none of the other phenomena.

The paper analyses evidence since 2006 to understand the factors behind the trend for bigger ships (fleets between 18,000 and 24,000 TEU) and introduce a validated methodology for the prediction of the size of container ships. Experts presented a consensus vision in which factors associated with infrastructure, economics, technology, and the environment play a crucial role in driving the trend.

Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at N) and Hid41 (protonated at N), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric Mpro in vivo.

Innumerable policy areas, implicating both federal and provincial/territorial actors, are engaged in a pandemic response. Despite a formally dualist constitutional structure, grey zones C where jurisdictions overlap C exist. Effective public health responses require actors to sort out who does what and coordinate their actions. This paper examines federal dynamics in the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic, encompassing the initial outbreak in March 2020 and first wave, the summer months partial lull and the start of the second wave in the fall of 2020. Focusing primarily on health and public safety (including emergency power), it describes the constitutional and legislative frameworks shaping each order of governments actions, as well as the existing institutional intergovernmental frameworks. The article surveys the response measures taken at the federal and provincial levels and analyzes intergovernmental relations during this initial period. It also examines what measures were not taken C notably the invocation of the federal emergency power. The federal narrative of Canadas initial pandemic response is one of parallel action by various orders of government, in line with the dualist nature of the federation. Both the provinces and the center remain strong actors. Surprisingly, there have hardly been any jurisdictional turf battles. Still, initial convergences in public health measures have given way to greater variations as provinces re-opened in the summer of 2020. With infection rates and deaths differing radically across the country, relations between provinces have been strengthened and, in some cases, tested. Unlike some federations, which saw either centralisation (temporary or not) or the creation of new multilateral bodies often under federal leadership, intergovernmental relations have been real, particularly at the operational level, but muted. Consultations occurred via a number of both already established and more ad hoc intergovernmental channels, often with quiet and largely behind-the-scenes cooperation. New regional blocks have also emerged, to improve public health measures but also to maximize bargaining power and political pressure on the federal government. Generally, intergovernmental relations remain widespread, executive-led, and relatively effective. But opaque as ever.

Dinnombrables sphres de politiques publiques sont mobilises dans la lutte contre la pandmie. Elles relvent tant des autorits fdrales que des provinces et territoires. Malgr une structure constitutionnelle formellement dualiste, des zones grises, o les comptences se chevauchent, existent. Des rponses efficaces en termes de sant publique exigent que les acteurs clarifient ? qui fait quoi ? et coordonnent leurs actions. Ce texte examine les dynamiques fdrales des six premiers mois de la pandmie de Covid-19, couvrant le dclenchement de lpidmie en mars 2020 et la premire vague, laccalmie partielle des mois dt et le dbut de la deuxime vague  lautomne 2020. Sintressant principalement aux domaines de la sant et de la scurit publique (y compris les mesures durgence), il dcrit les cadres constitutionnel et lgislatif structurant les actions de chacun des ordres de gouvernement ainsi que les arrangements intergouvernementaux mis en place avant et pendant la pandmie. Larticle survole les mesures adoptes aux niveaux provincial et fdral et analyse la teneur des relations intergouvernementales dans cette priode initiale. Il examine aussi quelles mesures nont pas t prises C notablement linvocation des mesures durgence par lordre fdral. Le rcit qui merge met en exergue les actions parallles prises par divers ordres de gouvernement, conformment  la nature dualiste de la fdration. Tant les provinces que le centre demeurent des acteurs forts. Fait surprenant, la priode na t marque par aucun conflit de comptences significatif. Cela tant, la convergence initiale entre les mesures de sant publique a cd le pas  de plus grandes variations lors du ? dcloisonnement ? des provinces  lt 2020. Avec des taux dinfection et de mortalit variant radicalement  travers le pays, les relations entre provinces ont t  la fois renforces et, dans certains cas, mises  lpreuve. Contrairement  dautres fdrations, qui ont vcu une centralisation (temporaire ou non) ou la cration de nouveaux organes multilatraux souvent sous la direction du fdral, les relations intergouvernementales se sont manifestes, particulirement au niveau oprationnel, mais de manire discrte. Des consultations ont eu lieu via des canaux prexistants ou plus ad hoc. Des formes de coopration ont merg mais souvent de manire fort peu transparente. De nouveaux blocs rgionaux sont apparus, pour amliorer les mesures de sant publique, mais aussi pour maximiser le pouvoir de ngociation et la pression politique sur le gouvernement fdral. De manire gnrale, les relations intergouvernementales sont rpandues, domines par les pouvoirs excutifs et relativement efficaces. Mais toujours aussi opaques.","output":"Facing the Coronavirus Pandemic in the Canadian Federation: Reinforced Dualism and Muted Cooperation?

Respiratory involvement, the main symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, means that other manifestations, such as neurological, take a back seat, with the consequent delay in diagnosis and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological symptoms or diagnosed with encephalitis since March 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Zaragoza, Spain. RESULTS: Two patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal PCR and whose clinical picture consisted of neurological alterations compatible with encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiology was negative for bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 but, given the clinical suspicion of encephalitis due to the latter, antiviral treatment with immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis was started early. Despite this, the evolution was not satisfactory.

Our general paediatrics department has inpatient numbers which fluctuate on average from 50-100 or more. Patients are not allocated a particular ward but according to availability, so there is a large geographical spread across many wards. The team comprises of approximately 30 people consisting of FY1- ST8 doctors, ANPs and consultants. Each day different members of the team may be allocated to different wards depending on rotas. The consultant for each week however is consistent. There are minimal changes to the structure of the day however there are daily changes to patient complexities, continuity of staff and patient location within the hospital. Over a period of four years boards have been introduced to facilitate briefing/debriefing at the beginning and end of the working day. These were designed initially from feedback from the team;they have consequently been adapted and redesigned following PDSA cycles. Briefing and debriefing had been a well-established part of the team before the global pandemic in March 2020 which universally changed the way the team approached the working day, for example working in smaller sub teams to facilitate social distancing. Due to the substantial amount of change within the team we recognised that the daily briefing and debriefing was not functioning effectively. As a project group we developed and reintroduced new ways of briefing/debriefing that incorporated the government advice surrounding social distancing Objectives To re-introduce daily briefing/debriefing virtually having previously been embedded within the department in a face to face format pre Covid-19, to improve situational awareness including staff experience and patient safety using the five levels of care. Methods SCOPE-Recognition of a lack of brief/debrief because of unforeseen changes in the 'normal' working day due to covid-19 SHAPE- a questionnaire was designed to obtain feedback from the stakeholders to evaluate their input regarding the briefing/debriefing (pre covid-19). Using feedback collated, our focus was to improve situational awareness and learning opportunities for brief and develop the opportunity for the team to debrief. SHIFT- Developing new tools using virtual systems to enable brief/debrief to occur in a timely and safe way. Education and training was provided for members of the team. Engagement from the whole team was essential for briefing and debriefing to be sustainable. within the routine of the working day. However, ongoing PDSA and feedback from the ever changing team updates and changes are occurring Results We measured qualitative data for 2 months after the introduction of virtual briefing/debriefing. Some examples were 'helps with team morale' and 'worthwhile but would be better if we could do it as a whole team'. Conclusions The process of virtual briefing/debriefing has been well received by the team with improved situational awareness, learning and education while creating an open space for debrief and reflection. As patient demographics and numbers change, we continue to make adaptations to our process with repeated feedback. Team engagement when implementing change has been key to its success.","output":"The introduction of virtual briefing and debriefing in a global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of disability among neurological disorders.

The purpose of our study was to explore risk factors and develop a prognostic nomogram for lower extremity DVT in neurointensive care unit patients. METHODS: We prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical data of 420 neurointensive care unit patients who received treatment in our institution between January 2018 and September 2019. Stepwise logistic regression was used to select predictors. R software was used to develop the prognostic nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was validated using a validation cohort of patients with data collected between October 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: Among 420 patients, 153 (36.4%) had lower extremity DVT and five (1.2%) had both DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) in our study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age [odds ratio (OR): 1.050; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.029C1.071; P < 0.001], Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (OR: 0.889; 95% CI: 0.825C0.959; P = 0.002), D-dimer level (OR: 1.040; 95% CI: 1.008C1.074; P = 0.014), muscle strength (OR: 2.424; 95% CI: 1.346C4.366; P = 0.003), and infection (OR: 1.778; 95% CI: 1.034C3.055; P = 0.037) were independent predictors for lower extremity DVT. These predictors were selected to be included in the nomogram model. The area under the curve values in the primary cohort and validation cohort were 0.817 (95% CI: 0.776C0.858) and 0.778 (95% CI: 0.688C0.868), respectively, and respective Brier scores were 0.167 and 0.183. CONCLUSION: Age, GCS score, D-dimer level, muscle strength, and infection are independent predictors for lower extremity DVT.

The aim of the current study was to formulate an excellent model specially for predicting prognosis in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2015, 749 early-stage BC patients who received NAC in Xijing hospital were included. Patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 563) and an independent cohort (n = 186). A prognostic model was created and subsequently validated. Predictive performance and discrimination were further measured and compared with other models. RESULTS: Clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, grade, estrogen receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and treatment, Ki-67 expression, lymphovascular invasion, and residual cancer burden were identified as independent prognostic variables for BC treated with NAC. The C-index of the model consistently outperformed other available models as well as single independent factors with 0.78, 0.80, 0.75, 0.82, and 0.77 in the training cohort, independent cohort, luminal BC, HER2-positive BC, and triple-negative BC, respectively. With the optimal cut-off values (280 and 360) selected by X-tile, patients were categorized as low-risk (total points 280), moderate-risk (280 < total points  360), and high-risk (total points >360) groups presenting significantly different 5-year DFS of 89.9%, 56.9%, and 27.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BC, the first model including residual cancer burden index was demonstrated to predict the survival of individuals with favorable performance and discrimination. Furthermore, the risk stratification generated by it could determine the risk level of recurrence in whole early-stage BC cohort and subtype-specific cohorts, help tailor personalized intensive treatment, and select comparable study cohort in clinical trials.","output":"Development, verification, and comparison of a risk stratification model integrating residual cancer burden to predict individual prognosis in early-stage breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for a malaria vaccine is indisputable. A single vaccine for Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages targeting the major sporozoite antigen circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has had partial success.

It emerged in late 2019 and researchers worldwide race time to identify druggable targets where medicinal chemists can design potential inhibitors. Objective: Drug repurposing is one of the most convenient methods available now to find already approved drugs for human use with a potential tendency to cure COVID-19. Method: Within this work, the FDA-approved drug database containing 1281 drugs was employed to extract possible drugs that could have activity against the main protease enzyme in this virus. Various computer-aided drug design techniques, such as pharmacophore generation, ligand pharmacophore mapping, molecular docking and filtering techniques, were used to identify potential inhibitors. The cocrystallized ligand inside the main protease enzyme was utilized to generate two structure-based pharmacophores that were used as templates for deletion in the FDA database. To validate the selection of the active hits from pharmacophore mapping, molecular docking via LibDock was performed, while the highest scoring candidate was selected. Results: Interestingly, three antiviral drugs (lopinavir, saquinavir and remdesivir) were qualified to be potential main protease inhibitors.

The purpose of this study was to describe the decision-making process providers use when managing infectious conjunctivitis, to identify factors that reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced prescribing behavior. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 providers caring for children in primary care, urgent cares, and emergency departments in Denver, Colorado. Interviews were evaluated for major themes using deductive and inductive content analysis methods. RESULTS: Significant drivers for deciding to treat infectious conjunctivitis with antibiotics included patient's clinical presentation, family expectations, antibiotic stewardship concerns, etiological diagnostic uncertainty, and school/daycare policies. High variability existed in approaches used to distinguish viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. No providers were aware of pediatric treatment guidelines or standardized recommendations for return to school or daycare. Providers reported higher antibiotic prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors identified that could reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing included family education, a reliable diagnostic test to decrease diagnostic uncertainty, pediatric clinical guidelines, and standardizing exclusion policies for school/daycare. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pediatric infectious conjunctivitis is inconsistent. Creation of guidelines for the evaluation and management of infectious conjunctivitis in children could help reduce unnecessary prescribing and the burden for families and the health care system.

The reason for such inefficiency remains unclear. The present study used a surgical strategy to seal the whole pig liver in vivo. METHODS A solution of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) DNA was injected under two different venous injection conditions (anterograde and retrograde), employing flow rates of 10 and 20 ml/s in each case, with the aim of identifying the best gene transfer conditions. The gene delivery and information decoding steps were evaluated by measuring the eGFP DNA, mRNA and protein copy number 24 h after transfection. In addition, gold nanoparticles (diameters of 4 and 15 nm) were retrogradely injected (10 ml/s) to observe, by electron microscopy, the ability of the particle to access the hepatocyte. RESULTS The gene delivery level was higher with anterograde injection, whereas the efficacy of gene expression was better with retrograde injection, suggesting differences in the decoding processes. Thus, retrograde injection mediates gene transcription (mRNA copy/cell) equivalent to that of intermediate expression proteins but the mRNA translation was lower than that of rare proteins. Electron microscopy showed that nanoparticles within the hepatocyte were almost exclusively 4 nm in diameter. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the low activity of mRNA translation limits the final efficacy of the gene transfer procedure. On the other hand, the gold nanoparticles study suggests that elongated DNA conformation could offer advantages in that the access of 15-nm particles is very limited.","output":"Low RNA translation activit limits the efficacy of hydrodynamic gene transfer to pig liver in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zinc, an essential micronutrient in the human body, is a component in over 300 enzymes and participates in regulating enzymatic activity.

Although timely detection of causative pathogens of UTIs is important, rapid and accurate measures assisting UTI diagnosis and bacterial determination are poorly developed. By reading infrared spectra of urine samples, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) may help detect urine compounds, but its role in UTI diagnosis remains uncertain. In this pilot study, we proposed a characterization method in attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectra to evaluate urine samples and assessed the correlation between ATR-FTIR patterns, UTI diagnosis, and causative pathogens. We enrolled patients with a catheter-associated UTI in a subacute-care unit and non-UTI controls (total n = 18), and used urine culture to confirm the causative pathogens of the UTIs. In the ATR-FTIR analysis, the spectral variation between the UTI group and non-UTI, as well as that between various pathogens, was found in a range of 1800C900 cm(?1), referring to the presence of specific constituents of the bacterial cell wall. The results indicated that the relative ratios between different area zones of vibration, as well as multivariate analysis, can be used as a clue to discriminate between UTI and non-UTI, as well as different causative pathogens of UTIs.

Using structural equation modeling, a mediation model was developed to test the mediating effect of CPD on the association between social impact and sleep disturbance. After estimating with the stepwise and bootstrap regression, higher levels of CPD were associated with higher levels of social anxiety and subjects without a regular diet. Sleep disturbance was associated with a higher level of social anxiety, a history of psychological trauma, chronic disease, and those who did not smoke. The final model confirmed the mediating effects of CPD; whereas, the direct effect from social impact to sleep disturbance did not reach statistical significance.

All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide \\"breakpoint sequences\\", similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure.

The present study investigated depressive symptoms and their associated factors in older adult Rohingya FDMNs in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A total of 416 older adults aged 60 years and above residing in Rohingya camps situated in the South Eastern part of Bangladesh were interviewed using a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) in Bengali language. Chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms within different categories of a variable and a binary logistic regression model was performed to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: More than 41% of Rohingya older adults had depressive symptoms (DS).

However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020, and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. The primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were the (1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and (2) need for high levels of oxygen supplementation (HiO(2)). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [odds ratio (OR) 0.4, confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.9, p=.04], HiO(2) [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8), p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05), p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO(2) were seen with advancing age. African Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe illness and HiO(2) when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis.

The ante-mortem diagnosis of FIP in clinical cases is still challenging. In cats without effusion, a definitive diagnosis can only be achieved post mortem or with invasive methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a combined reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and sequencing approach in the diagnosis of FIP, detecting mutations at two different nucleotide positions within the spike (S) gene. Methods The study population consisted of 64 cats with confirmed FIP and 63 cats in which FIP was initially suspected due to similar clinical or laboratory signs, but that were definitively diagnosed with another disease. Serum/plasma and/or effusion samples of these cats were examined for feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA by RT-nPCR and, if positive, PCR products were sequenced for nucleotide transitions within the S gene. Results Specificity of RT-nPCR was 100% in all materials (95% confidence interval [CI] in serum/plasma 83.9-100.0; 95% CI in effusion 93.0-100.0). The specificity of the sequencing step could not be determined as none of the cats of the control group tested positive for FCoV RNA. Sensitivity of the 'combined RT-nPCR and sequencing approach' was 6.5% (95% CI 0.8-21.4) in serum/plasma and 65.3% (95% CI 50.4-78.3) in effusion. Conclusions and relevance A positive result is highly indicative of the presence of FIP, but as none of the control cats tested positive by RT-nPCR, it was not possible to confirm that the FCoV mutant described can only be found in cats with FIP. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the usefulness of the sequencing step including FCoV-RNA-positive cats with and without FIP.

The median age of the patients was 66 years (range 48-75 years), and their median BMI was 22.3 kg/m2 (range 17.7-26.8 kg/m2). One (12.5 %) of eight patients was female. A thin caliber trocar MiniPort? (Covidien, New Haven, CT) was inserted at the left upper quadrant by puncture without incision. An assistant used Endo Relief? (Hope Denshi Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan) needlescopic forceps. In three cases, the pre-bent forceps (KTY-I, Adachi Industry Co. Ltd., Gifu, Japan) was introduced for surgeon's left hand. After the liver was retracted with a 2-0 Prolene suture, a distal subtotal resection of the stomach with D1+ or D2 lymph node dissection was performed. The Roux-en-Y method or Billroth-I anastomosis was used for reconstruction. The short-term patient outcomes were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of RPDG with POP. RESULTS We employed this technique without the use of additional trocars in every patient except one. No conversion to laparotomy was observed. Both the Endo Relief? forceps and prebent forceps were useful to maintain countertraction and keep triangulation. The median length of the operation was 374 (range, 268-420) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 45 (range, 5-180) ml. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was 32 (range 22-46). Neither major postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1,5 days.

Aim: This article scrutinises the remote teaching approaches that were put in place in Zimbabwe in response to the closure of schools during the COVID-19 lockdown. The article investigates how the adopted approaches were suitable for conditions in rural settings. Setting: The study looks at the challenges faced in the implementation of remote teaching during COVID-19 school closures in rural areas of Matabeleland provinces in Zimbabwe. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative phenomenological approach to analyse the teaching approaches that were put in place by the government and other stakeholders. Twenty teachers from 20 rural schools drawn equitably from two provinces, Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North, were interviewed on the shortcomings of these remote teaching approaches. Results: The results revealed that the remote teaching approaches that were put in place excluded learners in rural settings. This is because of the challenges in infrastructure, economic condition and restrictions on remote teaching approaches imposed by the government. Conclusion: As Zimbabwe is facing economic hardships and infrastructure development challenges, it was supposed to adopt emergency remote teaching instead of long-term approaches.

In this pre-registered study (https://osf.io/3f89m), we demonstrate that despite the challenges of remote learning, first year university students (N = 166) taking an online Science of Happiness course during the first term experienced positive benefits to mental well-being in comparison to a wait-list control group (N = 198) registered to take the course in the second term. Specifically, university students currently taking the course maintained their mental well-being over the semester relative to the wait-list control who showed a significant decline in well-being and increase in anxiety during the same period.

However, we did find evidence that prior interest in increasing well-being influenced the effects of the course; participants with lower well-being interest showed less of a benefit. Our results suggest that online psychoeducational courses might provide a relatively cheap, flexible, and efficient means of providing support as part of an integrated approach to student mental well-being.","output":"Evaluation of a credit-bearing online administered happiness course on undergraduates mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Some patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) present with abdominal symptoms. Abdominal manifestations of COVID on imaging are not yet established. The goal of this study was to quantify the frequency of positive findings on abdominopelvic CT in COVID-positive patients, and to identify clinical factors associated with positive findings to assist with imaging triage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included adult COVID-positive patients with abdominopelvic CT performed within 14 days of their COVID PCR nasal swab assay from 3/1/2020 to 5/1/2020. Clinical CT reports were reviewed for the provided indication and any positive abdominopelvic findings. Demographic and laboratory data closest to the CT date were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression model with binary outcome of having no reported positive abdominopelvic findings was constructed. RESULTS: Of 141 COVID-positive patients having abdominopelvic CT (average age 64 years [ 16], 91 [64%] women), 80 (57%) had positive abdominopelvic findings. Abdominal pain was the most common indication, provided in 54% (43/80) and 74% (45/61) of patients with and without reported positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.015). 70% (98/141) of patients overall had reported findings in the lung bases. Findings either typical or intermediate for COVID were reported in 50% (40/80) and 64% (39/61) of patients with and without positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.099). Of 80 patients with positive abdominopelvic findings, 25 (31%) had an abnormality of gastrointestinal tract, and 14 (18%) had solid organ infarctions or vascular thromboses. In multivariate analysis, age (OR 0.85, p = 0.023), hemoglobin (OR 0.83, p = 0.029) and male gender (OR 2.58, p = 0.032) were independent predictors of positive abdominopelvic findings, adjusted for race and Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSION: Abdominopelvic CT performed on COVID-positive patients yielded a positive finding in 57% of patients. Younger age, male gender, and lower hemoglobin were associated with higher odds of having reportable positive abdominopelvic CT findings.","output":"Abdominopelvic CT findings in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January ? just as COVID-19 was on the verge of being a worldwide pandemic ? the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and emergency medicine associations released a joint policy statement, ?Pediatric Readiness in Emergency Medical Services Systems,? designed to bolster the emergency medical system so that children are well cared for","output":"Pediatricians are ready for COVID-19 and other emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented unprecedented challenges and interruptions to education at all levels.

Clinical studies have shown that systemic reactions occur in up to 50% of vaccine recipients. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination could affect anticoagulation control, potentially leading to an increased risk of thrombotic events and bleeding complications. Aims This article investigates whether the BNT162b2 vaccine affects anticoagulation control in outpatients using vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Methods A case-crossover study was performed in a cohort of outpatient VKA users from four Dutch anticoagulation clinics who received a BNT162b2 vaccine. International normalized ratio (INR) results and VKA dosages before the first vaccination, the reference period, were compared with those after the first and second vaccination. Results A total of 3,148 outpatient VKA users were included, with a mean age (standard deviation) of 86.7 (8.7) years, of whom 43.8% were male, 67.0% used acenocoumarol, and 33.0% phenprocoumon. We observed a decrease of 8.9% of INRs within range in the standard intensity group (target INR 2.0C3.0). There was both an increased risk of supratherapeutic (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08C1.67]) and subtherapeutic levels (OR = 1.40 [95% CI 1.08C1.83]) after first vaccination. In the high-intensity group (target INR 2.5C3.5), the risk of a supratherapeutic INR was 2.3 times higher after first vaccination (OR = 2.29 [95% CI 1.22C4.28]) and 3.3 times higher after second vaccination (OR = 3.25 [95% CI 1.06C9.97]). Conclusion BNT162b2 was associated with an immediate negative effect on anticoagulation control in patients treated with VKAs, so it is advisable to monitor the INR shortly after vaccination, even in stable patients.","output":"The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Anticoagulation Control in Patients Using Vitamin K Antagonists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rtwas assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt= 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rtwas assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt= 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt= 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077C84,520 or 55,869C81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rtto an ideal level and control the infection.","output":"Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objectives 1) To identify challenges for conducting ongoing and future rehabilitation research during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to develop strategies that can support ongoing and future rehabilitation research.

Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Workshop transcript and field notes were cross-compared by 4 workshop facilitators from which 3 main categories emerged: 1) pandemic protocol adjustment, 2) participant accessibility, and 3) knowledge dissemination. Results 1) Pandemic protocol adjustment: Workshop participants identified concerns with transitioning pre- to post-pandemic research, such as variations in intervention protocols and psychometric properties of virtually guided outcome assessments. Strategies identified: Delivering toolkits containing equipment needed for virtually guided assessments, and their comprehensive psychometric evaluation prior to use. 2) Participant accessibility: Virtually guided rehabilitation research may present barriers to participation for some populations due to a lack of internet access and proficiency. Strategies identified: Including community stakeholders in the decision-making process to help guide the development of safe and feasible study protocols, and simplifying protocols to maintain participants adherence. 3) Knowledge dissemination: Virtually delivered conferences have required additional preparation time due to requirements of pre-recorded presentations, and hinder important conversations between conference attendees. Strategies identified: Researchers should account for delays in knowledge translation plans for funding applications, and conference organizers should consider hosting networking events for attendees.

DESIGN: Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We used multivariable regression with a generalised estimating equation accounting for country as a random effect to analyse the association of different medication classes with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use and/or death. RESULTS: 1439 cases from 47 countries were included (mean age 44.1 years, 51.4% men) of whom 112 patients (7.8%) had severe COVID-19. Compared with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist monotherapy, thiopurine monotherapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 4.08, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.61) and combination therapy with TNF antagonist and thiopurine (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 1.65 to 9.78) were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Any mesalamine/sulfasalazine compared with no mesalamine/sulfasalazine use was associated with an increased risk (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29). This risk estimate increased when using TNF antagonist monotherapy as a reference group (aOR 3.52, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.45).

The mechanisms why COVID-19 is a mild disease in some patients and progresses to a severe multi-organ and often fatal disease with respiratory failure are not known. Biomarkers that predict the course of disease are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate a large spectrum of established laboratory measurements. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from the prospective PULMPOHOM and CORSAAR studies were recruited and comprised 35 patients with COVID-19, 23 with conventional pneumonia, and 28 control patients undergoing elective non-pulmonary surgery. Venous blood was used to measure the serum concentrations of 79 proteins by Luminex multiplex immunoassay technology. Distribution of biomarkers between groups and association with disease severity and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The biomarker profiles between the three groups differed significantly with elevation of specific proteins specific for the respective conditions. Several biomarkers correlated significantly with disease severity and death. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis revealed a significant separation of the three disease groups and separated between survivors and deceased patients. Different models were developed to predict mortality based on the baseline measurements of several protein markers. A score combining IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, SCF and CA-9 was associated with significantly higher mortality (AUC 0.929). DISCUSSION: Several newly identified blood markers were significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19 (AAT, EN-RAGE, myoglobin, SAP, TIMP-1, vWF, decorin) or in patients that died (IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, SCF, CA-9).

Vaccines can prevent viral diseases, but few antiviral treatments are available to control evolving infections. Among new antiviral therapies, RNA interference (RNAi) has been the focus of intensive research. However, along with the development of efficient RNAi-based therapeutics comes the risk of emergence of resistant viruses. In this study, we challenged the in vitro propensity of a morbillivirus (peste des petits ruminants virus), a stable RNA virus, to escape the inhibition conferred by single or multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against conserved regions of the N gene. Except with the combination of three different siRNAs, the virus systematically escaped RNAi after 3 to 20 consecutive passages.

In addition, the costs and cost-effectiveness of the four surveillance strategies will be assessed. Further, this trial is supplemented by a qualitative component to determine the acceptability of each strategy. Findings will inform the choice of the most effective, acceptable and affordable strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, with the most effective and cost-effective strategy becoming part of the local public health departments current routine health surveillance activities. Investigating its everyday performance will allow us to examine the strategys applicability to real time prevalence prediction and the usefulness of the resulting information for local policy makers to implement countermeasures that effectively prevent future nationwide lockdowns. The authors would like to emphasize the importance and relevance of this study and its expected findings in the context of population-based disease surveillance, especially in respect to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In Germany, but also in many other countries, COVID-19 surveillance has so far largely relied on passive surveillance strategies that identify individuals with clinical symptoms, monitor those cases who then tested positive for the virus, followed by tracing of individuals in close contact to those positive cases. To achieve higher effectiveness in population surveillance and to reliably predict the course of an outbreak, screening and monitoring of infected individuals without major symptoms (about 40% of the population) will be necessary. While current testing capacities are also used to identify such asymptomatic cases, this rather passive approach is not suitable in generating reliable population-based estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers to allow any dependable predictions on the course of the pandemic. To better control and manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, current strategies therefore need to be complemented by an active surveillance of the wider population, i.e. routinely conducted testing and monitoring activities to identify and isolate infected individuals regardless of their clinical symptoms. Such active surveillance strategies will enable more effective prevention of the spread of the virus as they can generate more precise population-based parameters during a pandemic. This essential information will be required in order to determine the best strategic and targeted short-term countermeasures to limit infection spread locally. TRIAL DESIGN: This trial implements a cluster-randomised, two-factorial controlled, prospective, interventional, single-blinded design with four study arms, each representing a different SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance strategy. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible are individuals age 7 years or older living in Germanys Rhein-Neckar Region who consent to provide a saliva sample (all four arms) after completion of a brief questionnaire (two arms only). For the qualitative component, different samples of study participants and non-participants (i.e. eligible for study, but refuse to participate) will be identified for additional interviews. For these interviews, only individuals age 18 years or older are eligible. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Of the four surveillance strategies to be assessed and compared, Strategy A1 is considered the gold standard for prevalence estimation and used to determine bias in other arms. To determine the cost-effectiveness, each strategy is compared to status quo, defined as the currently practiced passive surveillance approach. Strategy A1: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). Strategy A2: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B1: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms and risk exposures. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the saliva sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B2: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. In each strategy, RT-LAMP positive samples are additionally analyzed with qPCR in order to minimize the number of false positives. MAIN OUTCOMES: The identification of the one best strategy will be determined by a set of parameters. Primary outcomes include costs per correctly screened person, costs per positive case, positive detection rate, and precision of positive detection rate. Secondary outcomes include participation rate, costs per asymptomatic case, prevalence estimates, number of asymptomatic cases per study arm, ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases per study arm, participant satisfaction. Additional study components (not part of the trial) include cost effectiveness of each of the four surveillance strategies compared to passive monitoring (i.e. status quo), development of a prognostic model to predict hospital utilization caused by SARS-CoV-2, time from test shipment to test application and time from test shipment to test result, and perception and preferences of the persons to be tested with regard to test strategies. RANDOMISATION: Samples are drawn in three batches of three continuous weeks. Randomisation follows a two-stage process. First, a total of 220 sampling points have been allocated to the three different batches. To obtain an integer solution, the Cox-algorithm for controlled rounding has been used. Afterwards, sample points have been drawn separately per batch, following a probability proportional to size (PPS) random sample. Second, for each cluster the same number of residential addresses is randomly sampled from the municipal registries (self-weighted sample of individuals). The 28,125 addresses drawn per municipality are then randomly allocated to the four study arms A1, A2, B1, and B2 in the ratio 5 to 2.5 to 14 to 7 based on the expected response rates in each arm and the sensitivity and specificity of the pre-screening tool as applied in strategy B1 and B2. Based on the assumptions, this allocation should yield 2500 saliva samples in each strategy. Although a municipality can be sampled by multiple batches and the overall number of addresses per municipality might vary, the number of addresses contacted in each arm is kept constant. BLINDING (MASKING): The design is single-blinded, meaning the staff conducting the SARS-CoV-2 tests are unaware of the study arm assignment of each single participant and test sample. SAMPLE SIZES: Total sample size for the trial is 10,000 saliva samples equally allocated to the four study arms (i.e. 2,500 participants per arm). For the qualitative component, up to 60 in-depth interviews will be conducted with about 30 study participants (up to 15 in each arm A and B) and 30 participation refusers (up to 15 in each arm A and B) purposefully selected from the quantitative study sample to represent a variety of gender and ages to explore experiences with admission or rejection of study participation. Up to 25 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive study participants will be purposefully selected to explore the way in which asymptomatic men and women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 give meaning to their diagnosis and to the dialectic between feeling concurrently healthy and yet also being at risk for transmitting COVID-19. In addition, 100 randomly selected study participants will be included to explore participants perspective on testing processes and implementation.

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 ? and 2.83 ? resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of -, -, -, and -coronavirus spikes.

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to 2 groups according to their frailty status: exercise training group (prefrail or frail; n = 21; 74.7 [4.5] y; 33.3% male) and control group (robust; n = 14; 73.1 [3.9] y; 42.9% male). The exercise training group followed a multicomponent training program focusing on muscle power: supervised (5 wk) and unsupervised (6 wk). The primary outcomes, including PA and sitting time, perceived disability, and HRQoL, were assessed at the baseline and after 11 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of confinement, there were significant decreases in PA in both groups (P < .05). Thus, sitting time increased more in the control group than in the exercise training group (P < .05). The HRQoL measures remained unchanged.

Methods We conducted annual cross-sectional carriage and vaccination coverage surveys between 2016 and 2020 in rural and urban sites in Nigeria. We recruited a random sample of residents and used WHO-recommended laboratory methods to identify pneumococcal serotypes. We modelled prevalence ratios for the change in annual carriage prevalence using log-binomial regression, and explored the association between vaccination coverage in children <5 years and changes in the population-level vaccine-serotype carriage over time. Findings We enrolled 4,684 and 3,653 participants for the carriage surveys and 2,135 and 1,106 children for the coverage surveys in the rural and urban sites, respectively. Carriage prevalence of vaccine-serotypes declined steadily with increasing levels of PCV10 coverage among children aged <5 years.

We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time) and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this FLLN, the joint evolution of the mean infectivity and of the proportion of susceptible individuals is determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then obtain expressions for the evolution of the proportions of exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non-Markovian) branching process and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of nonextinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations.

Recently, the Acetabular Defect Classification (ADC) has been introduced to provide a reliable, reproducible and intuitive classification system. In order to improve ease of use and efficiency of the ADC, a browser-based application has been created. We hypothesized that the ADC application can improve rating performance of non-specialists (medical students) to achieve good inter- and intra-rater agreement and will compare favorable to the results of specialists (experienced surgeons) without the help of the application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ADC is based on the integrity of the acetabular rim and the supporting structures. It consists of four main types of defects ascending in severity. These defects are further subdivided in ACC, narrowing down defect location. 80 randomized radiographs were graded according to ADC by three non-specialists (medical students) with help of the ADC application and by three specialists (orthopedic surgeons) without help of the application to evaluate the difference in inter-rater agreement between groups. To account for intra-rater agreement, the rating process was repeated after a reasonable wash-out period. RESULTS: Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement within the non-specialist group rated lower when compared to the specialist group while still falling into the good agreement range. The student group presented with k values of 0.61 for inter-rater agreement and 0.68 for intra-rater agreement, while the surgeon group displayed k values of 0.72 for inter-rater agreement and 0.83 for intra-rater agreement. CONCLUSION: The app-guided assessment of acetabular defects offers a promising innovative approach to simplify complex situations. It makes the challenging field of acetabular revision arthroplasty more approachable especially for less experienced surgeons and offers insight and guidance in the planning stage as well as intra-operative setting.","output":"APP-guided assessment of acetabular defects in hip revision arthroplasty: a structured approach to a complex situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study design: Saliva has been proposed as valid alternative for nasopharyngeal swab for RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Recently, postoperative acute pancreatitis (POAP), a new concept for a pancreatic-specific complication following pancreatic resection, has been advocated, and its association with POPF has been reported. The present study examined the clinical features of POAP and identified the associations of POAP with POPF and other postoperative morbidities in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients undergoing pancreatic resection. METHODS A total of 312 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC at our institution from 2013 to 2019 were enrolled in this study. POAP was defined as an elevated serum amylase level above the upper limit normal on postoperative day (POD) 0 or 1, based on Connor's definition. The severity of POPF was assessed by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery definition. RESULTS A total of 184 patients (58.9%) had POAP. POAP occurred in 58.5% of subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy patients and 60% of distal pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy patients. The presence of POAP was significantly associated with the development of clinically relevant POPF, higher rates of severe morbidity, and a prolonged hospital stay after pancreatic resection. A multivariate analysis showed that the presence of POAP and elevated C-reactive protein levels on POD 3 were independent predictors of clinically relevant POPF after subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. CONCLUSIONS POAP is associated with the development of POPF, higher rates of severe morbidity, and a prolonged hospital stay after pancreatic resection and is an independent risk factor for clinically relevant POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy.

Its best-characterized function is to bind CpG dinucleotides present in viral RNAs and, through the recruitment of TRIM25, KHNYN and other cofactors, target them for degradation or prevent their translation. The long and short isoforms of ZAP (ZAP-L and ZAP-S) have different intracellular localization and it is unclear how this regulates their antiviral activity against viruses with different sites of replication. Using ZAP-sensitive and ZAP-insensitive human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), which transcribe the viral RNA in the nucleus and assemble virions at the plasma membrane, we show that the catalytically inactive poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) domain in ZAP-L is essential for CpG-specific viral restriction. Mutation of a crucial cysteine in the C-terminal CaaX box that mediates S-farnesylation and, to a lesser extent, the residues in place of the catalytic site triad within the PARP domain, disrupted the activity of ZAP-L. Addition of the CaaX box to ZAP-S partly restored antiviral activity, explaining why ZAP-S lacks antiviral activity for CpG-enriched HIV-1 despite conservation of the RNA-binding domain. Confocal microscopy confirmed the CaaX motif mediated localization of ZAP-L to vesicular structures and enhanced physical association with intracellular membranes. Importantly, the PARP domain and CaaX box together jointly modulate the interaction between ZAP-L and its cofactors TRIM25 and KHNYN, implying that its proper subcellular localisation is required to establish an antiviral complex. The essential contribution of the PARP domain and CaaX box to ZAP-L antiviral activity was further confirmed by inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, compartmentalization of ZAP-L on intracellular membranes provides an essential effector function in ZAP-L-mediated antiviral activity against divergent viruses with different subcellular replication sites.","output":"S-farnesylation is essential for antiviral activity of the long ZAP isoform against RNA viruses with diverse replication strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the overall education system in general and medical education in particular.

These nodes may be separated by a few microns or on planetary scale distances, but transmission losses due to absorption and/or scattering in the channel are the major source of error for most distributed quantum information tasks. Of course, quantum error correction (QEC) and detection techniques can be used to mitigate such effects, but error detection approaches have severe performance limitations due to the signaling constraints between nodes, and so error correction approaches are preferable-assuming one has sufficient high quality local operations. Typically, performance comparisons between loss-mitigating codes assume one encoded qubit per photon. However, single photons can carry more than one qubit of information and so our focus in this Letter is to explore whether loss-based QEC codes utilizing quantum multiplexed photons are viable and advantageous, especially as photon loss results in more than one qubit of information being lost. We show that quantum multiplexing enables significant resource reduction, in terms of the number of single-photon sources, while at the same time maintaining (or even lowering) the number of 2-qubit gates required.

One common measure taken to contain or reduce diffusion is to detect infected individuals and trace their prior contacts so as to then selectively isolate any individuals likely to have been infected. These prior contacts can be traced using mobile devices such as smartphones or smartwatches, which can continuously collect the location and contacts of their owners by using their embedded localisation and communications technologies, such as GPS, Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these technologies and determines the impact of contact tracing precision on the spread and control of infectious diseases. To this end, we have created an epidemic model that we used to evaluate the efficiency and cost (number of people quarantined) of the measures to be taken, depending on the smartphone contact tracing technologies used. Our results show that in order to be effective for the COVID-19 disease, the contact tracing technology must be precise, contacts must be traced quickly, and a significant percentage of the population must use the smartphone contact tracing application. These strict requirements make smartphone-based contact tracing rather ineffective at containing the spread of the infection during the first outbreak of the virus.

A key way in which Kkiri (a Mori health provider) responded was through the establishment of a ptaka kai (foodbank) that also provided a gateway to assess need and deliver other support services to whnau (in this case, client). Mori values were integral to this approach, with manaakitanga (kindness or providing care for others) at the heart of Kkiris actions. We sought to identify how Kkiri operated under the mantle of manaakitanga, during Aotearoas 2020 nationwide COVID-19 lockdown and to assess the impact of their contributions on Mori whnau. METHODS: We used qualitative methods underpinned by Mori research methodology. Twenty-six whnau interviews and two focus groups were held, one with eight kaimahi (workers) and the other with seven rangatahi (youth) kaimahi. Data was gathered between June and October 2020 (soon after the 2020 lockdown restrictions were lifted), thematically analysed and interpreted using a Mori worldview. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified that aligned to the values framework that forms the practice model that Kkiri kaimahi work within. Kaitiakitanga, whnau and manaakitanga are also long-standing Mori world values. We identified that kaitiakitanga (protecting) and manaakitanga (with kindness) - with whnau at the centre of all decisions and service delivery - worked as a protective mechanism to provide much needed support within the community Kkiri serves.

Methods: The team used the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) research prioritization method to identify research priorities in maternal and newborn health in Africa. From 609 research options, a ranking of the top 46 research questions was achieved. Research priority scores and agreement statistics were calculated, with sub-analysis possible for the regions of East Africa, West Africa and those living out of the continent. Results: The top research priorities generally fell into (i) improving identification of high-risk mothers and newborns, or diagnosis of high-risk conditions in mothers and newborns to improve health outcomes; (ii) improving access to treatment through improving incentives to attract and retain skilled health workers in remote, rural areas, improving emergency transport, and assessing health systems' readiness; and (iii) improving uptake of proven existing interventions such as Kangaroo Mother Care. Conclusions: The research priorities emphasized building interventions that improved access to quality healthcare in the lowest possible units of the provision of MNH interventions. The lists prioritized participation of communities in delivering MNH interventions.

Among them, 565 had performed sperm analysis or ovarian reserve tests in the past three months and were involved for further analyses. Sperm parameters were examined with a computer-assisted sperm analysis system, and serum anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) and sex hormones were tested with an electrochemiluminescence method. RESULTS Among 363 patients who underwent the sperm test, 136 (37.47%) had HP infection. Among 202 patients who underwent the AMH test, 55 (27.23%) had HP infection. There was no difference in sperm concentration and motility between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses stratified into 5-year age groups confirmed that there was no significant difference in sperm parameters (P > 0.05). When pooled with previously published data, no significant difference in sperm concentration or motility was found (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, this study found that the serum AMH level was similar between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses confirmed that there was no significant difference in serum AMH level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS There were no differences in sperm parameters and AMH levels based on history of HP infection among Chinese patients.","output":"Sperm parameters and anti-Mllerian hormone remain stable with Helicobacter pylori infection: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Common allergy clinic procedures, including oral food challenges and subcutaneous immunotherapy, carry a risk of anaphylaxis, the treatment for which is epinephrine. Our goal was to develop a standardized process for the management and documentation of allergic reactions that occur in a tertiary care pediatric allergy clinic. METHODS: This was a single institution quality improvement pilot study. A multidisciplinary team from the allergy department designed, implemented, and studied the use of a standardized form for the documentation and treatment of allergic reactions within the clinic. RESULTS: A standardized form was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for the management of allergic reactions and included space for documentation. Both clinic providers and staff approved the form. One year after the introduction, we reached 100% adherence for the use of the form in visits during which a patient experienced a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Two patients required transfer to the emergency room; the quality improvement form was utilized in these cases to document treatment and assist with the hand-off to emergency room personnel before transfer. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a standardized form for the treatment and documentation of anaphylaxis within our allergy clinic. The next steps focus on further integrating this form into the electronic medical record, determining compliance with evidence-based management of anaphylaxis, and formally assessing the use of the form as a handoff tool in the event of patient transfer.","output":"Establishing Standardized Documentation for Anaphylaxis Treatment in a Tertiary Care Pediatric Allergy Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Burgeoning evidence suggests that loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic is tied to high levels of depression and anxiety. The current study is unique, though, in examining which facets of social behavior and perceived social quality are most tied to internalizing symptoms using longitudinal data, including a pre-pandemic baseline, collected from a community sample of adults with pre-existing mental health concerns (analyzed n = 144). Methods. Participants completed measures of depressive and anxious symptoms pre-pandemic, followed by three weekly surveys during the pandemic. We distinguished four social variables: in-person social engagement, remote social engagement, social disruption, and social distress. OLS and mixed-effects regression models examined 1) pre-pandemic baseline symptoms as predictors of social functioning during the pandemic and 2) time-lagged associations between symptoms and social functioning during the pandemic. Results. Social behavior and social perceptions were dissociable. Baseline depressive, but not anxious, symptoms predicted greater social distress during the pandemic. Both anxious and depressive symptoms were predicted by social variables, but the specific associations differed: depressive symptoms were related to perceived social quality, whereas anxious symptoms were more tied to reported social behavior. Limitations. We relied on self-report indices, and causality should not be inferred directly from these correlational data. Conclusions. Overall, our results indicate that it is possible to follow social guidelines and even to spend relatively few hours socializing with close others, while still feeling connected and rewarded; however, people who struggle with depression and anhedonia were particularly vulnerable to distressing feelings of social disconnection amid the pandemic.","output":"Longitudinal associations between internalizing symptoms, social behavior, and social perceptions in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a transdiagnostic community sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an incoming IUPAB Councilor, I have been asked to write a short commentary describing myself and my career in science.

After cochlear implantation, auditory training is necessary for the brain to adapt to new auditory signals transmitted by the cochlear implant (CI). To date, auditory training is conducted in a face-to-face setting at a specialized center. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on health care, the need for new therapeutic settings has intensified. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility of a novel teletherapeutic auditory rehabilitation platform in adult CI recipients and compare the clinical outcomes and economic benefits of this platform with those derived from conventional face-to-face rehabilitation settings in a clinic. METHODS: In total, 20 experienced adult CI users with a mean age of 59.4 (SD 16.3) years participated in the study. They completed 3 weeks of standard (face-to-face) therapy, followed by 3 weeks of computer-based auditory training (CBAT) at home. Participants were assessed at three intervals: before face-to-face therapy, after face-to-face therapy, and after CBAT. The primary outcomes were speech understanding in quiet and noisy conditions. The secondary outcomes were the usability of the CBAT system, the participants' subjective rating of their own listening abilities, and the time required for completing face-to-face and CBAT sessions for CI users and therapists. RESULTS: Greater benefits were observed after CBAT than after standard therapy in nearly all speech outcome measures. Significant improvements were found in sentence comprehension in noise (P=.004), speech tracking (P=.004) and phoneme differentiation (vowels: P=.001; consonants: P=.02) after CBAT. Only speech tracking improved significantly after conventional therapy (P=.007). The program's usability was judged to be high: only 2 of 20 participants could not imagine using the program without support. The different features of the training platform were rated as high. Cost analysis showed a cost difference in favor of CBAT: therapists spent 120 minutes per week face-to-face and 30 minutes per week on computer-based sessions. For CI users, attending standard therapy required an average of approximately 78 (SD 58.6) minutes of travel time per appointment. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed teletherapeutic approach for hearing rehabilitation enables good clinical outcomes while saving time for CI users and clinicians. The promising speech understanding results might be due to the high satisfaction of users with the CBAT program. Teletherapy might offer a cost-effective solution to address the lack of human resources in health care as well as the global challenge of current or future pandemics.","output":"Tablet-Based Telerehabilitation Versus Conventional Face-to-Face Rehabilitation After Cochlear Implantation: Prospective Intervention Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While hydrogen plays an ever-increasing role in modern society, nature has utilized hydrogen since a very long time as an energy carrier and storage molecule.

These conflicts in workClife scenarios, brought about by high work demands causing emotional exhaustion, can create a state of distress among the medical professionals. The present study investigates the association between workCfamily conflict (WFC), emotional intelligence (EI), and self-efficacy (SE) among medical practitioners during COVID-19 in Pakistan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study sample included 140 medical professionals from Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Cross-section correlational research design was used, and information was gathered employing online surveys through a purposive sampling technique. The scales utilized were the WFC, EI, and SE Scale. RESULTS: The current study hypothesized a significant relationship between workCfamily conflict, general self-efficacy (GSE) and emotional intelligence among medical practitioners during COVID-19 in Pakistan. The results showed that those with more family-to-work conflict had less EI and GSE. Furthermore, findings uncovered that there is a significant positive relationship between EI and GSE. CONCLUSION: The findings propose that it is important for medical professionals to have a high level of EI and GSE to navigate through the WFC more healthily. In future, awareness seminars could be arranged related to EI and its significance to stimulate the psychological well-being of medical professionals. Future studies could also consider other healthcare workers, including nurses and internees doing house jobs and other medical staff, as they are also exposed to several stresses due to the workload and family demands.","output":"WorkCFamily Conflict, Emotional Intelligence, and General Self-Efficacy Among Medical Practitioners During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and which has subseque","output":"Clinical Features, Treatment and Outcomes of 218 Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective, Multicenter Study Based on Clinical Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The effect of socioeconomic factors, ethnicity, and other variables, on the frequency of COVID-19 cases [morbidity] and induced deaths [mortality] at sub-population, rather than at individual levels, is only partially understood. Objective: To determine which county-level features best predict COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for a given county in the U.S. Design: A Machine-Learning model that predicts COVID-19 mortality and morbidity using county-level features, followed by a SHAP-values-based importance analysis of the predictive features. Setting: Publicly available data from various American government and news websites. Participants: 3,071 U.S. counties, from which 53 county-level features, as well as morbidity and mortality numbers, were collected. Measurements: For each county: Ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, mask usage, population density, age distribution, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, air quality indicators, presidential election results, ICU beds. Results: A Random Forest classifier produced an AUROC of 0.863 for morbidity prediction and an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. A SHAP-values-based analysis indicated that poverty rate, obesity rate, mean commute time to work, and proportion of people that wear masks significantly affected morbidity rates, while ethnicity, median income, poverty rate, and education levels, heavily influenced mortality rates. The correlation between several of these factors and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, from 4/2020 to 11/2020 shifted, probably due to COVID-19 being initially associated with more urbanized areas, then with less urbanized ones. Limitations: Data are still coming in. Conclusions: Ethnicity, education, and economic disparity measures are major factors in predicting the COVID-19 mortality rate in a county. Between-counties low-variance factors (e.g., age), are not meaningful predictors.

Distance refers to any nontraditional assessment feature, not only or necessarily location. We conducted a systematic review to examine the psychometric soundness of these approaches. METHOD We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, AgeLine, and Academic Search Premier for articles published between January 2008 and June 2020. Studies were included if participants were over the age of 50, a structured assessment of cognitive function in older adults was evaluated, the assessment method was deemed distant, and validity and/or reliability data were reported. Assessment distance was defined as having any of the following features: use of an electronic test interface, nonroutine test location (e.g., home), test self-administered, and test unsupervised. Distance was categorized as low, intermediate, or high. RESULTS/DISCUSSION Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from n = 8 to 8,627, and the mean age ranged from 57 to 83. Assessments included screens, brief or full batteries, and were performed via videoconferencing, phone, smartphone, or tablet/computer. Ten studies reported on low distance, 11 on intermediate distance, and 5 studies for high distance assessments. Invalid performance data were observed with older age and cognitive impairment. Convergent validity data were reported consistently and suggested a decline with increasing distance: r = 0.52-0.80 for low, 0.49-0.75 for intermediate, and 0.41-0.53 for high distance. Diagnostic validity estimates presented a similar pattern. Reliability data were reported too inconsistently to allow evaluation. CONCLUSION The validity of cognitive assessments with older adults appears supported at lower but not higher distance. Less is known about the reliability of such assessments.

Climate change impacts human health both directly and indirectly, through extreme weather events, changing distribution of health risks, increased risks of undernutrition, population displacement, and greater risks of injuries, disease, and death (Ebi, K., Campbell-Lendrum, D., & Wyns, A. The 1. 5 health report. WHO. 2018). This risk amplification is likely to increase the need for humanitarian support. Recent projections indicate that under a business as usual scenario of sustained greenhouse gas emissions, climate change could double the demand for humanitarian assistance by 2050 (World Health Organization. Operational Framework for building climateresilient health systems. WHO. 2015). Humanitarian assistance is currently not meeting the existing needs, therefore, any additional burden is likely to be highly challenging.Global health advocates, researchers, and policymakers are calling for urgent action on climate change, yet there is little clarity on what that action practically entails for humanitarian organizations. While some humanitarian organizations may consider themselves well designed to respond, climate change as a transversal threat requires the incorporation of a resilience approach to humanitarian action and policy responses.By bringing together authors from two historically disparate fields - climate change and health, and humanitarian assistance - this paper aims to increase the capacity of humanitarian organizations to protect health in an unstable climate by presenting an adapted framework. We adapted the WHO operational framework for climate-resilient health systems for humanitarian organizations and present concrete case studies to demonstrate how the framework can be implemented. Rather than suggest a re-design of humanitarian operations we recommend the application of a climate-lens to humanitarian activities, or what is also referred to as mainstreaming climate and health concerns into policies and programs. The framework serves as a starting point to encourage further dialogue, and to strengthen collaboration within, between, and beyond humanitarian organizations.","output":"'Calibrating to scale: a framework for humanitarian health organizations to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and manage climate-related health risks'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examination of the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve represents a method to noninvasively describe lung and airway function in health and disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in pulmonary dysfunction and may result in changes to the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve during the recovery period following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Purpose The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine the shape and the area of the maximum expiratory flow volume curve in otherwise healthy, young adults during the three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21  1 y, height: 174.9  11.2 cm, body mass index: 23.6  1.6 kg?m-2) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 completed spirometry testing on three occasions. The first visit (BL) took place three-to-four weeks after positive test confirmation. Approximately four weeks separated each subsequent visit (1M and 2M, respectively). Following each spirometry test, the flow-volume loop with the greatest sum of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second was chosen for analysis. The angle beta (?) and flow ratio were calculated using standard pulmonary function parameters. Slope ratios at increments of 5% of FVC were determined from 80% to 20% FVC. Additionally, the area under the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve was calculated. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. Results FVC remained similar over the study period (p &gt; 0.05). The ? was significantly reduced at 2M compared with BL (BL: 188.8  15.7, 1M: 180.9  6.9;2M: 176.8  5.0, p = 0.012). Flow ratios were similar between visits (BL: 20.3  11.7%, 1M: 13.0  6.4%, 2M: 18.1  5.9%;p = 0.53). Additionally, the slope ratios at each lung volume were similar between visits. However, while not statistically different, the slope ratio at 80% FVC approached significance (BL: 1.22  0.98, 1M: 2.37  1.00, 2M: 2.13  0.86;p = 0.07). The total area under the maximum flow-volume curve was not different between visits (BL: 21.0  5.1 L2?s-1, 1M: 21.5  4.5 L2?s-1;2M: 21.9  4.7 L2?s-1;p = 0.49). The percentages of the total area under the curve that were contained between peak expiratory flow (PEF) and 75% FVC and between 50% FVC and 25% FVC were altered at 1M and 2M compared with BL (p &lt; 0.05). PEF tended to be greater during 2M compared with BL (BL: 8.49  1.34 L2?s-1, 1M: 9.34  1.92 L2?s-1, 2M: 9.44  1.53 L2?s-1;p = 0.056) and the changes in PEF from BL to 2M were significantly correlated with the changes in ? and area under the curve subdivisions over the same time period (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion These data demonstrate that the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve changes marginally during the initial three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, the changes appear to be largely driven by increases in peak expiratory flow and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is acutely involved in large airway dysfunction.","output":"Longitudinal

These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In the effort of preserving both public health and the economical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partially released lockdown measures. Here, we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemic in both countries using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where parameters are stochastically perturbed with a lognormal distribution to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and to simulate the presence of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemic leading or not to a second wave of infections. Furthermore, the presence of super-spreaders adds instability to the dynamics, making the control of the epidemic more difficult. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of the order of 10106 units in both countries.","output":"Modeling the second wave of COVID-19 infections in France and Italy via a stochastic SEIR model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background: Severe disease due to COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with hypercoagulation. Early identification of prothrombotic patients may help guiding anticoagulant treatment and improve survival. The aim of this study was to assess Rotational Thromboelastmetry (ROTEM) as a marker of coagulopathy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a prospective, observational study. Patients hospitalized due to a COVID-19 infection were eligible for inclusion. Conventional coagulation tests and ROTEM were taken after hospital admission, and patients were followed for 30 days. Patient characteristics and outcome variables were collected, and a prediction model including variables age, respiratory frequency and ROTEM EXTEM-MCF, was developed using logistic regression to evaluate the probability of death. Results: Out of the 141 patients included, 18 (13%) died within 30 days. D-dimer (p=0.01) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) (p=0.002) were increased, and ROTEM EXTEM-/INTEM-CT (p<0.001) were prolonged in non-survivors. In the final prediction model, the risk of death within 30 days for a patient hospitalized due to COVID-19 was increased with increased age, respiratory frequency and EXTEM-MCF. Longitudinal ROTEM data in the severely ill subpopulation showed enhanced hypercoagulation. In our in vitro analysis, no heparin effect on EXTEM-CT was observed, supporting a SARS-CoV-2 effect on initiation of coagulation. Conclusions: Here we show that hypercoagulation measured with ROTEM predicts 30-day mortality in COVID-19. Longitudinal ROTEM data strengthen the hypothesis of hypercoagulation as a driver of severe disease in COVID-19. Thus, ROTEM may be a useful tool to assess disease severity in COVID-19, and could potentially guide anticoagulation therapy.","output":"Hypercoagulation detected by Rotational Thromboelastometry predicts mortality in COVID-19: A risk model based on a prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study is to examine the long (5-year) efficacy of the all surface laser ablation (ASLA) combined with accelerated cross-linking (CXL) for the treatment of myopia without the use of mitomycin-C (MMC). METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 202 eyes of 118 myopic (SD: 2.41, range: ? 1.50 to ? 12.75 D) patients (44 males, 74 females). Mean age was 28.50 years (SD: 6.45, range: 18 to 51 years) that underwent ASLA with accelerated CXL for the treatment of their myopia. RESULTS: The patients underwent routine postoperative assessment on the 1st, 3rd, 7th day and in the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month, 30th month (6 months), 4th and 5th year. The mean spherical equivalent (SEq) refractive error changed from ? 6.41  2.41 D preoperatively to ? 0.02  0.53 D at 5 years postoperatively. The haze score was 0.18, 0.25 and 0.28 at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. At 12 months after the treatment, no eyes had significant corneal haze and in all the following postoperative time intervals the haze traces were gone. CONCLUSION: ASLA combined with accelerated CXL (ASLA-XTRA) appears to be safe, efficacious and offering very good refractive results. The potential additional benefits of this modality are the stabilizing effect of the refraction and its sterilization effect on the treated cornea without the potential side effects of MMC.","output":"5-year efficacy of all surface laser ablation with cross-linking (ASLA-XTRA) for the treatment of myopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance SARS-CoV-2 caused the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the world The virus belongs to the family of RNA-containing coronaviruses and is a representative of the Beta-CoV B line Epidemiological analysis shows that the disease is transmitted by airborne droplets, airborne dust and contact routes During dental treatment, patients are face-to-face with the doctor Coughing, sneezing, salivation and blood may occur when using an ultrasonic or high-speed handpiece If the patient is infected, then standard protective measures in everyday clinical work are not effective enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even if the patients are in an asymptomatic incubation period Purpose A generalization of colleagues knowledge and their own practical experience is necessary for the proper organization of the provision of dental care to patients and minimization of the risk of infection in a pandemic of a new coronavirus infection Materials and methods We analyzed the data of colleagues of dentists from different countries, and also presented our own understanding of the issues of dental care during a pandemic of a new coronavirus infection Results In conclusion: the main important steps in the implementation of dental practice are during a pandemic: the doctor's compliance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19);strict observance by the dentist and maxillofacial surgeon of the rules of their own safety;obtaining additional information from the history of possible risk factors for the patient;the correct use of the diagnostic algorithm depending on the pathology of the patient;the use of mainly disposable materials;flawless sterilization and disinfection of materials that are reused;competent aseptic processing of hands and mandatory work with gloves;prudent and proper use of personal protective equipment;disinfection measures;Class B medical waste disposal Conclusion Knowledge of the clinical manifestations of the new coronavirus infection and methods for preventing infection of patients and medical personnel is necessary for each dentist and maxillofacial surgeon to prevent new episodes of spread and provide quality medical care ܧѧݧߧ SARS-CoV-2 ѧ ڧڧߧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ (COVID-19)  ާڧ ڧ ߧڧ  ֧ާ֧ۧӧ -է֧اѧڧ ܧߧѧӧڧ  ӧݧ֧ ֧էѧӧڧ֧ݧ֧ ݧڧߧڧ Beta-CoV B ڧէ֧ާڧݧԧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧߧѧݧڧ ܧѧ٧ӧѧ֧,  ҧݧ֧٧ߧ ֧֧էѧ֧ ӧ٧էߧ-ܧѧ֧ݧߧ, ӧ٧էߧ-ݧ֧ӧ  ܧߧѧܧߧ ާ  ӧ֧ާ ާѧݧԧڧ֧ܧԧ ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ߧѧէ ݧڧ  ݧڧ  ӧѧ ا֧ ڧ٧ۧ ܧѧ֧ݧ, ڧѧߧڧ, ӧէ֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ݧߧ  ܧӧ  ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ ݧѧ٧ӧܧӧԧ ڧݧ ӧܧܧߧԧ ߧѧܧߧ֧ߧڧܧ ݧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ٧ѧѧا֧,  ѧߧէѧߧ ٧ѧڧߧ ާ֧  ӧ֧էߧ֧ӧߧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ѧҧ ߧ֧էѧߧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ էݧ ֧էӧѧ֧ߧڧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ COVID-19, էѧا ֧ݧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ߧѧէ  ҧ֧ڧާާߧ ڧߧܧҧѧڧߧߧ ֧ڧէ ֧ݧ ҧҧ֧ߧڧ ٧ߧѧߧڧ ܧݧݧ֧  ҧӧ֧ߧߧԧ ѧܧڧ֧ܧԧ  ߧ֧ҧէڧާ էݧ ѧӧڧݧߧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ܧѧ٧ѧߧڧ ާѧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ާ ѧڧ֧ߧѧ  ާڧߧڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ڧܧ ٧ѧѧا֧ߧڧ  ݧӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ѧ֧ڧѧݧ  ާ֧է ѧާ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧߧ էѧߧߧ ܧݧݧ֧ - ާѧݧԧ ѧ٧ߧ ѧ ѧܧا ֧էѧӧݧ֧ߧ ҧӧ֧ߧߧ ߧڧާѧߧڧ ӧ ܧѧ٧ѧߧڧ ާѧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ާ ӧ ӧ֧ާ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ֧٧ݧѧ ѧܧڧ ҧѧ٧, ߧӧߧާ ӧѧاߧާ ѧԧѧާ  ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ ާѧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ѧܧڧܧ  ֧ڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ӧݧ: ҧݧէ֧ߧڧ ӧѧ ֧ܧާ֧ߧէѧڧ ڧߧڧ֧ӧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧۧܧ ֧է֧ѧڧ  ڧݧѧܧڧܧ, էڧѧԧߧڧܧ  ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ (COVID-19);ԧ ҧݧէ֧ߧڧ ާѧݧԧ  ֧ݧߧ-ݧڧ֧ӧ ڧԧ ѧӧڧ ҧӧ֧ߧߧ ҧ֧٧ѧߧ;ݧ֧ߧڧ էݧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ڧߧާѧڧ ڧ ѧߧѧާߧ֧٧  ӧ٧ާاߧ ѧܧѧ ڧܧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ;ѧӧڧݧߧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ էڧѧԧߧڧ֧ܧԧ ѧݧԧڧާ  ٧ѧӧڧڧާ  ѧݧԧڧ ҧݧߧԧ;ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ ֧ڧާ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ էߧѧ٧ӧ ާѧ֧ڧѧݧ;ҧ֧٧֧ߧѧ ֧ڧݧڧ٧ѧڧ  է֧٧ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ާѧ֧ڧѧݧ, ܧ ڧݧ٧ ӧߧ;ԧѧާߧѧ ѧ֧ڧ֧ܧѧ ҧѧҧܧ   ҧ٧ѧ֧ݧߧѧ ѧҧ  ֧ѧܧѧ;ѧڧ֧ݧߧ  ѧӧڧݧߧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ ֧է ڧߧէڧӧڧէѧݧߧ ٧ѧڧ;ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ է֧٧ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧ ާ֧ڧڧ;ڧݧڧ٧ѧڧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧڧ է ܧݧѧ  ѧܧݧ֧ߧڧ ߧѧߧڧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ӧݧ֧ߧڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ  ާ֧է ڧݧѧܧڧܧ ٧ѧѧا֧ߧڧ ҧݧߧ  ާ֧էڧڧߧܧԧ ֧ߧѧݧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ էݧ ܧѧاէԧ ާѧݧԧ  ֧ݧߧ-ݧڧ֧ӧԧ ڧԧ էݧ ֧է֧اէ֧ߧڧ ߧӧ ڧ٧է ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ܧѧ٧ѧߧڧ ܧѧ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ާ","output":"Features of the work of a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon in a pandemic of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. METHODS: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. FINDINGS: Of 10a021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18-59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60-69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70-79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged &#8805;80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10a021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 135 days (SD 121). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory distress syndrome by targeting the lungs and also induces myocardial damage. Shenshao Ningxin Yin (SNY) has been used for more than 700 years to treat influenza. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that SNY can improve the clinical symptoms of viral myocarditis, reverse arrhythmia, and reduce the level of myocardial damage markers. METHODS This work uses a rational computational strategy to identify existing drug molecules that target host pathways for the treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis. Disease and drug targets were input into the STRING database to construct protein?protein interaction networks. The Metascape database was used for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULTS SNY signaling modulated the pathways of coronavirus disease, including COVID-19, Ras signaling, viral myocarditis, and TNF signaling pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were the pivotal targets of SNY. The components of SNY bound well with the pivotal targets, indicating there were potential biological activities.

In this study, an attempt was made to document the genome-wide codon usage profile and the various factors influencing the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in human and dog. The SARS-CoV-2 genome showed relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with A/U. The analysis of ENc-GC3s, Neutrality and Parity rule 2 plots indicated that natural selection and other undefined factors dominate the overall codon usage bias in SARS-CoV-2 whereas the impact of mutation pressure is comparatively minor.

The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence. RESULTS: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR.

COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe illness with acute respiratory distress requiring critical care in up to 40% of hospitalized patients. Numerous reports have identified COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) as an important infective complication of COVID-19. In the UK, the pandemic has had unprecedented impacts on the National Health Service (NHS'): each wave of infections required hospitals to reconfigure for large surges in patients requiring intensive care, to the detriment of most aspects of non-COVID care including planned operations, outpatient appointments, general practitioner consultations and referrals. The UK National Mycology Reference Laboratory (MRL) offers a comprehensive service for the diagnosis and management of fungal disease nationwide, with a test portfolio that includes: diagnosis of allergies to fungal and other respiratory allergens; diagnosis of superficial and invasive/systemic fungal infections using traditional mycological, serological and molecular approaches; identification and susceptibility testing of the causative fungi; therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving antifungal therapy. Here, we describe the impact of the first 14 months of the COVID-19 pandemic on MRL activities. Changes to MRL workload closely mirrored many of the NHS-wide challenges, with marked reductions in elective mycological activities unrelated to the pandemic and dramatic surges in tests that contributed to the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-related secondary fungal infections, in particular CAPA and candidemia in COVID-19 patients in intensive care.

The success of lung transplantation mainly depends on the quality and function of the implanted donor lungs, which are frequently subject to brain-death-induced lung injuries and intensive care unit (ICU)-related complications before transplantation. Recent innovations, particularly the development of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), in which donor lungs are ventilated and perfused under normothermic conditions outside the body, have allowed clinicians to more accurately assess the donor lung function prior to transplantation. Therefore, EVLP has been successfully translated into clinical practice with the expansion of the donor lung pool, leading to favorable post-transplant outcomes in a growing number of transplant centers worldwide. The EVLP system and techniques, following the Toronto protocol, have recently been applied for the assessment of extended criteria brain-death donors in clinical lung transplantation in Japan.

Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. RESULTS: We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. CONCLUSIONS: Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development.

However, a methodology to faithfully implement the CDC guideline, measure prescriber adherence, and systematically test its effect on patient and public health outcomes is lacking. We developed and tested a CDC Guideline implementation strategy (termed TOWER), focusing on an outpatient HIV-focused primary care setting. METHODS: TOWER was developed in a stakeholder-engaged, multi-step iterative process within an Information, Motivation and Behavioral Skills (IMB) framework of behavior change. TOWER consists of: 1) a patient-facing opioid management app (OM-App); 2) a progress note template (OM-Note) to guide the office visit; and 3) a primary care provider (PCP) training. TOWER was evaluated in a 9-month, randomized-controlled trial of HIV-PCPs (N = 11) and their patients with HIV and CP-LTOT (N = 40). The primary outcome was CDC Guideline adherence based on electronic health record (EHR) documentation and measured by the validated Safer Opioid Prescribing Evaluation Tool (SOPET). Qualitative data including one-on-one PCP interviews were collected. We also piloted patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) reflective of domains identified as important by stakeholders (pain intensity and function; mood; substance use; medication use and adherence; relationship with provider; stigma and discrimination). RESULTS: PCPs randomized to TOWER were 48% more CDC Guideline adherent (p < 0.0001) with significant improvements in use of: non-pharmacologic treatments, functional treatment goals, opioid agreements, prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), opioid benefit/harm assessment, and naloxone prescribing. Qualitative data demonstrated high levels of confidence in conducting these care processes among intervention providers, and that OM-Note supported these efforts while experience with OM-App was mixed. There were no intervention-associated safety concerns (defined as worsening of any of the PROMs). CONCLUSIONS: CDC-guideline adherence can be promoted and measured, and is not associated with worsening of outcomes for people with HIV receiving LTOT for CP. Future work would be needed to document scalability of these results and to determine whether CDC-guideline adherence results in a positive effect on public health.

Because no randomized clinical trial has examined the effects of omega-3 consumption in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes; the present study aims to close this gap. METHODS: This investigation is a randomized clinical trial, in which sixty adolescents with type 1 diabetes will be randomly assigned to receive either omega-3 (600 mg/day) or placebo capsules for 12 weeks. Evaluation of anthropometric parameters, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as an endothelial function marker, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as a vascular structure marker, proteinuria, biochemical factors including glycemic and lipid profile, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as well as blood pressure will be done at the baseline and end of the trial. Also, dietary intake and physical activity will be assessed throughout the study. Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS software (Version 24), and P < 0.05 will be considered statistically meaningful.

In comparison to the period not affected by COVID-19 measures, mean concentrations of pollutants were increased during the first lockdown period; when the number of COVID-19 patients increased sharply compared to the other periods, the mean surface concentrations of NO2, SO2, and CO were decreased and concentrations of other pollutants (i.e., O3, PM10, and PM2.5) were increased during the second lockdown period compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In the third period, the mean concentrations were decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2019. For the full period, decreases in mean concentrations of O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and PM10 and increases in PM2.5 were observed during the COVID-19 crisis, compared to 2019. Overall, the strongest reductions, 12% and 6%, respectively, were observed for CO and NO2, pointing to reduced emissions from traffic as a result of lockdown measures. The concentrations of other pollutants changed little, suggesting that the lockdown measures did not result in strong changes in the emissions from stationary sources.","output":"Changes in short-lived climate pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Blood coagulation assays are colossally important for clinical evaluation of palliative chemotherapy; however, this niche was not explored earlier for advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Study focuses to explore the clinical relevancy of Coagulation assays; prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), D-dimer and international normalised ratio (INR) and their response to palliative chemotherapy in advanced stage NSCLC. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between 2013 and 2019 in Jiangsu Cancer hospital, Nanjing, PR. China. Medical records of 5445 patients were succinctly reviewed and classified accordingly to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 216 advanced NSCLC patients who used a first line chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy regimen were enrolled in this study under ethical approval (JSCH-2020C-009). Blood samples were collected from these patients to measure the response levels of these coagulation parameters at time of admission to hospital and at the beginning of 4 cycles of Palliative therapy. We find the clinical value of all these coagulation parameters by using SPSS 24. Univariate Cox regression and Multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify the factors that were associated with progression free survival (PFS) and the response to palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS: In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for overall median (95%CI) survival of high pre-treatment coagulation parameters showed shorter PFS compared to normal pre-treatment except TT and their overall median (95%CI) follow up was 3.3(3.12-3.47). Coagulation parameters have showed clinical relevance as a potential independent prognostic factor of PFS in the Univariate Cox regression. In multivariable model, Age (&#8805; 60 years vs. <60 years), cancer differentiation (Unknown vs. Poor), PT (High vs. Normal) range, FIB (High vs. Normal) range, and D-dimer (High vs. Normal) range, (p = 0.025, p = 0.045, p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.011 respectively) were associated as a prognostic factor of PFS in NSCLC. Patients on 3-drugs regimen found to have better PFS compared to the ones taking the 2-drugs treatment regimen (p= 0.043). CONCLUSION: The high range of PT, FIB, and D-dimers was associated with poor prognosis of advanced-stage NSCLC. Our findings also confirmed that patients on 3-drugs regimen showed longer PFS compared to 2-drugs regimen.","output":"Clinical Evaluation of Plasma Coagulation Parameters in Patients with Advanced-stage Non-small cell Lung Cancer Treated with Palliative Chemotherapy in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quick transformation of class activities to an online format in the middle of the term due to the pandemic of COVID-19 caused a lot of attention of educators worldwide.

Here, we have developed a green-emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520 nm (> 560-fold) when treated with 100 M H 2 S for 1 h. It is highly selective for H 2 S over biothiols (> 400-fold F / F 0 ) and has a detection limit of 12.9 nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H 2 S detection in vivo for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus-induced H 2 S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H 2 S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad-spectrum drug against RNA viruses.

Studies based on provisional data suggested that other high-income countries did not experience the large decrease in life expectancy observed in the US; this study sought to confirm these findings according to official death counts and to broaden the pool of comparison countries. OBJECTIVE: To calculate changes in US life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 by sex, race, and ethnicity and to compare those outcomes with changes in other high-income countries. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study involved a simulation of life tables based on national death and population counts for the US and 21 other high-income countries in 2019 and 2020, by sex, including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. Data were analyzed in January 2022. EXPOSURES: Official death counts from the US and 21 peer countries. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth and credible range (CR) based on 10% uncertainty. RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020, US life expectancy decreased by a mean of 1.87 years (CR, 1.70-2.03 years), with much larger decreases occurring in the Hispanic (3.70 years; CR, 3.53-3.87 years) and non-Hispanic Black (3.22 years; CR, 3.03-3.40 years) populations than in the non-Hispanic White population (1.38 years; CR, 1.21-1.54 years). The mean decrease in life expectancy among peer countries was 0.58 years (CR, 0.42-0.73 year) across all 21 countries. No peer country experienced decreases as large as those seen in the US. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Official death counts confirm that US life expectancy decreased between 2019 and 2020 on a scale not seen in 21 peer countries, substantially widening the preexisting gap in life expectancy between the US and peer countries. The decrease in US life expectancy was experienced disproportionately by Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, consistent with a larger history of racial and ethnic health inequities resulting from policies of exclusion and systemic racism. Policies to address the systemic causes of the US health disadvantage relative to peer countries and persistent racial and ethnic inequities are essential.","output":"Changes in Life Expectancy Between 2019 and 2020 in the US and 21 Peer Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not a guideline but a guidance is the motto of this document of guidance by the European Society of Cardiology, which is designed as an orientation aid to learning for physicians in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Many of these measures caused a sudden rupture in people's daily routines, thereby eliciting considerable uncertainty and potentially also hampering the satisfaction of individuals' psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Drawing upon Maslow's Hierarchical Need Theory and Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the unique role of felt insecurity and the psychological needs, as well as their dynamic interplay, in the prediction of mental health. A large and heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 5118; Mage = 43.45 years) was collected during the first ten days of the lockdown period in Flanders, Belgium. A subsample (N = 835, Mage = 41.39) participated during a second wave one week later. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that felt insecurity, need satisfaction and need frustration all independently predicted various positive (life satisfaction, sleep quality) and negative indicators depressive symptoms, anxiety) of mental health, with little systematic evidence for interactions between the predictors. The pattern of findings obtained concurrently largely held in the longitudinal analyses. Finally, results showed that associations between felt insecurity and lower concurrent and prospective mental health were partially mediated by need satisfaction and frustration, with especially psychological need frustration predicting changes in mental health over time. Overall, the findings suggest that satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is not just a 'luxury good'. Satisfaction of these needs is important also in times of insecurity, while need frustration represents a risk factor for maladjustment during such times.","output":"Do Psychological Needs Play a Role in Times of Uncertainty?

IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Preoperative identification of patients with high risk of recurrent disease might enable individualized treatment based on patients' risk profile. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of metabolic parameters derived from the pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT as imaging biomarkers for recurrent disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS Included in this retrospective study were all consecutive patients with CLM treated with percutaneous or open thermal ablation therapy who had a pre-treatment baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT available. Multivariable cox regression for survival analysis was performed using different models for the metabolic parameters (SULpeak, SULmean, SULmax, partial volume corrected SULmean (cSULmean), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)) corrected for tumour and procedure characteristics. The study endpoints were defined as local tumour progression free survival (LTP-FS), new intrahepatic recurrence free survival (NHR-FS) and extrahepatic recurrence free survival (EHR-FS). Clinical and imaging follow-up data was used as the reference standard. RESULTS Fifty-four patients with 90 lesions were selected. Univariable cox regression analysis resulted in eight models. Multivariable analysis revealed that after adjusting for lesion size and the approach of the procedure, none of the metabolic parameters were associated with LTP-FS or EHR-FS. Percutaneous approach was significantly associated with a shorter LTP-FS. It was demonstrated that lower values of SULpeak, SULmax, SULmean , and cSULmean are associated with a significant better NHR-FS, independent of the lesion size and number and prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION We found no association between the metabolic parameters on pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT and the LTP-FS. However, low values of the metabolic parameters were significantly associated with improved NHR-FS. The clinical implication of these findings might be the identification of high-risk patients who might benefit most from adjuvant or combined treatment strategies.","output":"18F-FDG PET as novel imaging biomarker for disease progression after ablation therapy in colorectal liver metastases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) social skills intervention has demonstrated effectiveness for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

RESULTS: Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P < .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention. Among the hospitalized children with HCoV detected, 39 (18.4%) received respiratory support and 24 (11.3%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Age <2 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9C13.1) and cardiovascular (OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6C9.5), genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1C7.0), and respiratory chronic complex conditions ([CCCs] OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.7C12.0) were associated with receiving respiratory support. Genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1C7.4) CCCs were associated with PICU admission. Severity of illness was similar among hospitalized children with different HCoV types. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the community with HCoV detected generally had mild illness as demonstrated by few medically attended cases. In hospitalized children, young age and CCCs, but not HCoV type, were associated with increased severity of illness.","output":"Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Human Coronaviruses in the Pediatric Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has become a global pandemic. Although the rate of new infections in China has decreased, currently, 169 countries report confirmed cases, with many nations showing increasing numbers daily. Testing for COVID-19 infection is performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but availability is limited in many parts of the world. The role of chest computed tomography is yet to be determined and may vary depending on the local prevalence of disease and availability of laboratory testing. A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19. Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis. In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection. Familiarity with these findings and their evolution will help radiologists recognize potential COVID-19 and recognize the significant overlap with other causes of acute lung injury.","output":"Computed Tomography Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review for Radiologists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upon recognition of microbial DNA or self-DNA, the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) of the host catalyzes the production of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. cGAMP is the main activator of STING, stimulator of interferon genes, leading to interferon synthesis through the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. STING is also a hub for activation of NF-&#954;B and autophagy. The present review details the striking similarities between T and B cell responses in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and both animal or human models of STING gain of function (SAVI syndromes: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy). Those similarities may be further clues for a delayed activation of STING in severe COVID-19 patients, due to DNA damages following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) infection and unusual role of STING in SARS-CoV-2 control. In early stages, Th2 differentiation are noticed in both severe COVID-19 and SAVI syndromes; then, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells functional exhaustion/senescent patterns due to TCR hyper-responsiveness are observed. T cell delayed over-responses can contribute to pneumonitis and delayed cytokine secretion with over-production of IL-6. Last, STING over-activation induces progressive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia in SAVI syndromes, which parallels what is observed in severe COVID-19. ACE2, the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is rarely expressed in immune cells, and it has not been yet proven that some human lymphocytes could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 or CD26. However, STING, expressed in humans T cells, might be triggered following excessive transfer of cGAMP from infected antigen presenting cells into activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lymphocytes. Indeed, those lymphocytes highly express the cGAMP importer SLC19A1. Whereas STING is not expressed in human B cells, B cells counts are much less affected, either in COVID-19 or SAVI syndromes. The recognition of delayed STING over-activation in severe COVID-19 patients could prompt to target STING with specific small molecules inhibitors already designed and/or aspirin, which inhibits cGAS.","output":"Lymphocyte Changes in Severe COVID-19: Delayed Over-Activation of STING?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinations against influenza viruses are widely used all over the world.

The aim of this global survey was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on surgical training and to develop a framework for recovery. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted. This was designed by a steering committee of medical educationalists and validated by a group of trainees before dissemination. RESULTS: A total of 608 responses were obtained from 34 countries and 15 specialties. The results demonstrated major disruption in all aspects of training. The impact was greatest for conferences (525 of 608) and hands-on courses (517 of 608), but less for inpatient care-related training (268 of 608). European trainees were significantly more likely to experience direct training disruption than trainees in Asia (odds ratio 0.15) or Australia (OR 0.10) (&#967;2 = 87.162, P < 0.001). Alternative training resources (webinars, 359 of 608; educational videos, 234 of 608) have emerged, although trainees expressed some dissatisfaction with them. The collective responses generated a four-pillar framework for training recovery that involved: guidance from training stakeholders with the involvement of trainees; prioritization of training, especially the roles of senior surgeons/trainers; provision of access to alternative/new teaching methods; and measures to address trainee anxiety.

Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus through social distancing and shelter-at-home edicts have unintended consequences upon clinical and educational missions and mental well-being of radiology departments. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residencies with respect to the educational mission and perceptions of impact on well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was IRB exempt. An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the APDR membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey? (San Mateo, California). RESULTS: Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8% (3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107).

SUMMARY: An 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a fall with complaints of pain in her knee, shoulder, and hip. Her medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, for which she took clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and atrial fibrillation, for which she took dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The physical exam was remarkable for pain within the shoulder, hip, and knee, which had swelling and ecchymosis that extended into the right thigh. Given the possibility of compartment syndrome with multiple possible etiologies of coagulopathy, TEG and computed tomography angiography (CTa) of the right lower extremity were performed. The initial TEG showed prolonged R time and activated clotting time, indicating clotting factor dysfunction with no additional coagulopathy noted, including antiplatelet effects. On the basis of the TEG and CTa findings, it was decided to reverse dabigatran with 5 grams of idarucizumab. Approximately 1 hour after administration of idarucizumab, the patient was taken to interventional radiology where a limited angiogram of the right lower extremity showed no active extravasation. Because of the patient's renal dysfunction and the possibility of rebound hypercoaguability, repeat TEG tests were ordered at 4 and 8 hours after the initial reversal to ensure clearance of idarucizumab-dabigatran complexes. The repeat TEG values showed complete reversal of the initial coagulopathy noted. During the admission, the patient required no blood transfusions or surgical interventions and all her initial laboratory results improved.

The most important of these co-morbidities that have consistently emerged in studies from across the globe, are the patients age and sex. Other important co-morbidities that adversely affect outcomes include pre-existing diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease and malignancy.

Therefore, the research problem was expressed in the form of a question: what tools favor the dynamic digital transformation of hotel functioning models and the implementation of the paradigm of intelligent and autonomous entities operating in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hotel market? During the empirical research, the use and implementation of new solutions in the field of innovative technologies supporting the optimization of processes taking place in hotel enterprises were considered. In addition, technologies and tools were identified that are considered strategic from the perspective of implementing the concept of an autonomous hotel carried out under the influence of the crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the specific purpose of the article, a survey was conducted using the questionnaire method with the Computer Assisted Web Interview technique alongside a self-developed questionnaire. The survey was carried out in JuneCSeptember 2021 among 462 representatives of hotel companies operating in the three-, four- and five-star standards. The results of the diagnostic survey were statistically analyzed using the Statistica and RStudio software packages. To interpret the obtained data, the descriptive method, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis were used. As a result of the conducted research, it was noticed that the COVID-19 pandemic obligated hotels to automate processes that made it possible to connect devices within digital ecosystems and to optimize processes inside vertical and horizontal value chains. Such activities enabled the creation of a new model of hotel functioning referred to as an autonomous enterprise. Nowadays, one of the most important strategic behaviors of hotel entities is the ability to quickly counteract crises resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related choice of the right course of action, as well as the ability to immediately make the right decisions. The research results may motivate the implementation of new technologies in the area of transforming and developing digital business models by hotels. The issues presented in the article are an attempt to fill the gap by pointing out practical experiences related to the use of individual technological solutions and their effectiveness in process automation and implementation of autonomous models of functioning of entities in the hotel services sector.","output":"Autonomous Enterprise as a Model of Hotel Operation in the Aftermath of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The release of the 24/7 Wall Street publication in November 2018 labeling the Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa, community as the worst city for Black Americans to live in the United States sparked conversations and calls to action across the community-from the kitchen table to the boardroom. It became clear that this was a critical moment for innovative leadership from public health. PROGRAM To bring together these individual efforts, and diverse perspectives, toward deeper understanding and system transformation, Black Hawk County Public Health, with support from Engaging Inquiry, adopted a participatory action approach of dynamic system mapping and systemic strategy design. IMPLEMENTATION Using participatory methodologies and tools for systems analysis, stakeholders developed a system map visualizing the patterns driving inequitable outcomes, but also the bright spots and resiliencies, identified and experienced across the community. This map, populated with local stories and data, represents a \\"theory of context,\\" and offered a foundation of understanding and connectivity upon which high-impact opportunities for engagement could be identified and developed. By working across sectors and building on existing energy and resources present within the community, systemic strategies were designed to foster critical shifts toward a healthier community. EVALUATION A developmental evaluation approach is applied throughout the mapping process to maximize rapid learning and adaption of a complex challenge when stakeholder engagement and trust building is essential. DISCUSSION Participatory systems mapping shows promise as an adaptive approach to allow public health departments to go beyond the traditional roles of public health practice, to collaborate with nontraditional partners, and implement strategies, initiatives, and/or policies that explicitly address inequity and the social determinants of health. Adaptive strategies provide opportunities for the local public health system to identify community health improvement strategies that align with Public Health 3.0.","output":"Bridging the Gap Between Transformative Practices and Traditional Public Health Approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les manifestations cutanes observes chez les patients COVID-19 sont multiples et frquentes : engelures, exanthme, urticaire, purpura, eczma.

Peritraumatic distress (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of the pandemic is not well known. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients in four groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the ones who were the most at risk. RESULTS: The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (n=1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 (13.71) years and 7.96% (n=141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 (8.14) years. In total, 38.06% (n=674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI 14). An analysis of variance showed that unemployment and depression were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphones or computers for more than 1 hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder.

Slow vital capacity (SVC) was canceled in some countries to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We aimed to test phrenic nerve motor responses as an option to SVC in clinical trials. Methodology: Patients followed-up in our unit were selected respecting inclusion criteria used elsewhere: possible/probable/definite disease; onset-age 18-80years; disease duration from disease duration 24months; body mass index (BMI)>20kg/m2; respiratory subscore of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R)11; upright SVC  70%. We added normal phrenic responses (meanPhrenAmpl, 0.4mV). All patients were on riluzole. SVC and meanPhrenAmpl were recorded at study entry (T0) and 24 weeks later (T1). Decays were determined. Sample size was calculated for a treatment effect of 30% on the decay rate. Results: We included 317 ALS patients (191 males, 225 spinal-onset), mean onset-age 59.9  10.7 (31-80)years, mean onset BMI 25.48  3.2 (20.1-35)kg/m2, mean disease duration 10.5  5.6 (1-24)months, mean ALSFRS-R 41.54  4.3 (22-47) and respiratory subscore 11.83  0.38 (11-12). MeanPhrenAmpl and SVC were weakly but significantly correlated at T0 and T1. At T1, MeanPhrenAmpl decayed 16.94  16.45% and SVC 13.5  16.86%. For the proposed drug effect, 174 and 272 patients would be needed to recruit using respectively meanPhrenAmpl and SVC decline as the primary outcome measurement (accepting no dropouts). Discussion: Contrary to SVC, meanPhrenAmpl is non-volitional and not associated with aerosolization risk. Lower recruitment number (98 patients less) would be needed, translating shorter inclusion period, trial length and costs, and probable lower missed data rate. MeanPhrenAmp is an alternative test in ALS clinical trials.","output":"Phrenic nerve study as outcome in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Evidence-based clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pharmacotherapies are scarce Objective This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment Methods This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020;the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA?)

DESIGN: A scoping review and content analysis of online media reports. SETTING: WHO European region. METHODS: A scoping review of media reports and publications and a search of other grey literature (published from 1 January to 17 September 2020). Primary and secondary outcome measures included measures implemented by governments, public services and non-governmental and civil organisations to prevent or respond to VAWC during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our study found that in 52 of the 53 member states there was at least one measure undertaken to prevent or respond to VAWC during the pandemic. Government-led or government-sponsored measures were the most common, reported in 50 member states. Non-governmental and other civil society-led prevention and response measures were reported in 40 member states. The most common measure was the use of media and social media to raise awareness of VAWC and to provide VAWC services through online platforms, followed by measures taken to expand and/or maintain helpline services for those exposed to violence. CONCLUSION: The potential increase in VAWC during COVID-19-imposed restrictions and lockdowns resulted in adaptations and/or increases in prevention and response strategies in nearly all member states. The strength of existing public health systems influenced the requirement and choice of strategies and highlights the need for sustaining and improving violence prevention and response services. Innovative strategies employed in several member states may offer opportunities for countries to strengthen prevention and responses in the near future and during similar emergencies.","output":"Emerging responses implemented to prevent and respond to violence against women and children in WHO European member states during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review of online media reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop questions for a COVID-19 research agenda from the anthropology of disasters to study the production of pandemic as a feature of the normatively accepted societal state of affairs We encourage an applied study of the pandemic that recognizes it as the product of connections between people, with their social systems, nonhumans, and the material world more broadly, with attention to root causes, (post)colonialism and capitalism, multispecies networks, the politics of knowledge, gifts and mutual aid, and the work of recovery","output":"Entangled Roots and Otherwise Possibilities: An Anthropology of Disasters COVID-19 Research Agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of histopathological analysis of tissue extracted on multitined electrodes and assess whether tissue characteristics can be used as biomarkers of oncologic outcomes after lung tumor radiofrequency (RF) ablation.

Institutional review board waiver was obtained for this study. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue extracted from the electrodes after lung tumor RF ablation was performed for proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (caspase-3). Patient, tumor demographics, and ablation parameters were recorded. Local tumor progression-free survival (LPFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Multivariate analysis determined factors affecting these oncological outcomes. RESULTS A total of 47 lung tumors in 42 patients were ablated; 30 specimens were classified as coagulation necrosis (CN) and 17 as Ki-67-positive (+) tumor cells (viable). Tumor sizes were similar in the CN and Ki-67+ groups (P = 0.32). Median LPFS was 10 versus 16 months for Ki-67+ and CN groups, and 1-year LPFS was 34 and 75 %, respectively (P = 0.003). Median OS was 20 and 46 months (P = 0.12), and median DSS was 20 and 68 months (P = 0.01) for the Ki-67 + and CN groups, respectively. Identification of Ki-67+ tumor cells more than tripled the risk of death from cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.65; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1.34-9.95; P = 0.01] and tripled the risk of local tumor progression (LTP) (HR = 3.01; 95 % CI, 1.39-6.49; P = 0.005).

Despite the high incidence of hernias in Africa and Asia, the implantation of costly mesh netting is not financially feasible. Because of that various investigative groups have examined the use of sterilized mosquito netting. The animal experiments as well as the clinical trials have both shown equivalent short- and long-term results. The goal of this paper is the comparison of biocompatibility of human fibroblasts on the established commercially available nets and on sterilized polyester mosquito mesh over a period of 12 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three commercially available plastic mesh types and a gas-sterilized mosquito polyethylenterephtalate (polyester) mesh were examined. Human fibroblasts from subcutaneous healthy tissue were used. Various tests for evaluating the growth behavior and the cell morphology of human fibroblasts were conducted. The semi-quantitative (light microscopy) and qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) analyses were performed after 1 week and then again after 12 weeks. The cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of the implants were investigated with the help of the 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-cell proliferation test and the LDH-cytotoxicity test. The number of live cells per ml was determined with the Brker counting chamber. In addition, analyses were made of the cell metabolism (oxidative stress) by measuring the pH value, hydrogen peroxide, and glycolysis. RESULTS After 12 weeks, a proliferation of fibroblasts on all mesh is documented. No mesh showed a complete apoptosis of the cells. This qualitative observation could be confirmed quantitatively in a biochemical assay by marking the proliferating cells with BrdU. The biochemical analysis brought the proof that the materials used, including the polyester of the mosquito mesh, are not cytotoxic for the fibroblasts. The vitality of the cells was between 94 and 98%. The glucose metabolism as well as the pH value of the fibroblasts showed no significant differences between the tested meshes. The examination of the oxidative stress via measurement of the H2O2 concentration showed values in the normal range for the commercially alloplastic meshes and the mosquito mesh. CONCLUSIONS Our examination showed no significant difference with regard to biocompatibility between the officially approved and cost-intensive meshes and the sterilized (autoclaved) mosquito mesh. Due to the proven strength and stability of the mosquito mesh and their proven compatibility, the implantation of the sterilized mosquito mesh in additional in vivo studies must be considered. A wide-scale and cost-effective treatment of hernias could thus be guaranteed, not only in Third World countries.","output":"In-vitro examination of the biocompatibility of fibroblast cell lines on alloplastic meshes and sterilized polyester mosquito mesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The viral dynamics and the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are not completely understood. Our aim was to evaluate how RT-PCR Ct values among children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared with that of adult subjects. Methods: Patients (aged from 2 months to []18 years, and adults) with signs and symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for less than 7 days, were prospectively enrolled in the study from May to November 2020. All participants performed RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection; Ct values of ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targets, and the average of all the three probes were used as surrogates of viral load. Results: Of the total of 376 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection there were 21 infants, 62 children and 293 adults. The RT-PCR Ct values of children under 18 were not significantly different from that of adults, as observed by the analyzed probes (namely ORF1ab, N, and S), and by the mean of all 3 gene-targets. However, infants had significantly lower Ct values compared to children and adults (P = 0.044). Discussion: Ct values for children were not significantly different than that of adults with positive SARS-CoV-2.

Thus, the Ministry of Health through the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine, Saudi Arabia, conducted a health risk assessment for the 2017 Camel Festival. This paper summarizes the risk assessment process and highlights the findings and recommendations of the risk assessment. Methods Using an all-hazard approach, the Jeddah tool (derived from the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office's health emergency risk assessment tool) was adapted to conduct the risk assessment. The tool stipulates that risk is directly proportional to the product of hazard magnitude and vulnerability and inversely related to capacity. Results External causes of morbidity and mortality, such as fires and road traffic accidents, were categorized as high risk hazards.

Compared with the international mRNA and adenovirus-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, there is less real-world research data about breakthrough cases in people vaccinated with China-made COVID-19 vaccines. Analyses of clinical outcomes of breakthrough cases will be an important supplement to the clinical trial efficacy and observational effectiveness data of China-made COVID-19 vaccines. WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? COVID-19 vaccine age-eligible individuals (3 years old) who received full primary series and a booster dose of China-made COVID-19 vaccines had good protection from pneumonia caused by Delta variant infection. There was only one serious Delta case in children (unvaccinated), but among adults 18 years and older, there was good protection from serious illness with primary vaccination and booster vaccination. Among people 60 years, full vaccination and booster vaccination were associated with protection from pneumonia and risk of serious COVID-19 caused by Omicron variant infection. There were few serious Omicron cases. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? Everyone 3 years and older without contraindications should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19; schedule-eligible adults should receive booster doses.

METHODS: We sent a survey to physicians worldwide through the network of the World Stroke Organization to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on stroke clinics. To farther along in recovering from the outbreak, we reviewed stroke and other neurology outpatient clinic visits (approximately 50% were stroke related) and the number of inpatient services from December 2019 to July 2020 in a large neurology department in Shanghai, China, where there was no official city lockdown. RESULTS: We received 112 valid survey responses from 46 countries, representing all continents except for Antarctica. Only seven of the survey responders (7/112, 6.3%) reported that they have kept their outpatient clinics open as usual, but they did exercise increased precautions for COVID-19 by following recent guidelines regarding use of personal protective equipment and isolation techniques. The remainder of the respondents have either reduced outpatient clinic services or suspended outpatient clinics completely. Telephone consultation or telemedicine with video capability was used for new patients or follow-ups, with limited in-person evaluations when necessary. Outpatient clinic visits and inpatient services from a large tertiary hospital in China decreased dramatically during the peak period of the outbreak, but then rebounded back quickly following the partial or full recovery from the outbreak. Compared with the recovery process of inpatient services, outpatient clinic visits decreased faster and recovered much slower. This is consistent with our global survey data which indicates that some outpatient clinics have rescheduled their outpatient visits for 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop of in-person outpatient visits and inpatient services.

At the same time lockdowns appeared to be less effective than they were earlier in the pandemic. In this paper we argue that one contributing factor is that existing ways of communicating riskcase numbers, test positivity rates, hospitalisations etc.are difficult for individuals to translate into a level of personal risk, thereby limiting the ability of individuals to properly calibrate their own behaviour. We propose an new more direct measure of personal risk, exposure risk, to estimate the likelihood that an individual will come into contact with an infected person, and we argue that it can play an important role, alongside more conventional statistics, to help translate complex epidemiological data into a simple measure to guide pandemic behaviour. We describe how exposure risk can be calculated using existing data and infection prediction models, and use it to evaluate and compare the exposure risk associated with 39 European countries.","output":"Estimating Exposure Risk to Guide Behaviour During the SARS-COV2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study intends to examine the cause-and-effect relationship between Covid-19 and the factors affecting investment behavior in a South Asian economy.

However, schools' learning modes varied during the 2020-21 school year across states as schools transitioned at differing times back to in-person learning, in part reflecting updated CDC guidance. Reduced access to in-person learning is associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral effects in children (1-3). Data on the learning modes available in 1,200 U.S. public school districts (representing 46% of kindergarten through grade 12 [K-12] public school enrollment) from all 50 states and the District of Columbia during September 2020-April 2021 were matched with National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) demographic data. Learning mode access was assessed for K-12 students during the COVID-19 pandemic, over time and by student race/ethnicity, geography, and grade level group. Across all assessed racial/ethnic groups, prevalence of virtual-only learning showed more variability during September-December 2020 but declined steadily from January to April 2021. During January-April 2021, access to full-time in-person learning for non-Hispanic White students increased by 36.6 percentage points (from 38.0% to 74.6%), compared with 31.1 percentage points for non-Hispanic Black students (from 32.3% to 63.4%), 23.0 percentage points for Hispanic students (from 35.9% to 58.9%) and 30.6 percentage points for students of other races/ethnicities (from 26.3% to 56.9%). In January 2021, 39% of students in grades K-5 had access to full-time in-person learning compared with 33% of students in grades 6-8 and 30% of students in grades 9-12. Disparities in full-time in-person learning by race/ethnicity existed across school levels and by geographic region and state. These disparities underscore the importance of prioritizing equitable access to this learning mode for the 2021-22 school year. To increase equitable access to full-time in-person learning for the 2021-22 school year, school leaders should focus on providing safety-optimized in-person learning options across grade levels.

However, no potent prophylactic therapy is available to control the deadly emerged viral disease. Repurposing of existing antiviral, antiinflammatory, antimalarial drugs is the only option against SARS-CoV-2. But without any clinical evidence, the recommended dose and expected side effects are under debate. As an alternative solution, we proposed a newer hypothesis using the selective, potent anti-HIV drugs and flavonoid class of phytochemicals in combination to balance the potency and toxicity during combat against SARS-CoV-2. Primarily, ten anti-HIV protease inhibitor drugs with ten phyto-flavonoids are selected as ligands for docking study against the putative target, the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6Y2E), as an essential enzyme in viral genome replication. According to molecular docking and drug-ability scores of each ligand, the anti-HIV drug, the darunavir (with a docking score, -10.25 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.60) and the quercetin-3-rhamnoside (with a docking score, -10.90 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.82), were selected for further analysis in the mixture. Later, the interchanged mutual docking analysis suggested that darunavir-quercetin-3- rhamnoside was the most potent and less toxic drug chemical-cocktail/ formulation against SARS-CoV-2-M pro . Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation, predicted toxicity and pharmacokinetics profiles also support to the hypothesized formulation;mainly, eight strong H- bond interactions were found against SARS-CoV-2-M pro . Thus, projected molecular docking- simulation based active and lesser toxic anti-HIV-drug-phyto-flavonoid therapy could be promoted against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Molecular docking-simulation edge assessment of potential and less-toxic anti- HIV-drug and phyto-flavonoid combination against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid, cost-effective identification of genetic variants in small candidate genomic regions remains a challenge, particularly for less well equipped or lower throughput laboratories. The application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer has the potential to fulfil this requirement. We demonstrate a proof of concept for a multiplexing assay that pools PCR amplicons for MinION sequencing to enable sequencing of multiple templates from multiple individuals, which could be applied to gene-targeted diagnostics. A combined strategy of barcoding and sample pooling was developed for simultaneous multiplex MinION sequencing of 100 PCR amplicons. The amplicons are family-specific, spanning a total of 30 loci in DNA isolated from 82 human neurodevelopmental cases and family members. The target regions were chosen for further interrogation because a potentially disease-causative variant had been identified in affected individuals following Illumina exome sequencing. The pooled MinION sequences were deconvoluted by aligning to custom references using the minimap2 aligner software. Our multiplexing approach produced an interpretable and expected sequence from 29 of the 30 targeted genetic loci. The sequence variant which was not correctly resolved in the MinION sequence was adjacent to a five nucleotide homopolymer. It is already known that homopolymers present a resolution problem with the MinION approach. Interestingly despite equimolar quantities of PCR amplicon pooled for sequencing, significant variation in the depth of coverage (127C19,626; mean = 8321, std err = 452.99) was observed. We observed independent relationships between depth of coverage and target length, and depth of coverage and GC content. These relationships demonstrate biases of the MinION sequencer for longer templates and those with lower GC content. We demonstrate an efficient approach for variant discovery or confirmation from short DNA templates using the MinION sequencing device. With less than 130  depth of coverage required for accurate genotyping, the methodology described here allows for rapid highly multiplexed targeted sequencing of large numbers of samples in a minimally equipped laboratory with a potential cost as much 200  less than that from Sanger sequencing.","output":"Proof of concept for multiplex amplicon sequencing for mutation identification using the MinION nanopore sequencer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pfizer vaccine has been approved for use in Saudi Arabia. Although the vaccine efficacy has been frequently addressed, little knowledge is available regarding the real-world post-vaccination menstrual disturbances. Objective: The aim was to evaluate the possible association between Pfizer vaccine and the post-vaccination menstrual irregularities among Saudi citizen and resident women. Subjects and methods: A self-administered validated questionnaire was used to obtain the data. It was distributed all over Riyadh City, KSA through social media and 731 females responded to the survey. Results: Overall, 50.9% of the participants reported a menstrual change after vaccination, in particular, those who received the 2 doses. There was a significant and positive correlation between the number of doses and the experience of menstrual changes being associated with the 2 dosed women. In details, 60.5% mentioned a menstrual delay, 30.4% reported early onset, and 9.1% mentioned a menstrual change other than in the date. 43.3% reported a decrease in the amount of menstrual flow, 34.9 % mentioned an increase. 62.4% declared an increase in the severity of pain while 11% reported a decrease. Interestingly, only 60.8% of the respondents mentioned the persistence of the menstrual changes each following cycle.

Acute UTI constitutes a significant health burden in outpatient pediatrics affecting ~2.8% of children every year. Antibiotics are often started empirically when diagnosing UTI making pediatric UTIs an ideal target for outpatient stewardship. The primary objective was to reduce the use of broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics with a secondary objective to study antibiotic discontinuation in culture negative cases. METHODS: The electronic medical records of two pediatric practices were screened for patients aged 2 months to 18 years diagnosed with uncomplicated UTI using ICD-10 codes N39, R30 and R35. The definition of a positive urine culture was > 50,000 CFU/ml if catheterized and > 100,000 CFU/ml if clean-catch specimen. A two-year pre-intervention period began in January 2018. An audit and review of urine culture processes were studied at each site with a subsequent educational intervention, a direct, one-hour session focused on the use of cephalexin as first-line empiric therapy based on the local antibiogram. The post-intervention period began at each site after the intervention. A COVID-19 sub-analysis was performed for the post-intervention period. RESULTS: During the study, 515 encounters and 113 encounters were included during the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. 74.4% (383/515) of pre-intervention encounters had empirically prescribed antibiotics; higher-generation cephalosporins (i.e. cefdinir, cefprozil) most frequently. Antibiotics were empirically prescribed in 75.2% (85/113) of post-intervention encounters with a statistically significant increase in cephalexin use (32/85, 37.6%, p < 0.01) and reduction in higher-generation cephalosporin use (p < 0.01), Figure 1.

Despite the frequency of laparoscopic appendectomy, consensus does not exist on the best way to perform each procedural step. We identified literature on key intraoperative steps to inform best technical practice during laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods Research questions were framed using the population, indication, comparison, outcome (PICO) format for 6 key operative steps of laparoscopic appendectomy: abdominal entry, placement of laparoscopic ports, division of mesoappendix, division of appendix, removal of appendix, and fascial closure. These questions were used to build literature queries in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases. Evidence quality and certainty was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions. Results Recommendations were rendered for 6 PICO questions based on 28 full length articles. Low quality evidence favors direct trocar insertion for abdominal entry and establishment of pneumoperitoneum. Single port appendectomy results in improved cosmesis with unclear clinical implications. There was insufficient data to determine the optimal method of appendiceal stump closure, but use of a specimen extraction bag reduces rates of superficial surgical site infection and intra-abdominal abscess. Port sites made with radially dilating trocars are less likely to necessitate closure and are less likely to result in port site hernia. When port sites are closed, a closure device should be used.

The inclusion criteria were meeting the CDC criteria for MIS-C. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in all patients by positive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Data were collected from the patients' medical records. Data on the COVID-19 epidemics in Slovenia were collected from National Institute of Public Health. Population data were provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia. Results: Twenty-three patients with MIS-C were diagnosed nationwide in Slovenia, all of them in the second wave of epidemics from 14th September to 31st December 2020. All patients were Caucasian and the estimated prevalence of MIS-C was 5.8/100 000 persons younger than 19 years of age. Detailed analyses were available in 20 patients of which 14 were boys (70 %), median age was 12.4 years (4 months to 17.7 years). Two patients (10 %) were treated in the intensive care unit and none of the patients died. Troponin was elevated in 15/20 (75 %) patients during the disease course, and 7/15 (47 %) of these had normal troponin level at admission. The serum level of troponin closely followed the serum level of CRP. Six out of 20 (30 %) patients had elevated pancreatic enzymes in the second week of the disease after treatment was already given,and one patient developed asymptomatic acute pancreatitis with serum lipase level reaching the maximum of 25kat/L. All patients had elevated levels of D-dimer with no signs of thrombosis. Five patients (5/20;25 %) had pleural effusions and five patients (5/20, 25 %) had ascites. Half of the patients (10/20;50 %) had hepatosplenomegaly and eight (8/20;40 %) had mesenterial lymphadenopathy. Three patients (3/20;15 %) had radiologic signs of cholecystitis. Two patients had thickened lung parenchyma. All patients received IVIG and systemic glucocorticosteroids. Because of resistant or organ threatening disease 4 patients (4/20, 20%) received high dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Biologic therapy with anakinra was started in 2 patients. Nineteen patients (19/20, 95%) received acetylsalicylic acid and prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 15/20 (75%) of patients. The mean follow up was 50 days (14 -122). At the last follow-up visit all patients had normal laboratory parameters of inflammation, troponin, pro-BNP, d-dimer values and normal heart function. Conclusion: A very high incidence of MIS-C, estimated 5.8/100 000 persons under the age of 19 with a predominantly cardiac involvement but very good outcome was noted in European Caucasian population in a nationwide cohort study in Slovenia. Attention to newly described pancreatic involvement should be raised.","output":"A nationwide cohort study on clinical and laboratory manifestations in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.1 At that time, only 118,000 cases had been reported globally, 90% of which had occurred in 4 countries.1 Since then, the world landscape has changed dramatically. As of March 31, 2020, there are now nearly 800,000 cases, with truly global involvement.2 Countries that were previously unaffected are currently experiencing mounting rates of the novel coronavirus infection with associated increases in COVID-19-related deaths. At present, Canada has more than 8000 cases of COVID-19, with considerable variation in rates of infection among provinces and territories.3 Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices. From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements. With strong representation from across the country and the support of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the authors have attempted to provide guidance to their colleagues on the subjects of leadership roles that cardiac surgeons may assume during this pandemic: patient assessment and triage, risk reduction, and real-time sharing of expertise and experiences.","output":"Cardiac Surgery in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Guidance Statement From the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing restrictions, which have been widely carried out as policy choice to curb the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic around the world, we formulate and discuss a staged and weighed networked system based on a classical SEAIR epidemiological model.

Verifying an individual's COVID-19 vaccination would improve cross-border mobility and limit the potential spread of the virus. Recently, the WHO signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Estonia for providing expertise and technical solutions like the interoperable cross-border data exchange ecosystem, X-Road, for piloting a smart vaccine passport trust architecture. Subsequently, the WHO is in the beginning stages of undergoing a process of digital transformation to accommodate the pilot (DT). In this paper, the authors present an exploratory case study using qualitative workshop methods and data triangulation to investigate the technical, political and organizational DT processes occurring in the pilot project. The results suggest the proposed cross-border data exchange trust architecture would exchange non-sensitive personal health information. Some WHO countries are willing to participate and engage in the pilot, but political and legal barriers remain for large-scale implementation. Ultimately, the potential establishment of a trusted global architecture health framework, where not only COVID-19 vaccine data can be exchanged, but new cross-border health services can be created, warrants further investigation. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Challenges and implications of the WHO's digital cross-border COVID-19 vaccine passport recognition pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is critical to understand the factors that could affect the acceptance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in the community. The aim of this study was to determine factors that could possibly affect the acceptance of Indonesian citizens of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: An online survey was conducted between the first and fifth of November, 2020. Participants were asked to respond to questions on acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived religiosity towards, and amount of information about COVID-19. This study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the framework to decide factors that affect vaccine acceptance. Structural Equation Model was employed to assess the correlation between all explanatory variables and vaccine acceptance. Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis rank were employed to assess demographic factors associated with acceptance. Results: In total, 311 responses were included for analysis. Our TAM model suggested that high perceived usefulness significantly increased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and high perceived ease of use significantly increased the perceived usefulness. Perceived religiosity did not substantially affect vaccine acceptance. The amount of information on COVID-19 also did not significantly affect vaccine acceptance. Our data suggested that vaccine acceptance was associated with age, type of occupation, marital status and monthly income to some degree. Conclusion: Since perceived usefulness affects vaccine acceptance, the government should focus on the usefulness of the vaccine when promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to Indonesian citizens. In addition, since perceived ease of use significantly affects users' acceptance to COVID-19 vaccine, the easier to acquire the vaccine in the community, the higher chance that the citizens are willing to be vaccinated.","output":"Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Indonesia: an adoption of Technology Acceptance Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With fast-growing technology, schools have to adapt and use technology constantly as a tool to grow.

To validate the conceptual model, 286 students aged 16C18 years old answered an online questionnaire. The most important drivers that positively affect AA are computer use, employment motivations, and mothers' education.

Animal experiments involving risk grade 3 agents such as SARS CoV, HIV, M.tb, H7N9, and Brucella must be conducted in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) facility. Because of the in vivo work, the biosafety risk in ABSL-3 facilities is higher than that in BSL-3 facilities. Undoubtedly, management practices must be strengthened to ensure biosafety in the ABSL-3 facility. Meanwhile, we cannot ignore the reliable scientific results obtained from animal experiments conducted in ABSL-3 laboratories. It is of great practical significance to study the overall biosafety concepts that can increase the scientific data quality. Based on the management of animal experiments in the ABSL-3 Laboratory of Wuhan University, combined with relevant international and domestic literature, we indicate the main safety issues and factors affecting animal experiment results at ABSL-3 facilities.

Here, we propose such a new mesoscopic model for the dynamics and flow of ferrofluids, where we couple the multi-particle collision dynamics method as a solver for the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations to the stochastic magnetization dynamics of suspended magnetic nanoparticles. This hybrid model is validated by reproducing the magnetoviscous effect in Poiseuille flow, obtaining the rotational viscosity in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We also illustrate the new method for the benchmark problem of flow around a square cylinder. Interestingly, we observe that the length of the recirculation region is increased whereas the drag coefficient is decreased in ferrofluids when an external magnetic field is applied, compared with the field-free case at the same effective Reynolds number. The presence of thermal fluctuations and the flexibility of this particle-based mesoscopic method provides a promising tool to investigate a broad range of flow phenomena of magnetic fluids and could also serve as an efficient way to simulate solvent effects when colloidal particles are immersed in ferrofluids.","output":"Multiparticle Collision Dynamics for Ferrofluids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the Covid-19 pandemic and that patients with CKD are included in a high-risk group, a quick nutrition guide for patients with CKD in all stages was developed, and it is available in Portuguese at https://bit.ly/2zfSjl0, in English at https://bit.ly/covid19ckd, in Spanish at https://bit.ly/guia enfermedad renal and in French at https://bit.ly/covid19maladierenale.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Quick Diet and Nutrition Guide for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has played an increasingly important role in surgical care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet little is known about its usage and correlation to cost both within and across surgical specialties during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: We collected data on telehealth encounters from April 2020 to June 2021 for all surgical specialties at a pediatric academic institution. The percent of total encounters that were telemedicine vs. in-person were analyzed over time. Data on charge and reimbursement were averaged for each encounter type, and the percent difference in average charge and reimbursement was calculated and compared between surgical specialties. RESULTS: Of the 147,007 surgical clinical visits identified, 6,566 encounters (4.5%) were telemedicine. Usage peaked in April and plateaued in June of 2020. The specialties with the highest total percentages of telemedicine visits were neurosurgery (23.2%) and cardiovascular-thoracic (11.9%). Orthopedics reported the lowest usage at 2%. Charges for in-person encounters were higher for nearly all specialties while reimbursements remained equal. CONCLUSION: Our institutional trends reveal that conversion to telemedicine varied across surgical specialty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Charges for in-person encounters were higher than telehealth ones for nearly all specialties, but the reimbursements were fairly the same. Understanding trends in telemedicine volume instigated by and following the pandemic may better prepare pediatric institutions to navigate the accelerated adoption and influence policy changes.

Despite this, few studies have examined parents own perspectives of this experience. The aims of this preliminary study were to (1) identify challenges, benefits, and useful strategies related to remote learning and (2) examine differences in findings across two countries, between parents of youth with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and between parents of children and adolescents. To address these aims, parent responses to open-ended questions on the Home Adjustment to COVID-19 Scale (HACS;Becker et al., 2020) were examined across three studies conducted in the United States and Australia (N=606, children: 68.5% male, ages 6-17 years). The challenges most frequently expressed by parents included the childs difficulty staying on task (20.5%), lack of motivation (15.3%), remote learning factors (13.4%), and lack of social interaction (10.9%). The most frequently expressed strategy related to using routines and schedules (51.4%) and the biggest benefit was more family time (18.3%). Findings were largely consistent across countries, ADHD status, and age, suggesting that many parental responses to remote learning appear to be universal. Given that the most common challenges were child- (e.g., difficulties with staying on task and motivation), parent- (e.g., balancing remote learning with work responsibilities), and school- (e.g., limited direct contact with teachers) related, there is a need for improved support across these systems going forward.","output":"A Preliminary Examination of Key Strategies, Challenges, and Benefits of Remote Learning Expressed by Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the perception and concerns of people about COVID-19 vaccine in developing and populous country like India will help in understanding demand for the vaccine and further tailoring out public health information and education activities.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as New York City (NYC) emerged as the US epicenter, hospitals saw a marked reduction in patients presenting with non-COVID-related diseases. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of the pandemic on the incidence, presentation, and management of AA. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with AA who presented to two academic medical centers during the NYC COVID peak (March 22nd-May 31st, 2020) was performed. This group was compared to a control cohort presenting during the same period in 2019. Primary outcomes included the incidence of AA, complicated disease, and management. Secondary outcomes included duration of symptoms, hospital length of stay, and complication rates. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, and Fishers exact tests. RESULTS: A 49.1% reduction in the incidence of AA was seen between 2019 (n = 114) and 2020 (n = 58). Median duration of symptoms doubled from 1 day in 2019 to 2 days in 2020 (P < .02). Proportionally, the incidence of complicated appendicitis rose from 19.3% to 41.4% (P < .005). 32.4% of patients with uncomplicated AA underwent non-operative management in 2020, compared to 12% in 2019 (P < .02). Hospital length of stay and complication rates were similar between years. DISCUSSION: Significantly fewer AA patients presented during the initial phase of the pandemic. Patients presented later, which may have contributed to a higher proportion of complicated disease. Surgeons were also more likely to treat uncomplicated AA nonoperatively than they were prior.

It is common in the intensive care unit and is associated with poorer outcomes. Good quality sleep is important in the prevention and management of delirium. Melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the pineal gland which helps in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. It is possible that melatonin supplementation in intensive care improves sleep and prevents delirium. METHODS AND DESIGN: The Prophylactic Melatonin for Delirium in Intensive Care study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether melatonin given prophylactically decreases delirium in critically ill patients. A total of 850 ICU patients have been randomised (1:1) to receive either melatonin or a placebo. Participants were monitored twice daily for symptoms of delirium. RESULTS: This paper and the attached additional files describe the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the trial. The SAP has been developed and submitted for publication before the database has been locked and before the treatment allocation has been unblinded. The SAP contains details of analyses to be undertaken, which will be reported in the primary and secondary publications.

Many drug molecules can bind to plasma proteins to different extents in vivo, whereas only the free drug can reach the site of action to exert a pharmacological effect and cause toxicity. However, free MTX concentrations in plasma have not been reported. Traditional analyses of free drugs are both cumbersome and inaccurate. We collected 92 plasma samples from 52 children diagnosed with ALL or NHL or other lymphomas that were treated with HD-MTX. The hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration (HFCF-UF) was used to prepare plasma samples for analysis of the free MTX concentration. Protein precipitation was employed to measure the total MTX concentration. The HFCF-UF is a simple method involving a step of ordinary centrifugation; the validation parameters for the methodological results were satisfactory and fell within the acceptance criteria. A linearity coefficient r (2) of 0.910 was obtained for the correlation between the free and total MTX plasma concentrations in 92 plasma samples. However, the free and total MTX concentrations was only weakly correlated in 16 clinical plasma specimens with total MTX concentrations >2 mol L(?1) (r (2) = 0.760). Both the free and total MTX concentrations at 42 h were negatively correlated with the creatinine clearance (CCr) level (P = 0.023, r = ?0.236 for total MTX and P = 0.020, r = ?0.241for free MTX, respectively). The free MTX concentration could not be accurately estimated from the total MTX concentration for patients with high MTX levels which are conditions under which toxic reactions are more likely to occur. High plasma MTX levels could become a predictor of the occurrence of MTX nephrotoxicity to draw people's attention.

METHODS: Volunteers over 18 years of both sexes, members of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil answered instruments related to perceived stress, depression, resilience and coping strategies during final exams at the end of semester during 2018 to 2020. RESULTS: We obtained 1,135 responses (893 before COVID-19 and 242 during COVID-19). The volunteers did not show significant differences for perceived stress, depressive signs and resilience before and during the pandemic. In both periods, men exhibited lower scores for perceived stress and depression and higher scores for resilience when compared to women. Undergraduate and graduate students exhibited higher perceived stress scores, more pronounced depressive signs and lower resilience, and employees and professors presented lower scores for perceived stress, depressive signs and greater resilience. CONCLUSIONS: These first months of confinement did not directly affect the scores of perceived stress, depression and resilience, however, each subgroup adapted to the new routine by changing the coping strategy used.

Many viruses use deubiquitinases and deISGylases that reverse these modifications and antagonize host signaling processes. We here reveal that the leader protease, Lb(pro), from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) targets ISG15 and to a lesser extent, ubiquitin in an unprecedented manner. Unlike canonical deISGylases that hydrolyze the isopeptide linkage after the C-terminal GlyGly motif, Lb(pro) cleaves the peptide bond preceding the GlyGly motif. Consequently, the GlyGly dipeptide remains attached to the substrate Lys, and cleaved ISG15 is rendered incompetent for reconjugation. A crystal structure of Lb(pro) bound to an engineered ISG15 suicide probe revealed the molecular basis for ISG15 proteolysis. Importantly, anti-GlyGly antibodies, developed for ubiquitin proteomics, are able to detect Lb(pro) cleavage products during viral infection.

A propensity score-matching (PSM) method (1:1 matching including patients' characteristics, medical history, vital statistics and laboratory results) was used to compare patients with and without diabetes (n = 603 per group). The primary outcome was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or in-hospital death. RESULTS: After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between those with and without diabetes: mean age was 71.2 years; 61.8% were male; and mean BMI was 29 kg/m2. A history of cardiovascular, chronic kidney and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases were found in 32.8%, 22.1% and 6.4% of participants, respectively.

METHODS AND RESULTS: All major cardiac procedures (n = 374,899) performed between 1(st) January and 31(st) May for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 were analysed, stratified by procedure type and time-period (pre-COVID: January-May 2018 and 2019 and January-February 2020 and COVID: March-May 2020). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality for procedures performed in the COVID period. Overall, there was a deficit of 45,501 procedures during the COVID period compared to the monthly averages (March-May) in 2018-2019. Cardiac catheterisation and device implantations were the most affected in terms of numbers (n = 19,637 and n = 10,453) whereas surgical procedures such as MVR, other valve replacement/repair, ASD/VSD repair and CABG were the most affected as a relative percentage difference () to previous years averages.

A critical question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active-site cavity are; resolving this point would help understand the catalytic details of the enzyme and inform rational drug development against this pernicious virus. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro, which allowed direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states in the protease. We observe that the catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive form in which Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state and His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, instead of the neutral unreactive state usually envisaged. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states, and thus electrical charges, of all other amino acid residues and revealed intricate hydrogen-bonding networks in the active-site cavity and at the dimer interface. The fine atomic details present in this structure were made possible by the unique scattering properties of the neutron, which is an ideal probe for locating hydrogen positions and experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature. Our observations provide critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to the enzyme's electrostatic environment.","output":"Unusual zwitterionic catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease revealed by neutron crystallography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A substantial reduction in global transport and industrial processes stemming from the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and subsequent pandemic resulted in sharp declines in emissions, including for NO2.

To explore how much COVID-19 shutdown policies impacted urban air quality, we examined ground-based NO2 sensor data from 11 U.S. cities from a two-month window (MarchCApril) during shutdown in 2020, controlling for natural seasonal variability by using average changes in NO2 over the previous five years for these cities. Levels of NO2 and VMT reduction in March and April compared to January 2020 ranged between 11C65% and 11C89%, consistent with a sharp drop in vehicular traffic from shutdown-related travel restrictions. To explore this link closely, we gathered detailed traffic count data in one cityIndianapolis, Indianaand found a strong correlation (0.90) between traffic counts/classification and vehicle miles travelled, a moderate correlation (0.54) between NO2 and traffic related data, and an average reduction of 1.11 ppb of NO2 linked to vehicular data.

So far, only soluble, single domain ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, and these have been implicated in reproduction in insects. Furthermore, an ACE-related carboxypeptidase was recently characterized in Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote, suggesting the existence of ACE in more distant organisms. Interestingly, in silico databank analysis revealed that bacterial DNA sequences could encode putative ACE-like proteins, strikingly similar to vertebrates' enzymes. To gain more insight into the bacterial enzymes, we cloned the putative ACE from the phytopathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, named XcACE. The 2 kb open reading frame encodes a 672-amino-acid soluble protein containing a single active site. In vitro expression and biochemical characterization revealed that XcACE is a functional 72 kDa dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase. As in mammals, this metalloprotease hydrolyses angiotensin I into angiotensin II. XcACE is sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ions concentration. Variations in the active site residues, highlighted by structural modelling, can account for the different substrate selectivity and inhibition profile compared to human ACE.

The main routes of transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to current evidence, are via droplets inhalation, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, and transmission via the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes, and probably through airborne particles from the respiratory tract, generated during coughing and sneezing of infected individuals. During the pulmonary function testing (PFTs), which require strenuous breathing maneuvers and generate high-intensity airflow, aerosols, and micro-aerosols are formed from respiratory secretions and may contain viral and bacterial particles. Therefore, such forced respiratory maneuvers pose a significant risk of spreading the infection to patients and laboratory staff.

Addiction consultation services (ACS) increasingly provide OUD treatment to hospitalized patients, but barriers to initiating and continuing medications for OUD remain. We examined facilitators and barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers in the context of an ACS. METHODS: In this qualitative study, we sought input using key informant interviews and focus groups from patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization and from hospitalists, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses who work in the hospital setting. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed transcripts using a directed content analysis. FINDINGS: We conducted 20 key informant interviews with patients, nine of whom were interviewed following hospital discharge and 12 of whom were interviewed during a rehospitalization. We completed six focus groups and eight key informant interviews with hospitalists and hospital-based medical staff (n = 62). Emergent themes related to hospital-based OUD treatment included the following: the benefit of an ACS to facilitate OUD treatment engagement; expanded use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid withdrawal; the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and easily accessible, patient-centered treatment motivates change in opioid use; adequate pain control and stabilization of mental health conditions among patients with OUD contributed to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) continuation; and stable housing and social support are prerequisites for OAT uptake and continuation. CONCLUSION: Modifiable factors which facilitate hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation include availability of in-hospital addiction expertise to offer easily accessible, patient-centered treatment and the use of methadone or buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal.

This study aims to project the ability to reach the target in Hunan Province, China, and establish the priority for future interventions. METHODS: We conducted the study during 2019C2020. From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, we extracted death data for Hunan during 1990C2016 for four main NCDs, namely cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. We generated estimates for 2025 by fitting a linear regression to the premature mortality over the most recent trend identified by a joinpoint regression model. We also estimated excess premature mortality attributable to unfavorable changes over time. RESULTS: The rate of premature mortality from all NCDs in Hunan will be 19.5% (95% CI [19.0%C20.1%]) by 2025, with the main contributions being from CVD (8.2%, 95% CI [7.9%C8.5%]) and cancer (7.9%, 95% CI [7.8%C8.1%]). Overall, it will be impossible to achieve the target, with a relative reduction of 16.4%. Women may be able to meet the target except with respect to cancer, and men will not except with respect to chronic respiratory diseases. Most of the unfavorable changes have occurred since 2008C2009. DISCUSSION: More urgent efforts, especially for men, should be exerted in Hunan by integrating population-wide interventions into a stronger health-care system. In the post lock-down COVID-19 era in China, reducing the NCD risk factors can also lower the risk of death from COVID-19.","output":"Projection of premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases for 2025: a model based study from Hunan Province, China, 1990C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The debate over how firm stakeholder engagement is tied to preserving shareholder wealth has received growing attention in recent years, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. Against this backdrop, we examine the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and stock market returns during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market crash and the post-crash recovery. Using a sample of 1,750 U.S. firms and two major sources of CSR ratings, we find no evidence that CSR affected stock returns during the crash period. This result is robust to various sensitivity tests. In additional cross-sectional analysis, we find some supporting evidence, albeit weak, that the relation between CSR and stock returns during the pandemic-related crisis is more positive when CSR is congruent with a firms institutional environment. We also find that Business Roundtable companies, which committed to protecting stakeholder interests prior to the pandemic, do not outperform during the pandemic crisis. We conclude that pre-crisis CSR is not effective at shielding shareholder wealth from the adverse effects of a crisis, suggesting a potential disconnect between firms CSR orientation (ratings) and actual actions. Our evidence suggests that investors can distinguish between genuine CSR and firms engaging in cheap talk.","output":"Does CSR Matter in Times of Crisis?

Objective To identify the optimal triage and transport strategy: direct to the endovascular center (mothership) or immediate alteplase treatment followed by transfer to the endovascular center (drip and ship), for all patients with suspected large-vessel occlusion stroke. Design Setting, and Participants This was a theoretical, conditional probability modeling study. Existing data from clinical trials of stroke treatment were used for model generation. The study was conducted from February 1, 2017, to March 1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The time-dependent efficacy of alteplase and endovascular therapy and the accuracy of large-vessel occlusion screening tools were modeled to estimate the probability of positive outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-1 at 90 days) for both the drip-and-ship and mothership transport strategies. Based from onset to treatment, the strategy that estimates the greatest probability of excellent outcome is determined in several different scenarios. Results The patient's travel time from both thrombolysis and endovascular therapy centers, speed of treatment, and positive predictive value of the screening tool affect whether the drip-and-ship or mothership strategy estimates best outcomes. With optimal treatment times (door-to-needle time: 30 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 50 minutes; door-to-groin-puncture time: 60 minutes [mothership], 30 minutes [drip and ship]), both options estimate similar outcomes when the centers are 60 minutes or less apart. However, with increasing travel time between the 2 centers (90 or 120 minutes), drip and ship is favored if the patient would have to travel past the thrombolysis center to reach the endovascular therapy center or if the patient would arrive outside the alteplase treatment time window in the mothership scenario. Holding other variables constant, if treatment times are slow at the thrombolysis center (door-to-needle time: 60 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 120 minutes), the area where mothership estimates the best outcomes expands, especially when the 2 centers are close together (60 minutes apart or less). The area where mothership estimates the best outcome also expands as the positive predictive value of the screening tool increases. Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that decision making for prehospital transport can be modeled using existing clinical trial data and that these models can be dynamically adapted to changing realities. Based on current median treatment times to realize the full benefit of endovascular therapy on a population level, the study findings suggest that delivery of the treatment should be regionally centralized. The study modeling suggests that transport decision making is context specific and the radius of superiority of the transport strategy changes based on treatment times at both centers, transport times, and the triaging tool used.","output":"Modeling Stroke Patient Transport for All Patients With Suspected Large-Vessel Occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gamiikation has spread into almost all scientific fields as a way to achieve beneficial outcomes such as productivity, engagement, learning and health. However, gamification has been less applied into enhancing scientific process and science communication themselves. As a case in point, in this paper we demonstrate how an international gamification conference was gamified through Etsija's Call, a mysterious Alternate Reality Conference Game, to enhance conference engagement, create a positive mood for livelier communication and networking as well as to build a communal spirit among participants. The international GamiFIN conference 2020 was held online due to COVID-19. Therefore, the present paper also contributes to the growing literature on remote work and online research and dissemination practices. In this research effort, we employ both design science and mixed-method empirical work (N=47). First, we outline the process and materials involved in the ideation, design and implementation of the game, secondly, we outline the thematic analysis (n=17) of materials gathered throughout the conference from interaction with the game, and thirdly, we report preliminary results of the adapted Gameful Experience Questionnaire (GAMEFULQUEST) based on the participants' experience (n=6) and the game's probable influence on the conference experience (n=13). Our preliminary analyses show that conference participants had a meaningful interaction with the game which further enabled them to engage with several conference facets, situations and participants as indicated by the qualitative analysis of participants' interactions with the game. Moreover, the preliminary quantitative analyses based on the responses on the GAMEFULQUEST indicate that respondents had had a positive gameful experience as a consequence of interacting with Etsija's Call While the present study was preliminary and a first pilot of the conference game, future research on Etsija's Call and other similar implementations should attempt to increase the volume of the investigation in terms of participants.

It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION: An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION: Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events. New management and treatment strategies will need to be discussed and implemented considering the changing landscape around the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Immune-checkpoint inhibitor toxicity during a pandemic: Overcoming patient fears to provide care.

METHODS: In the Netherlands, women aged 30C60 years invited for cervical screening can choose between sampling at the clinician's office (Cervex Brush) or self-sampling at home (Evalyn Brush). HrHPV testing is performed using Roche Cobas 4800. We collected screening test results between January 2017 and March 2018 and histological follow-up until August 2019. The main outcome measures were mean cycle threshold (Ct) value, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or cancer (CIN3+) and CIN grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). FINDINGS: 30,808 women had a self-collected and 456,207 had a clinician-collected sample. In hrHPV-positive women with adequate cytology, Ct values were higher for self-collection than clinician-collection with a mean Ct difference of 125 (95% CI 098C152) in women without CIN2+, 273 (175C372) in CIN2 and 359 (303C415) in CIN3+. The relative sensitivity for detecting CIN3+ was 094 (090C097) for self-collection versus clinician-collection and the relative specificity was 102 (102C102). INTERPRETATION: The clinical accuracy of hrHPV testing on a self-collected sample for detection of CIN3+ is high and supports its use as a primary screening test for all invited women. Because of the slightly lower sensitivity of hrHPV testing on a self-collected compared to a clinician-collected sample, an evaluation of the workflow procedure to optimise clinical performance seems warranted.

The traditional conclusion is: the higher the stock liquidity, the weaker the enterprise's sustainable innovation level, especially in state-owned enterprises. The DID estimation using the share-trading reform and the policy of large and small-sized non-tradable share shows that: stock liquidity will affect the sustainable innovation level of the enterprise positively. The reasons for this mechanism are the supervision mechanism in the operation of the enterprise, the effect of the balance of the ownership structure and the improvement of corporate governance.

Serum SDC-1 was collected on admission prior to treatment. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients fully met the IgAV diagnostic criteria at admission (IgAV group), 20 patients with rash only and diagnosed IgAV during hospitalization (Purpura group). In IgAV group, 30 patients with gastrointestinal involvements (IgAV-GI group) and 18 patients without gastrointestinal involvements (IgAV-NGI group).

User needs and technical requirements were identified in end user interviews and then synthesized. Several representations were then developed (according to good visualization practice) and submitted to end users for appraisal. Lastly, dashboards were implemented and made accessible for everyday use via the medical center's network. After a period of use, end user feedback on the dashboard platform was collected as a system usability score (range 0 to 100). Seventeen themes (corresponding to 29 questions and 42 indicators) were identified. After prioritization and feasibility assessment, 10 dashboards were ultimately implemented and deployed.

Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) is an ideal model for studying the interaction between avian viruses and their hosts. To establish a methodological platform for RNAi studies in CEF, three plasmid vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted against the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) NP gene were constructed. One of them, ndv1, was proven effective on blocking viral replication in CEF and chicken embryos. Four hours prior to infection with NDV, the CEF was transfected with the plasmids by Silent-fect.

The expression of a potent shRNA resulted in up to 2.3, 21.1 and 9.8 fold decreases in NP gene expression at 3, 6 and 9 h post infection in CEF, respectively. The ndv1 was able to completely inhibit the replication of the virus in CEF within 48 post infection. Furthermore, the pathological changes in CEF caused by NDV were delayed, and the degree of pathological changes was lighter compared with the mock transfection in the presence of ndv1.

In addition, donation rates for DCDs are typically lower than for DBDs. Although there has been a great deal of research on how the concerns of DBD families impact donation, limited research exists on family concerns and decision-making in the DCD request process. OBJECTIVE To determine the concerns of families approached for DCD and explore how those might be addressed to increase DCD donation rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Written request response forms were completed by organ procurement and family services coordinators from 4 organ procurement organizations in 4 different states. They were filled out as soon as possible after speaking with families about DCD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses were marked on a 12-item instrument, and anecdotal observations and detailed comments about family concerns, donor registration status, and decisions made were noted. RESULTS Family concerns that block DCDs differ in many ways from those that block DBDs. These concerns arise from stresses peculiar to the DCD situation and must be addressed for these types of donations to increase. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purposes of the study are to identify family concerns about donating organs that are specific to DCD and that may differ from DBD and to distinguish how those concerns might be addressed in ways that increase the likelihood of donation.","output":"A Study of Concerns of Families of Potential Donation After Circulatory Death Donors and Recommendations for Raising Donation Rates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since May 2019, U.S.-Iran tensions have heightened significantly, and evolved into conflict after U.S. military forces killed Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and one of Iran's most important military commanders, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on January 3, 2020. The United States and Iran have appeared to be on the brink of additional hostilities since, as attacks by Iran-backed groups on bases in Iraq inhabited by U.S. forces have continued. The background to the U.S.-Iran tensions are the 2018 Trump Administration withdrawal from the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA), and Iran's responses to the U.S. policy of applying \\"maximum pressure\\" on Iran. Since mid- 2019, Iran and Iran-linked forces have attacked and seized commercial ships, destroyed some critical infrastructure in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, conducted rocket and missile attacks on facilities used by U.S. military personnel in Iraq, downed a U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle, and harassed U.S. warships in the Gulf. As part of an effort it terms \\"maximum resistance,\\" Iran has also reduced its compliance with the provisions of the JCPOA. The Administration has deployed additional military assets to the region to try to deter future Iranian actions. The U.S.-Iran tensions still have the potential to escalate into all-out conflict. Iran's materiel support for armed factions throughout the region, including its provision of short-range ballistic missiles to these factions, and Iran's network of agents in Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere, give Iran the potential to expand confrontation into areas where U.S. response options might be limited. Iran has continued all its operations in the region despite wrestling with the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected Iran significantly. United States military has the capability to undertake a range of options against Iran, both against Iran directly and against its regional allies and proxies. A September 14, 2019, attack on critical energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia demonstrated that Iran and/or its allies have the capability to cause significant damage to U.S. allies and to U.S. regional and global economic and strategic interests, and raised questions about the effectiveness of U.S. defense relations with the Gulf states. Despite the tensions and some hostilities with Iran since 2020 began, President Donald Trump continued to state that his policy goal is to negotiate a revised JCPOA that encompasses not only nuclear issues but also Iran's ballistic missile program and Iran's support for regional armed factions. High-ranking officials from several countries have sought to mediate to try to de-escalate U.S.-Iran tensions by encouraging direct talks between Iranian and U.S. leaders. President Trump has stated that he welcomes talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions, but Iran insists that the United States lift sanctions as a precondition for talks, and no U.S.-Iran talks have been known to take place to date. Members of Congress have received additional information from the Administration about the causes of the U.S.-Iran tensions and Administration responses. They have responded in a number of ways;some Members have sought to pass legislation requiring congressional approval for any decision by the President to take military action against Iran. ? 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","output":"U.S.-Iran conflict and implications for U.S. policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil and gas fields are a critical part of our infrastructure, and vulnerable to attack by powerful adversaries.

A patient survey was performed to determine perspectives on this important clinical challenge. METHODS: Patients with EBC experiencing VMS participated in an anonymous survey. Patients reported on the frequency and severity of VMS using the validated Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS) and ranked their most bothersome symptoms. Respondents were also asked to determine endpoints that defined effective treatment of VMS and report on the effectiveness of previously tried interventions. RESULTS: Responses were received from 373 patients, median age 56 years (range 23C83), who experienced an average of 5.0 hot flashes per day (SD 6.57). Patients reported the most bothersome symptoms to be feeling hot/sweating (155/316, 49%) and sleeping difficulties (86/316, 27%). Fifty-five percent (201/365) of patients would consider a treatment to be effective if it reduced night-time awakenings. While 68% of respondents were interested in trying interventions from their healthcare team to manage VMS, only 18% actually did so. Of the 137 patients who had tried an intervention for VMS, pharmacological treatments, exercise, and relaxation strategies were more likely to be effective, while therapies such as melatonin and black cohosh were deemed less effective. CONCLUSION: VMS are a common and bothersome problem for EBC patients, with a minority receiving interventions to manage these symptoms.

We explored the impact of the national stay-at-home orders on alcohol or drug use and screenings among trauma admissions. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at six Level I trauma centers across four states. Patients admitted during the period after the onset of the COVID-19 restrictions (defined as March 16, 2020-May 31, 2020) were compared with those admitted during the same time period in 2019. We compared 1) rate of urine drug screens and blood alcohol screens; 2) rate of positivity for drugs or alcohol (blood alcohol concentration  10 mg/dL); 3) characteristics of patients who were positive for drug or alcohol, by period using chi-squared tests or Fishers exact tests, as appropriate. Two-tailed tests with an alpha of p < 0.05 was used on all tests. RESULTS: There were 4762 trauma admissions across the study period; 2602 (55%) in 2019 and 2160 (45%) in 2020. From 2019 to 2020, there were statistically significant increases in alcohol screens (34% vs. 37%, p = 0.03) and drug screens (21% vs. 26%, p < 0.001). Overall, the rate of alcohol positive patients significantly increased from 2019 to 2020 (32% vs. 39%, p = 0.007), while the rate of drug positive patients was unchanged (57% vs. 52%, p = 0.13). Of the 1025 (22%) patients who were positive for alcohol or drugs, there were significant increases in a history of alcoholism (41% vs. 26%, p < 0.001), and substance abuse (11% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) in the 2020 period. No other statistically significant differences were identified among alcohol or drug positive patients during COVID-19 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our first wave of COVID-19 data suggests that trauma centers were admitting significantly more patients who were alcohol positive, as well those with substance use disorders, potentially due to the impact of social restrictions and guidelines.

Avoidance of laparoscopy was recommended, to reduce aerosol generation and risk of virus transmission. Evidence on the safety profile of laparoscopy during the pandemic is lacking. This study compares patient outcomes and risk to staff from laparoscopic and open gastrointestinal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Single-centre retrospective study of gastrointestinal operations performed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, comorbidity, perioperative and survival data were collected from electronic medical records and supplemented with patient symptoms reported at telephone follow up. Outcomes assessed were: patient mortality, illness among staff, patient COVID-19 rates, length of hospital stay and postdischarge symptomatology. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients with median age of 56 years were included; 55 (75%) and 18 (25%) underwent laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively. All-cause mortality was 5% (4/73), was related to COVID-19 in all cases, with no mortality after laparoscopic surgery. A total of 14 staff members developed COVID-19 symptoms within 2 weeks, with no significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery (10 vs 4; p=0.331).

Smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections; thus, cessation represents a huge opportunity for public health. However, there is scarce evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed an observational case-control study, assessing the single-day point prevalence of smoking among 218 COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in 7 Italian non-intensive care wards and in a control group of 243 patients admitted for other conditions to 7 general wards COVID-19-free. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the &#967;2 test and performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the variables associated with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: The percentages of current smokers (4.1% vs 16%, p=0.00003) and never smokers (71.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.0014) were significantly different between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower mean age (69.5 vs 74.2 years, p=0.00085) and were more frequently males (59.2% vs 44%, p=0.0011). In the logistic regression analysis, current smokers were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (Odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.48, p<0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.31, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. The meaning of these preliminary findings, which are in line with those currently emerging in literature, is unclear; they need to be confirmed by larger studies. IMPLICATIONS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in some Italian non-intensive care wards is reported.

Based on toll of the cases and number of deaths, this public health threat turned out to be a catastrophe beyond the controlling authority and capacity of the health system, and hence other sectors and agencies had to be engaged for devising a concerted and integrated response to deal with the emergency. Governance was disorderly, financing was inadequate, human resources were not trained, supplies and logistic were not stocked, information system was patchy, and research capacity was limited, and most of all the service delivery was in a biggest chaos of times. COVID-19 demanded to re-configure the health system of Pakistan. CONCLUSION: Improving the emergency preparedness of the hospitals is the foremost and an urgent need. A strong national public health system in Pakistan is needed to rapidly investigate and analyze the reports, assess the magnitude of the public health risk, share real-time information, and implement public health control measures in a concerted and systematic demeanor.","output":"Strengthening health system building blocks: configuring post-COVID-19 scenario in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immediately before the pandemic, 300 enterprise Mayo Clinic physicians and advanced practice providers had performed a minimum of one video telemedicine consult in the preceding year.

OBJECTIVE: The present narrative review aims to compile and synthesize the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHOD: This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. RESULTS: 73 publications were included for full-text reading and were classified into the following categories: levels of social isolation, economic effects, family relationships, health system, mental health of the population, and use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to plan an escalation of responses to the consequences of the pandemic, especially in view of the increased demand on the health sector and social services. The negative effects of social isolation can be prevented by public policies that offer a response to the economic recession, maintenance of social work, encouragement of quality care in mental health services, and community support for vulnerable families.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing: economic, psychological, family, and technological effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differential characteristics of SARS-COV-2 associated inflammatory multisystem syndrome (MIS-C) in children.

This review summarizes current knowledge about ACE2 as a multifunctional protein, focusing on its relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As an enzyme, ACE2 may be protective in IBD because it favors the counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system or deleterious because it metabolizes other anti-inflammatory/repairing elements. Meanwhile, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the impact of ACE2 expression/activity on infection is still under debate because no direct evidence has been reported and, again, both protective and deleterious pathways are possible. Research has shown that ACE2 regulates the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT1, controlling tryptophan-associated intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. Finally, intact membrane-bound or shed soluble ACE2 can also trigger integrin signaling, modulating the response to anti-integrin biologic drugs used to treat IBD (such as vedolizumab) and fibrosis, a long-term complication of IBD. As such, future studies on ACE2 expression/activity in IBD can improve monitoring of the disease and explore an alternative pharmacological target.","output":"Unraveling the Role of ACE2, the Binding Receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey was to understand the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has or has had on the work, training, and wellbeing of professionals in the field of diagnostic neuroradiology.

The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home.

In this exploratory, proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of FMT in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial, we randomly allocated (1:1) adults with active peripheral PsA (3 swollen joints) despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate to one gastroscopic-guided FMT or sham transplantation into the duodenum. Safety was monitored throughout the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing treatment failure (ie, needing treatment intensification) through 26 weeks. Key secondary endpoints were change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response at week 26. RESULTS: Of 97 screened, 31 (32%) underwent randomisation (15 allocated to FMT) and 30 (97%) completed the 26-week clinical evaluation. No serious adverse events were observed. Treatment failure occurred more frequently in the FMT group than in the sham group (9 (60%) vs 3 (19%); risk ratio, 3.20; 95% CI 1.06 to 9.62; p=0.018).

Objectives: To determine whether steroid-na?ve children are at higher risk of PICU admission among those hospitalised for SAA. Furthermore, we included the secondary risk factors tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitisation, previous admissions and viral infections. Methods: A prospective, nationwide multicentre study of children with SAA (2-18a? years) admitted to all Dutch PICUs and four general wards between 2016 and 2018. Potential risk factors for PICU admission were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Measurements and main results: 110 PICU and 111 general ward patients were included. The proportion of steroid-na?ve children did not differ significantly between PICU and ward patients. PICU children were significantly older and more exposed to tobacco smoke, with symptoms >1a? week prior to admission. Viral susceptibility was not a significant risk factor for PICU admission. Conclusions: Children with SAA admitted to a PICU were comparable to those admitted to a general ward with respect to ICS treatment prior to admission.

In a retrospective observational study, we determined vascular and functional effects of a 6-month structured pain-free exercise program in patients with claudication and compressible vessels. Four-hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients were studied. Segmental limb pressures were measured and ABI calculated during circa-monthly hospital visits. The 6-min (6MWD) and the pain-free walking distance (PFWD) during the 6-min walking test were determined. Two daily 8-min sessions of slowCmoderate in-home walking at increasing metronome-paced speed were prescribed. After excluding patients with unmeasurable ABI or incompletion of the program, 239 patients were studied. Safe and satisfactory (88%) execution of the prescribed training sessions was reported. During the visits, bilateral ABI improved (+ 0.07; p < 0.001) as well as the segmental pressures in the more impaired limb, with changes already significant after 5 weeks of slow walking.

Neutrophils play an essential role in immune defense against foreign agents and also participate in the development of inflammatory responses. However, the role of these cells in the PM(10) induced inflammatory response is not yet fully established. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of PM(10) on the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response. For this, neutrophils from healthy adult human donors were in vitro exposed to different concentrations of PM(10). The cell viability and cytotoxic activity were evaluated by MTT. LDH, propidium iodide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified by flow cytometry. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) expression, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD(4)), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and neutrophil elastase (NE) expression were measured by RT-PCR. IL-8 was also quantified by ELISA. Fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release. The in vivo inflammatory responses were assessed in BALB/c mice exposed to PM(10) by histopathology and RT-PCR. The analysis shows that PM(10) exposure induced a cytotoxic effect on neutrophils, evidenced by necrosis and LDH release at high PM(10) concentrations.

However, it is still an open question to what extent as well as which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based medical image classification pipelines. In this work, we proposed a reproducible medical image classification pipeline for analyzing the performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques: Augmenting, Stacking, and Bagging. The pipeline consists of state-of-the-art preprocessing and image augmentation methods as well as 9 deep convolution neural network architectures. It was applied on four popular medical imaging datasets with varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling functions for combining multiple predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical functions like unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model based pipelines. Cross-validation based Bagging demonstrated significant performance gain close to Stacking, which resulted in an F1-score increase up to +11%.

Results showed that the marginal utility of health welfare was lower than that of high-level traceability information and similar to that of place of origin but was higher than that of middle-level traceability information. A complementary relationship existed between dietary animal welfare and high-level traceability information and between health welfare and non-indigenous production. A substitution relationship existed between health welfare and indigenous production and between environmental animal welfare and non-indigenous production. The marginal utilities of health welfare and dietary welfare were higher than those of all price levels, and consumers accept a higher price as a result of increased production costs due to the inclusion of animal welfare information.

Abstract A critical review of articles on respiratory infections published in the last three months of 2008 to the end of 2009. There are articles on patients with bronchiectasis that study their quality of life, as well as those that analyse the decrease in the number of exacerbations due to the immunomodulatory effect of using low doses of macrolides in these patients. In the diagnosis of tuberculosis, works on the application of interferon- are especially relevant, whilst on the treatment of this disease, articles that study therapeutic innovations in the management of TB-MDR and TB-XDR or -TDR are also highlighted. As far as publications on pneumonia are concerned, there are those that analyse the progression of community acquired pneumonias (CAP) in patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, special importance is given to the initial epidemiological and clinical studies of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Also of interest is the evaluation of prognostic scales as predictors of ventilation support and/or the use of pressor amines, as well as the use of biological markers to complement the predictive value of these prognostic scales. Aetiological and clinical studies of pneumonias associated with the health system continue to be of great interest and their possible differences compared to CAPs.

In the past, the administration of convalescent plasma of patients having recovered from SARS and severe influenza to patients actively having the disease showed promising effects on mortality and appeared safe. Whether or not this also holds true for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown. METHODS: DAWn-Plasma is a multicentre nation-wide, randomized, open-label, phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Belgium. Patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 72 h before study inclusion through a PCR (nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or a chest-CT scan showing features compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either standard of care and convalescent plasma (active treatment group) or standard of care only. The active treatment group receives 2 units of 200 to 250 mL of convalescent plasma within 12 h after randomization, with a second administration of 2 units 24 to 36 h after ending the first administration. The trial aims to include 483 patients and will recruit from 25 centres across Belgium. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that require mechanical ventilation or have died at day 15. The main secondary endpoints are clinical status on day 15 and day 30 after randomization, as defined by the WHO Progression 10-point ordinal scale, and safety of the administration of convalescent plasma. DISCUSSION: This trial will either provide support or discourage the use of convalescent plasma as an early intervention for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. METHODS: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant's county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. RESULTS: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased.

Secondary superimposed pulmonary infections present in these patients were also studied. We present an autopsy series of 27 COVID-19 patients with long disease duration, where pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples were obtained.

This series includes 26 adults with a median duration of 39 days from onset of symptoms to death (ranging 9C108 days), 92% of them subjected to immunomodulatory therapy, and an infant patient. We detected gRNA in the lung of all but one patient, including those with longer disease duration. SgRNA was detected in 11 out of 17 patients (64.7%) with illness duration up to 6 weeks and in 3 out of 9 patients (33.3%) with more than 6 weeks of disease progression.

METHODS: We fit an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to data on hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy (ISARIC4C/COVID-19 Clinical Information Network, National Health Service [NHS] England), seroprevalence (Office for National Statistics, UK Biobank, REACT-2 study), virology (REACT-1 study), and deaths (Public Health England) across the seven NHS England regions from March 1, to Oct 13, 2020. We analysed mobility (Google Community Mobility) and social contact (CoMix study) data to estimate the effect of tiered restrictions implemented in England, and of lockdowns implemented in Northern Ireland and Wales, in October, 2020, and projected epidemiological scenarios for England up to March 31, 2021. FINDINGS: We estimated a reduction in the effective reproduction number (R(t)) of 2% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0C4) for tier 2, 10% (6C14) for tier 3, 35% (30C41) for a Northern Ireland-stringency lockdown with schools closed, and 44% (37C49) for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools closed. From Oct 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, a projected COVID-19 epidemic without tiered restrictions or lockdown results in 280 000 (95% projection interval 274 000C287 000) hospital admissions and 58 500 (55 800C61 100) deaths. Tiered restrictions would reduce hospital admissions to 238 000 (231 000C245 000) and deaths to 48 600 (46 400C50 700). From Nov 5, 2020, a 4-week Wales-type lockdown with schools remaining opensimilar to the lockdown measures announced in England in November, 2020was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 186 000 (179 000C193 000) and deaths to 36 800 (34 900C38 800). Closing schools was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 157 000 (152 000C163 000) and deaths to 30 300 (29 000C31 900). A projected lockdown of greater than 4 weeks would reduce deaths but would bring diminishing returns in reducing peak pressure on hospital services. An earlier lockdown would have reduced deaths and hospitalisations in the short term, but would lead to a faster resurgence in cases after January, 2021. In a post-hoc analysis, we estimated that the second lockdown in England (Nov 5CDec 2) reduced R(t) by 22% (95% CrI 15C29), rather than the 32% (25C39) reduction estimated for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools open. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown measures outperform less stringent restrictions in reducing cumulative deaths. We projected that the lockdown policy announced to commence in England on Nov 5, with a similar stringency to the lockdown adopted in Wales, would reduce pressure on the health service and would be well timed to suppress deaths over the winter period, while allowing schools to remain open. Following completion of the analysis, we analysed new data from November, 2020, and found that despite similarities in policy, the second lockdown in England had a smaller impact on behaviour than did the second lockdown in Wales, resulting in more deaths and hospitalisations than we originally projected when focusing on a Wales-stringency scenario for the lockdown.

Methods: : We enrolled 312 patients with COVID-19 admitted to seven hospitals located in Daegu. Using serum (or plasma) samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, both IgG and IgM antibodies were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-FIND COVID-19 ELISA, SG medical, Seoul, Korea). Results: : The median value from the initial diagnosis by confirming SARS-CoV-2 PCR to the sampling date was 24 days (day -1 to 88). The total positive rate of IgG was 93.9% and the positive IgM rate was 39.4%, without considering the elapsed period after diagnosis. Positive IgG and IgM rates were highest at 100.0% and 59.0% in 3 weeks (15C21 days), respectively.

The paucity of available antifungal drug classes, combined with the increased occurrence of multidrug resistance in fungi, has led to new clinical challenges in the treatment of fungal infections. Candida auris is a recently emerged multidrug resistant human fungal pathogen that has become a worldwide public health threat. C. auris clinical isolates are often resistant to one or more antifungal drug classes, and thus, there is a high unmet medical need for the development of new therapeutic strategies effective against C. auris. Additionally, C. auris possesses several virulence traits, including the ability to form biofilms, further contributing to its drug resistance, and complicating the treatment of C. auris infections. Here we assessed red, green, and blue visible lights alone and in combination with photosensitizing compounds for their efficacies against C. auris biofilms. We found that (1) blue light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms on its own and that the addition of photosensitizing compounds improved its antibiofilm potential; (2) red light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms, but only in combination with photosensitizing compounds; and (3) green light inhibited C. auris biofilms in combination with photosensitizing compounds, but had no effects on disrupting C. auris biofilms.

It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

As a result, the electricity demand has been impacted by the changes in human activity. Many of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries have adopted different approaches to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including severe shutdown of most social and economic activities. This paper analyses how this pandemic has influenced, from its appearance until the fall of 2020, the demand of ten LAC countries (Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay). The approach is based on the concepts of size and shape impacts, which have been proposed in order to decompose the problem for a better understanding of the impact. The size impact accounts for the observed variations on the daily demand, whereas the shape impact focuses on the variations observed on the standardized hourly demand profiles for each day. To calculate both impacts, the observed demand is compared to the expected one if the COVID-19 crisis had not happened. To obtain reliable estimations in the scenario without COVID-19, machine learning techniques have been used. Peru and Bolivia are the two countries where the pandemic has had the greatest impact during 2020, with a size impact in April 2020 of around -30%. At the opposite extreme would be Chile and Uruguay, with a maximum monthly size impact of -6%.

Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, while many endemic diseases have increased in incidence.

We draw attention to key differences between dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission after habitat change and after introduction into new regions. Local emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles, whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel where and when conditions (eg, hosts, vectors, and climate) are suitable for a pathogen. Once a pathogen is established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics can shape the evolutionary selective pressure and result in increased use of people as transmission hosts.

Capturing data in the moment reduces important sources of measurement error but also generates challenges for noncompliance (ie, missing data). To date, EMA research has only examined the overall rates of noncompliance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we identify four types of noncompliance among people who use drugs and aim to examine the factors associated with the most common types. METHODS: Data were obtained from a recent pilot study of 28 Nebraskan people who use drugs who answered EMA questions for 2 weeks. We examined questions that were not answered because they were skipped, they expired, the phone was switched off, or the phone died after receiving them. RESULTS: We found that the phone being switched off and questions expiring comprised 93.34% (1739/1863 missing question-instances) of our missing data. Generalized structural equation model results show that participant-level factors, including age (relative risk ratio [RRR]=0.93; P=.005), gender (RRR=0.08; P=.006), homelessness (RRR=3.80; P=.04), personal device ownership (RRR=0.14; P=.008), and network size (RRR=0.57; P=.001), are important for predicting off missingness, whereas only question-level factors, including time of day (ie, morning compared with afternoon, RRR=0.55; P<.001) and day of week (ie, Tuesday-Saturday compared with Sunday, RRR=0.70, P=.02; RRR=0.64, P=.005; RRR=0.58, P=.001; RRR=0.55, P<.001; and RRR=0.66, P=.008, respectively) are important for predicting expired missingness. The week of study is important for both (ie, week 2 compared with week 1, RRR=1.21, P=.03, for off missingness and RRR=1.98, P<.001, for expired missingness). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a three-pronged strategy to preempt missing EMA data with high-risk populations: first, provide additional resources for participants likely to experience phone charging problems (eg, people experiencing homelessness); second, ask questions when participants are not likely to experience competing demands (eg, morning); and third, incentivize continued compliance as the study progresses.

To fabricate antifogging and low-haze transparent renewable polymer materials, intrinsic hydrophilicity with high water adsorption capability of thermoplastic starch (TPS) had been adopted. Strikingly, when benzoic acid (BA) was blended with thermoplastic starch (TPS-BA), the haze of TPS-BA was only 7.8% when it suffered the cold and warm method of antifogging measurement with 87% transmittance. Simultaneously, TPS-BA achieved an 18 mm inhibition zone for Staphylococcus aureus. To reveal the antifogging mechanism of TPS-BA films, the surficial and interior structure features were evaluated by three-dimensional optical scanner, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle testing, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-dependent Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and so on. The incorporation of BA resulted in the roughness (Rq), water contact angle (WCA), and crystallinity of the TPS-BA film decreasing from 6.5 to 0.68 m, 65.1 to 39.9, and 13.6 to 6.3%, respectively. The amorphous matrix and smooth surface reduced the scattered light, allowing the TPS-BA film to achieve low haze performance and high transmittance. Importantly, the diversified and weakened hydrogen bonds formed among starch, BA, and glycerol could inhibit the formation of starch crystalline regions and allowed hydroxyl groups to quickly bond with water. Thus, when TPS-BA is placed in a high-humidity surrounding, an \\"expressway\\"is constructed for water molecules diffusing into the TPS-BA matrix.

The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2Cspike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential areas of application ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.","output":"In vitro measurements of proteinCprotein interactions show that antibody affinity governs the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding in convalescent serum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The study uses the case of an online-mediated barter economy that proliferated during the COVID-19 crisis to highlight Indigenous notions of barter, trade and exchange. Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic approach was employed which involved collecting online posts and comments which were stored and analysed in NVivo. This was supplemented with field notes and reflections from authors with an intimate knowledge of the context. These were analysed thematically. The overall methodology is inspired by decolonising methodologies that seek to restore the agency of Indigenous Peoples in research towards self-determination. Findings: Findings suggest that during and beyond the crisis, social media (a new means) is being used to facilitate barter and determinations of/accounting for value within. This is being done through constant appeals to, and adaptation of, tradition (old ways). Indigenous accounting is therefore best understood as so through Indigenous accountability values and practices. Originality/value: This paper propose a re-orientation of accounting for barter research that incorporates recent debates between the disciplines of economics and anthropology on the nature of barter, debt and exchange.

The aim of this study was to study the prevalence of subjective tinnitus and dizziness in a sample of COVID-19 patients using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire. METHODS: A multicentric study that included 15 Italian hospitals in different regions was conducted using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire developed to identify the presence of tinnitus and balance disorders in patients with COVID-19 between May 5 and June 10, 2020. The questionnaire was administered to 185 patients in a period of > 30 - < 60 days after diagnosis of COVID-19; responses were recorded in an online Excel spreadsheet. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (1) demographic information; (2) presence and characteristics of tinnitus and dizziness after COVID-19 diagnosis; (3) possible association with migraine. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (18.4%) reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19 diagnosis. Of these, 32 patients reported dizziness (94.1%) and 2 (5.9%) reported acute vertigo attacks. Forty-three patients (23.2%) reported tinnitus; 14 (7.6%) reported both tinnitus and equilibrium disorders.

Experimental infection was conducted in 90-day-old chickens, embryonated eggs and bioassays in dogs. In the first experiment, poults were randomly divided into four groups. Groups I and II were provided feed with coccidiostat, whereas groups III and IV received feed without coccidiostat. When the poults from groups I and III reached 90 days of age, they received a subcutaneous inoculation of N. caninum. Once the hens entered their egg-laying period, during the following 30 days, the eggs were collected, identified, weighed and placed in an incubator. On the 70th day after inoculation, all animals, including the chicks, were euthanized. Tissue samples from the adult poultry and chicks were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. Brain tissue and pectoral muscle samples from infected birds were fed to two dogs. Notably, the average weight of the group III eggs was lower than that of the group IV eggs (p < 0.05). No changes consistent with infection in adult poultry or chicks were detected by histopathology or IHC; moreover, no amplified parasite DNA was detected in the birds tissues or dogs feces. No dog eliminated oocysts. In the second experiment, the embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 1  10(2)N. caninum tachyzoites, on the 10th day of incubation, and chicks born from these eggs were housed in boxes suitable for the species and received commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum. On the 30th day after infection (DAI), the poultry were euthanized, and their organs were processed as described in experiment I. The amplification of parasite DNA was observed in the spleen and pectoral muscles of one of the birds. The ingestion of bird tissues by dogs did not result in oocyst elimination. These results indicate that the parasite may have been eliminated by the host and that the use of tachyzoites to induce chronic disease might be a poor source for hens.","output":"Gallus gallus domesticus are resistant to infection with Neospora caninum tachyzoites of the NC-1 strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several graph representations have been introduced for different data in theoretical biology.

Troubling disparities in COVID-19-associated mortality emerged early, with nearly 70% of deaths confined to Black/African-American (AA) patients in some areas, yet targeted studies within this demographic are scant. Multi-omics single-cell analyses of immune profiles from airways and matching blood samples of Black/AA patients revealed low viral load, yet pronounced and persistent pulmonary neutrophilia with advanced features of cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including exacerbated production of IL-8, IL-1, IL-6, and CCL3/4 along with elevated levels of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. Circulating S100A12+/IFITM2+ mature neutrophils are recruited via the IL-8/CXCR2 axis, which emerges as a potential therapeutic target to reduce pathogenic neutrophilia and constrain ARDS in severe COVID-19. Graphical Abstract The lung pathology due to severe COVID-19 is marked by a perpetual pathogenic neutrophilia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) even in the absence of viral burden. Circulating mature neutrophils are recruited to the airways via IL-8 (CXCL8)/CXCR2 chemotaxis. Recently migrated neutrophils further differentiate into a transcriptionally active and hyperinflammatory state, with an exacerbated expression of IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-1 (IL1B), CCL3, CCL4, neutrophil elastase (NE), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Airway neutrophils and recruited inflammatory monocytes further increase their production of IL-8 (CXCL8), perpetuating lung neutrophilia in a feedforward loop.

Therefore, we investigated the in vitro antibiotic activity of meropenem, precisely if 40%T > MIC is achieved in one single long period (single dose), 2  20% periods (dosing-bid), or 3  13.3% (dosing t.i.d.) thereby keeping the overall period of T > MIC constant. Material/Methods: Time kill curves (TKC) with P. aeruginosa-ATCC-27853 and E. coli-ATCC-25922 and five clinical isolates each were implemented over 24 h in CAMHB with concentrations from 0.25MIC-32MIC. Periods over and under MIC were simulated by centrifugation steps (discarding supernatant and refilling with fresh CAMHB). Double and triple dosing involved further addition and removal of antibiotic. Complementary growth controls (GC) with and without centrifugation steps were done and the emergence of phenotypical resistance was evaluated (repeated MIC-testing after antibiotic administration). Results: No impact of centrifugation on bacterial growth was seen. TKC with P. aeruginosa showed the best killing in the triple dosage, followed by the double and single dose. In multiple regimens at least a concentration of 4MIC was needed to achieve a recommended 2-3 log10 killing. Likewise, a reduction of E. coli was best within the three short periods. Contrary to the TKCs with P. aeruginosa we could observe that after the inoculum reached a certain CFU/mL (10^8), no further addition of antibiotic could achieve bacterial killing (identified as the inoculum effect). For P. aeruginosa isolates resistance appeared within all regimens, the most pronounced was found in the 40%T > MIC experiments indicating that a single long period might accelerate the emergence of resistance. Contrary, for E. coli no emergence of resistance was found. Conclusion/Outlook: We could show that not solely the %T > MIC is decisive for an efficient bacterial eradication in vitro, but also the distribution of the selected %T > MIC. Thus, dividing the 40%T > MIC in three short periods requested lowers antibiotic concentrations to achieve efficient bacterial killing and reduces the emergence of resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates. The distribution of the %T > MIC did impact the bacterial eradication of susceptible pathogens in vitro and might play an even bigger role in infections with intermediate or resistant pathogens.","output":"Challenging T > MIC Using Meropenem vs. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of cranial multineuritis after severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2. METHODS: Patients data were obtained from medical records of the clinical chart of dellAngelo Hospital, Venice, Italy. RESULTS: The first patient is a 42-year-old male patient who developed, 10 days after the resolution of coronavirus-2 pneumonia and intensive care unit hospitalization with hyperactive delirium, a cranial multineuritis with asymmetric distribution (bilateral hypoglossus involvement and right Claude Bernard Horner syndrome). No albumin-cytologic dissociation was found in cerebrospinal fluid; severe bilateral denervation was detected in hypoglossus nerve, with normal EMG of other cranial muscles, blink reflex, and cerebral magnetic resonance with gadolinium. He presented a striking improvement after intravenous human immunoglobulin therapy. The second case is a 67-year-old male patient who developed a cranial neuritis (left hypoglossus paresis), with dyslalia and deglutition difficulties. He had cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities (albumin-cytologic dissociation), no involvement of ninth and 10(th) cranial nerves, diffuse hyporeflexia, and brachial diparesis. DISCUSSION: Cranial neuritis is a possible neurological manifestation of coronavirus-2 pneumonia. Etiology is not clear: it is possible a direct injury of the nervous structures by the virus through olfactory nasopharyngeal terminations.

RESULTS: Within the study period, 65 pancreatic surgeons from 27 specialist centres in the UK (96%) completed the survey. Multidisciplinary team meetings are utilised universally for the management of patients with PDAC, however, different staging systems for resectability classification are being applied. In borderline resectable PDAC, most surgeons were keen to proceed with surgical exploration post NAT, but differences were noted in preferred chemotherapy regimens. Surgeons from standard volume institutions performed fewer vein resections annually and were more likely to deem patients with locally advanced PDAC as unresectable.

We found that the carriers were different in terms of the autocorrelation, strength of periodicity, and changes in these quantities across decades. We also found that the network structure of the individual carriers abruptly changes from time to time. Such a network change reflects changes in their operation at their hub airports rather than famous socioeconomic events that look closely related to airline industry.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the change in diet quality and in food insecurity observed during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. We hypothesized that the lockdown was associated with a deterioration in overall diet quality and an increase in food insecurity. METHODS: Data are from a COVID-19 subsample of NutriQubec, a web-based cohort destined to study temporal changes in dietary habits among adults in Quebec, Canada. Participants completed questionnaires before (between June 2019 and February 2020) and during (April to May 2020) early lockdown, including a validated web-based 24-h recall (n = 853) and a questionnaire on food security (n = 922). Primary study outcomes were temporal changes in diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and in the prevalence of food insecurity. RESULTS: There was a small increase in the HEI-2015 during the COVID-19 early lockdown compared with baseline (+1.1 points; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.5), mostly due to small improvements in the intakes of whole grains, greens and beans, refined grains, total vegetables, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, added sugar, and total protein subscores of the HEI-2015. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals aged 18-29 y (+3.6 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.7), participants with lower education (+1.9 points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6), or with obesity (+3.8 points; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.8) showed particularly important increases in the HEI-2015.

The commensurate structure with a modulation wavevector q = 5c*/6 was analyzed in a conventional manner in 3D space, while a structure model in (3+1)-dimensional superspace was used for the other two crystals with modulation wavevectors slightly differing from 5c*/6. The superstructure of the commensurate phase was described using the space group P4/n and a common superspace group I4/m(00)00 was used for the (3+1)D structures of all three crystals. The whole structure of each crystal consists of two substructures. Basis vectors a and b are common, but c is different for the two substructures. The first substructure is a host framework constructed by (Li/Al)O4 tetrahedra sharing edges. A linear connection of cavities is seen to be channel-like, in which Sr ions locate as guest cations forming the second substructure. The crystal of q = 5c*/6 contains five Sr ions per six cavities in a channel. Sr ions are distributed at seven sites, some of which are partially occupied. Statistical disorder of local structure models for the location of Sr ions in the channel was assumed to explain the results. Such a partially disordered character was also seen in the incommensurate phases and properly embodied by a (3+1)D model containing an atomic domain of the Sr ion with occupational modulation.

Patient risk stratification models to identify low-risk patients can help improve patient care processes and allocate limited resources. Many existing deterioration indices are based entirely on structured data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and ignore important information from other data sources. However, chest radiographs have been demonstrated to be helpful in predicting the progress of respiratory diseases. We developed a joint EHR and chest x-ray (CXR) model method and applied it to identify low-risk COVID19+ patients within the first 48 hours of hospital admission. Methods All COVID19+ patients admitted to a large urban hospital between March 2020 and February 2021 were included. We trained an image model using large public chest radiograph datasets and fine-tuned this model to predict acute dyspnea using a cohort from the same hospital. We then combined this image model with two existing EHR deterioration indices to predict the risk of a COVID19+ patient being intubated, receiving a nasal cannula, or being treated with a vasopressor. We evaluated models ability to identify low-risk patients by using the positive predictive value (PPV). Results The image-augmented deterioration index was able to identify 12% of 716 COVID-19+ patients as low risk with 0.95 positive predictive value in the first 48 hours of admission. In contrast, when used individually, the EHR and CXR models each identified roughly 3% of the patients with a PPV of 0.95. Predicting Low Risk Patients Aggregated predictions for COVID19 positive patients within the first 48 hours of admission, shown with exponential weight moving average and 95% CIs. Each plot shows the number of patients flagged as low-risk by lowest aggregated prediction and the resulting accuracy for that fraction of patients. The bottom plot compares the MCURES fused model to the MCURES model. The top plot compares the EDI fused model to the EDI model. Conclusion Our multi-modal models were able to identify far more patients at low-risk of COVID19 deterioration than models trained on either modality alone. This indicates the importance of combining structured data with chest X-rays when creating a deterioration index performance for infectious respiratory-track diseases.

In addition to demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural differences, hospital infrastructure and healthcare varies across all 27 federative units. Therefore, the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic did not manifest itself in a homogeneous and predictable trend across the nation. In late 2020 and early 2021, new waves of the COVID-19 outbreak have caused an unprecedented sanitary collapse in Brazil. Unlike the first COVID-19 wave, in subsequent waves, preliminary evidence has pointed to an increase in the daily reported cases among younger people being hospitalized, overloading the healthcare system. In this comprehensive retrospective study, confirmed cases of hospitalization, ICU admission, IMV requirement and in-hospital death from Brazilian COVID-19 patients throughout 2020 until the beginning of 2021 were analyzed through a spatio-temporal study for patients aged 20-59 years. All Brazilian federative units had their data disaggregated in six periods of ten epidemiological weeks each. We found that there is a wide variation in the waves dynamic due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in the first and in subsequent outbreaks in different federative units over the analyzed periods. As a result, atypical waves can be seen in the Brazil data as a whole. The analysis showed that Brazil is experiencing a numerical explosion of hospitalizations and deaths for patients aged 20-59 years, especially in the state of Sao Paulo, with a similar proportion of hospitalizations for this age group but higher proportion of deaths compared to the first wave.","output":"Young adults vulnerability to COVID-19 in Brazil: an overview across the country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The protein hydrolysates of fishes have been reported to be a potential source of many health benefits components for pharmaceutical or nutritional applications.

Inhibition of cell proliferation, percentage of apoptotic cells, cell cycle distribution, morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptotic protein levels were also examined. Decreases in proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were observed after treatment with the protein hydrolysate in a dose-dependent manner. Distinct morphological changes, a typical pattern of fragmented DNA, and increased intracellular ROS production and apoptotic protein levels were observed in both cell lines after hydrolysate treatment (p < 0.05).

Results: Cochlear implant had made statistically significant improvements in quality of life among postlingually deaf adults. The HUI3 scores were significantly better in four attributes (hearing, speech, emotion, and pain) after a cochlear implant. A positive correlation between change in hearing and improvement in emotion was significant. The change in pain and improvement in emotion also had a positive correlation. The duration of HA and CI use had no impact on the gain in HUI3 scores, and the baseline of hearing and emotion state had an influence on HUI3 gain. Conclusion: This study found cochlear implant users had a greatly improved hearing, speech, emotion, and pain, which made statistically significant improvement in quality of life among postlingually deaf adults.

A primary role of platelets is to aid in vascular injury site-specific clot formation to stanch bleeding, termed hemostasis. Platelets render hemostasis by a complex concert of mechanisms involving platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation, coagulation amplification, and clot retraction. Additionally, platelet secretome can influence coagulation kinetics and clot morphology. Therefore, platelet defects and dysfunctions result in bleeding complications. Current treatment for such complications involve prophylactic or emergency transfusion of platelets. However, platelet transfusion logistics constantly suffer from limited donor availability, challenges in portability and storage, high bacterial contamination risks, and very short shelf life (~5 days). To address these issues, an exciting area of research is focusing on the development of microparticle- and nanoparticle-based platelet surrogate technologies that can mimic various hemostatic mechanisms of platelets. On the other hand, aberrant occurrence of the platelet mechanisms lead to the pathological manifestation of thrombosis and thromboinflammation. The treatments for this are focused on inhibiting the mechanisms or resolving the formed clots. Here, platelet-inspired technologies can provide unique platforms for disease-targeted drug delivery to achieve high therapeutic efficacy while avoiding systemic side-effects. This review will provide brief mechanistic insight into the role of platelets in hemostasis, thrombosis and thromboinflammation, and present the current state-of-art in the design of platelet-inspired nanomedicine for applications in these areas.","output":"Platelet-inspired nanomedicine in hemostasis thrombosis and thromboinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social isolation and reports of insomnia. However, reports of changes in sleep duration and associated factors are few. METHODS: Data were from an online survey of adults recruited via social media that included a question asking whether the respondent slept less or more after the onset of the pandemic. Analyses determined the association between changes in sleep duration and self reported sociodemographic and occupational information; beliefs about COVID-19; changes in sleep patterns; and responses pertaining to loneliness, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: There were 5,175 respondents; 53.9% had a change in sleep duration. 17.1% slept less and 36.7% slept more. Sleeping more was related to greater education, being single/divorced/separated, unemployed or a student. Being retired, divorced/separated or a homemaker, and living in the Mountain or Central time zones were associated with less sleep. Beliefs that COVID-19 would result in personal adverse consequences was associated with both more and less sleep. However, the strongest associations with both more and less sleep were seen with depression, anxiety, and loneliness with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.92 (95% CI 1.67C2.21) for sleeping more and loneliness to 5.29 (95% CI 4.1C6.7) for sleeping less and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sleep duration since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly prevalent among social media users and were associated with several sociodemographic factors and beliefs that COVID-19 would have adverse personal impacts. However, the strongest associations occurred with worse mental health suggesting that improvements may occur with better sleep.","output":"Examining changes in sleep duration associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: Who is sleeping and who is not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundMental health issues have been reported after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, comparison to prevalence in uninfected individuals and contribution from common risk factors (e.g., obesity, comorbidities) have not been examined.

MethodsWe assessed anxiety and depression symptoms using two validated questionnaires in 413,148 individuals between February and April 2021; 26,998 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We adjusted for physical and mental pre-pandemic comorbidities, BMI, age, and sex. FindingsOverall, 26.4% of participants met screening criteria for general anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were slightly more prevalent in previously SARS-CoV-2 positive (30.4%) vs. negative (26.1%) individuals. This association was small compared to the effect of an unhealthy BMI and the presence of other comorbidities, and not evident in younger participants ([]40 years).

Such complications commonly occur during the initial trocar insertion, making this a procedural step of critical importance. Methods In 2002, we experienced, upon initial trocar insertion, a serious major vascular injury (MVI) that led to hemorrhagic shock, and we thus modified the conventional closed entry method to an approach that we have found to be safe. We began developing the method by first measuring, in a patient undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy, the distance between the inner surface of the abdominal wall and the anterior spine when the abdominal wall was lifted manually for trocar insertion and when it was lifted by other methods, and we determined which method provided the greatest distance. We then devised a new approach, summarized as follows: The umbilical ring is elevated with Kocher forceps. The umbilicus is everted, and the base is incised longitudinally. This allows penetration of the abdominal wall at its thinnest point, and it shortens the distance to the abdominal cavity. A bladeless trocar (Step trocar) is used to allow insertion of the Veress needle. We began applying the new entry technique in July 2002, and by December 2014, we had applied it to 9676 patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecology surgery. Results All entries were performed successfully, and no MVI occurred.

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, as well as in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs (72/104) corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host as well as strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 exhibits intra-host genomic plasticity and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore consumers retailer preferences during economic growth and recession periods in a Muslim-intensive country, and to compare the efficiency of retailers of different formats.

RESULTS: 414 patients met the inclusion criteria. 17.6% fewer (227 vs. 187) laparotomies were performed during the pandemic period. There were no significant sociodemographic differences between cohorts (mean age 64.5 vs. 62.7 years, p = 0.284; M:F ratio 1:1.154 vs. 1:0.928, p = 0.221). Pre-operative NELA risk scores were higher before the pandemic (mean 13.05% vs. 9.55%, p = 0.020). The commonest indication for laparotomy in both cohorts was small bowel obstruction (32.6% vs. 37.4%), treated most commonly with adhesiolysis. Postoperatively, fewer patients received HDU/ITU care during the pandemic than before (ward-based recovery 4.7% vs. 13.8%, HDU/ITU recovery 93.4% vs. 79.4%, (2)=15.4, p < 0.005). Mean duration of ITU stay was significantly shorter during the pandemic (4.5 vs. 2.7 days, p < 0.005), as was total length of inpatient stay (20.2 vs. 14.3 days, p = 0.0156). CONCLUSIONS: The overall reduction in emergency laparotomies observed during the pandemic period was potentially secondary to tighter case selection guided by objective risk stratification. Fewer patients were recovered postoperatively on HDU/ITU, and patients were generally discharged from hospital earlier. Such trends in perioperative care served to support organizational prioritization in response to Covid-19 service provision.","output":"SP4.1.3 The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on case selection and perioperative outcomes of emergency laparotomies: a UK-based multicentre cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on international medicine practice.

During the pandemic, with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education, it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. This goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. This study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. Additionally, this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. Performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender, degree, number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials, total time spent in online sessions, number of attendances, and quiz score. Asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. The proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%. Thus, practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly.","output":"Predicting students at risk of academic failure using ensemble model during pandemic in a distance learning system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the world observed an unexpected outbreak of an emerging disease named coronavirus (COVID-19) that was first reported in Wuhan city of Hubei province of China.

This role can stipulate a groundwork for further investigation of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could propose targets for specific intervention. In addition, we delineated current treatments for thrombosis and the potential therapies by using agents to block the terminal complement pathway. Low molecular weight heparin for all (unless contraindicated) hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be lifesaving.

However, the impact of the vaccine used, viral variants, and host factors on disease severity in vaccinated individuals remain poorly understood. Here we compared COVID-19 clinical presentations and outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in a tertiary hospital in Mexico City. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants were also determined to study their potential impact on disease severity. Methods: From March to September 2021, clinical and demographic characteristics were obtained from 1,014 individuals with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral variants were identified in a subset of 386 patients. We compared three groups of patients: 1) unvaccinated, 2) partially vaccinated, and 3) fully vaccinated, stratifying by age groups (<30 years, 31-60 years, and > 61 years) on the clinical outcomes, and including in-hospital mortality. We fitted different multivariate statistical models to evaluate the impact of vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 lineages, vaccine types, and clinical parameters. Results: 1,014 patients were included, with 11% being outpatients and 88% hospitalized. Most hospitalized patients were unvaccinated. In patients over 61 years old, mortality was significantly higher in unvaccinated compared to fully vaccinated individuals. In patients aged 31 to 60 years, vaccinated patients were more likely to be outpatients (46%) than unvaccinated individuals (6.1%). The percentage of critical patients over 61 years was higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated individuals (75% vs. 56%, p < 0.001). We found immune disease (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.09-8.34, p = 0.02) and age above 61 years old (OR: 3.51, 95% CI: 2.3-5.2, p = 5.9e-10) as risk factors. While fully vaccination was found as the most protective factor against in-hospital death (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12-0.46, p = 2.89e-05). Conclusions: This study suggests that vaccination and particularly full vaccination is essential to reduce mortality in a comorbid population such as that of Mexico. When analyzing the presence of comorbidities and advanced ages as risk factors, complete vaccination was the most significant protective factor against death by COVID-19. We found no strong association between SARS-CoV-2 lineages or vaccine type and disease severity.","output":"Clinical and Virological Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Variants in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Patients in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) with symptoms that mimic bronchitis and other chest infections has created a need for quick diagnosis to prevent disease spread.

The application aimed to motivate the users with notifications belonging to one of two groupstailored and non-tailored, seeing them as sparks in the Fogg Behavior Model and personalizing them according to the users Big Five personality traits.

When analyzing users as a single group, no significant differences were observed, but when proceeding with the analysis on the individual level we found seven users whose personality traits notifications interact with in interesting ways. Our results offer two general insights: (1) Using personality-tailored messaging in a dynamic mobile domain as opposed to a static domain leads to different outcomes, and it seems that there is no one-to-one mapping between domains; (2) A major reason for most of our hypotheses being false may be that messages that are deemed as persuasive on their own are not what persuades people to perform an action.

The COVID-19 outbreak impacted the 2021 IVSR match due to travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing VS, logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists. RESULTS: Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (25-41), 32.9% were female, 91.4% were US medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median 2; range 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included: program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs. Despite their high cost, away rotations played an important role in the Match, suggesting that time spent at potential institutions allowed ideal assessment of factors for students. The high average number of away rotations and in-person interviews performed in 2019-2020 was limited for the 2021 Match due to COVID-19 restrictions. Programs will have to continue developing creative alternatives or additions to away rotations and the application processes to assure continued success in future post-pandemic Match cycles.","output":"Factors Influencing Medical Student Choices in the Integrated Vascular Surgery Match: Implications for Future Post-pandemic Residency Matches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this communication we compared the challenges, teaching strategies, laboratory methods, and discussion methods used by two different instructors teaching a three-semester chemistry course The University of Connecticut offers a three-semester general chemistry course geared toward students who lack the confidence or foundational experience for a two-semester sequence chemistry course This three-semester course is taught at only two out of the four University of Connecticut campuses: Storrs (the main campus) and Hartford","output":"Teaching Chemistry in the Time of COVID-19: Memories and the Classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We review the microbiological aspects of COVID-19 infection and present the microbiological studies that should be performed in forensic cases We describe the taxonomic characteristics of the virus, its relationship with the coronaviridae family and its genetic structure We briefly present the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 infection, as well as the co-infections that could be associated with this virus In the laboratory, PCR is a first-choice technique in the acute phase of the infection, together with antigen and serological studies Finally, we describe the main objectives of microbiological studies in the deceased in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the main post-mortem microbiological analysis to be carried out in the medico-legal context The microbiological analysis should aim to detect both SARS-CoV-2 and coinfections, which may also contribute to the cause of death Resumen En este artculo se revisan los aspectos microbiolgicos de la infeccin COVID-19 y se presentan las recomendaciones sobre los anlisis que deben realizarse en casos forenses En primer lugar, se analizan las caractersticas taxonmicas del virus, su relacin con la familia coronaviridae y su estructura gentica Se presentan brevemente las caractersticas clnicas y patolgicas de la infeccin COVID-19 as como las coinfecciones que pueden asociarse a este virus En el diagnstico de laboratorio se describe la PCR, tcnica de eleccin en la fase aguda de la infeccin;los estudios antignicos y los serolgicos Finalmente se detallan los principales objetivos para los estudios microbiolgicos en fallecidos en relacin a la pandemia COVID-19 y se describen los principales anlisis microbiolgicos post- mrtem a realizar en fallecidos en el mbito forense Los estudios microbiolgicos deben estar dirigidos tanto a la deteccin del SARS-CoV-2 como de las coinfecciones, que tambin podran contribuir a la causa de muerte","output":"COVID-19 and post-mortem microbiological studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Common symptoms such as dizziness, headache, olfactory dysfunction, nausea, vomiting, etc. in COVID-19 patients have indicated the involvement of the nervous system.

It has an acceptable complication profile and amount of weight loss. However, one of the most distressing complications to the patient is reflux postoperatively. There is thought to be a relationship between a hiatal hernia and postoperative reflux. There is disagreement on how to address a hiatal hernia intraoperatively, and the use of mesh is controversial. Our objectives were to examine the use of a prosthetic bioabsorbable mesh for repair of a large hiatal hernia during a sleeve gastrectomy and to examine the incidence of reflux and mesh-related complications in the near term. METHODS This is a case series of patients with hiatal hernia undergoing a primary sleeve gastrectomy. None of the patients had a previous hiatal hernia repair. Three patients with large hiatal hernias diagnosed preoperatively or intraoperatively were included. The hiatus of the diaphragm was repaired with a posterior crural closure, and a piece of prosthetic bioabsorbable mesh was placed posteriorly to reinforce the repair. RESULTS There were 3 patients. The mean follow-up period was 12 months. There were no mesh-related complications. One of the patients needed to resume proton pump inhibitors to control reflux.

In this study, we compared the real-time, long-axis, in-plane approach to the traditional bronchoscopically guided landmark technique. METHODS Data were analyzed from a prospectively maintained PDT database at a university tertiary care medical intensive care unit. A convenience sample of adult patients requiring PDT for prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence was enrolled. Critical care fellows, under direct supervision of an attending intensivist, performed all PDTs. Tracheostomy performance from the sonographically guided and landmark techniques was compared. RESULTS Twenty-three patients were enrolled: 11 in the sonography group and 12 in the landmark group. Initial midline introducer needle puncture was achieved in 72.7% in the sonography group compared to 8.3% in the landmark group (P< .001). The mean number of introducer needle punctures  SD was significantly lower in the sonography group compared to the landmark group (1.4  0.7 versus 2.6  0.9; P < .001).

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. Results: Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001).

To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates previously reported.

PURPOSE: Gabapentin has increasingly been identified as a drug of abuse, especially when used concurrently with opioids. Rescheduling gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance may strengthen monitoring and prescribing restrictions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of rescheduling gabapentin from a nonscheduled to a schedule V substance in Virginia on discharge prescribing patterns in a health system. METHODS: This was a retrospective, pre-post, multicenter chart review conducted at 4 sites. Data from 3 months before gabapentin rescheduling (prerescheduling group) and 3 months after gabapentin rescheduling (postrescheduling group) were evaluated. The primary outcome was the percentage of newly prescribed gabapentin prescriptions upon discharge, which was compared between the pre- and postrescheduling groups. RESULTS: A similar percentage of gabapentin prescriptions were newly prescribed in the prerescheduling group as compared to the postrescheduling group (55.0% vs 50.0%, P = 0.479). Gabapentin prescribing characteristics did not differ between the groups for new gabapentin prescriptions (n = 55 in the prerescheduling group, n = 50 in the postrescheduling group). Concomitant discharge prescribing of benzodiazepines (5.5% vs 2.0%, P = 0.619) and opioids (45.5% vs 60.0%, P = 0.136) did not differ significantly between the postrescheduling group and prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions. However, fewer opioid prescriptions exceeded 90 daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) in the postrescheduling group as compared to the prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions (36.0% vs 20.0%, P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: Gabapentin prescribing practices did not differ before and after rescheduling of gabapentin as a controlled substance. There was a trend toward dosages with reduced daily MME for concomitant opioid prescriptions after rescheduling. However, additional investigation with larger studies over longer periods of time is needed to discover whether gabapentin rescheduling significantly changes prescribing practices.","output":"Evaluation of discharge prescribing after rescheduling of gabapentin as a controlled substance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the numbers of COVID\\\\19\\\\related hospitalisations in Australia after re\\\\opening the international border.

SETTING: Simulation population size, age structure, and age\\\\based contact rates based on recent estimates for the Australian population. We assumed that 80% vaccination coverage of people aged 16 years or more was reached in mid\\\\October 2021 (fast rollout) or early January 2022 (slow rollout).

We thus deviate from the common IT-as-a-stressor perspective and adopt an IT-as-a-coping-mechanism viewpoint. To this end, we apply the stressor-detachment model from organisational psychology to the use of social network sites (SNSs) in coping with stressors wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine psychological well-being as our dependent variable and introduce psychological detachment through SNS use as a mediator and moderator of the associations between psychological well-being and two COVID-19 stressors: workCfamily conflict and perceived isolation. We used structural equation modelling and tested this model with survey data collected from 398 professionals who were in lockdown and working from home during the pandemic. The results indicated that psychological detachment through SNS uses increased psychological well-being and that heightened workCfamily conflict motivated this detachment strategy. In contrast, consistent with helplessness and motivationCopportunity theories, perceived isolation as a stressor did not influence psychological detachment through SNS use. While perceived isolation directly reduced individual well-being, the effect of workCfamily conflict on well-being was contingent upon users' levels of psychological detachment through SNS use. These findings suggest that while psychological detachment through SNS use is an effective means of improving one's well-being, it can be positively or negatively affected by stressors.

Ageing is associated with progressive changes in muscle metabolism and a decline in functional capacity, leading to a loss of independence. Muscle metabolic changes associated with ageing have been linked to alterations in muscle architecture and declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. However, the biological features often attributed to muscle ageing are also seen in controlled studies of physical inactivity (e.g. reduced step-count and bed-rest), and it is currently unclear how many of these ageing features are due to ageing per se or sedentarism. This is particularly relevant at a time of home confinements reducing physical activity levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. Current knowledge gaps include the relative contribution that physical inactivity plays in the development of many of the negative features associated with muscle decline in older age. Similarly, data demonstrating positive effects of government recommended physical activity guidelines on muscle health are largely non-existent. It is imperative therefore that research examining interactions between ageing, physical activity and muscle mass and metabolic health is prioritised so that it can inform on the \\"normal\\" muscle ageing process and on strategies for improving health span and well-being.

Infection occurs after a traumatic inoculation of Sporothrix propagules in mammals' skin and can follow either a classic route through traumatic inoculation by plant debris (e.g., S. schenckii and S. globosa) or an alternative route through zoonotic transmission from animals (e.g., S. brasiliensis). Epizootics followed by a zoonotic route occur in Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as the epicenter of a recent cat-transmitted epidemic. DNA-based markers are needed to explore the epidemiology of these Sporothrix expansions using molecular methods. This paper reports the use of amplified-fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLP) to assess the degree of intraspecific variability among Sporothrix species. We used whole-genome sequences from Sporothrix species to generate 2,304 virtual AFLP fingerprints. In silico screening highlighted 6 primer pair combinations to be tested in vitro. The protocol was used to genotype 27 medically relevant Sporothrix. Based on the overall scored AFLP markers (97-137 fragments), the values of polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.2552-0.3113), marker index (MI = 0.002-0.0039), effective multiplex ratio (E = 17.8519-35.2222), resolving power (Rp = 33.6296-63.1852), discriminating power (D = 0.9291-0.9662), expected heterozygosity (H = 0.3003-0.3857), and mean heterozygosity (Havp = 0.0001) demonstrated the utility of these primer combinations for discriminating Sporothrix. AFLP markers revealed cryptic diversity in species previously thought to be the most prevalent clonal type, such as S. brasiliensis, responsible for cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, and S. globosa responsible for large sapronosis outbreaks in Asia. Three combinations (#3 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-TT, #5 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-AG, and #6 EcoRI-FAM-TA/MseI-AA) provide the best diversity indices and lowest error rates. These methods make it easier to track routes of disease transmission during epizooties and zoonosis, and our DNA fingerprint assay can be further transferred between laboratories to give insights into the ecology and evolution of pathogenic Sporothrix species and to inform management and mitigation strategies to tackle the advance of sporotrichosis.","output":"Genome-wide mapping using new AFLP markers to explore intraspecific variation among pathogenic Sporothrix species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening.

Methods: We collected all posts on Reddit from January 1 2020 - December 14 2020 (n=266,840) that contained both COVID-19 and vaccine-related keywords. We used topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence within topics after the release of vaccine trial data.

Results: There was an association between a Pfizer press release reporting 90% efficacy and increased discussion on vaccine misinformation. We observed an association between Johnson and Johnson temporarily halting its vaccine trials and reduced misinformation. We found that information skeptical of vaccination was first posted in a subreddit (r/Coronavirus) which favored accurate information and then reposted in subreddits associated with antivaccine beliefs and conspiracy theories (e.g. conspiracy, LockdownSkepticism). Conclusions: Our findings can inform the development of interventions where individuals determine the accuracy of vaccine information, and communications campaigns to improve COVID-19 vaccine perceptions.

Scant research has examined student perceptions in relation to school disciplinary approaches. This study was the first to classify school discipline approach styles using school-level measures.Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether different school cannabis use-related disciplinary approaches are associated with student cannabis use and perceptions of school supportiveness for the prevention and cessation of substance use.Results: School- and student-level survey data from Year 7 (the 2018/2019 school year) of the COMPASS study were used, including 68,037 grade 9-12 (Secondary I-V in Quebec) students attending 131 Canadian secondary schools. Schools were classified as using different cannabis use-related disciplinary styles based on school-administrator reported approaches to student first-offense violations of school cannabis policies. We identified that although none of the cannabis use-related disciplinary approach styles examined were associated with cannabis use, they were associated with student perceptions. Students attending schools classified as using a Permissive/Supportive approach had a higher likelihood of perceiving their school as supportive for substance use prevention/cessation than their peers at Authoritarian schools. Students who perceived their school as supportive for substance use prevention/cessation were less likely to report current cannabis use than their peers who perceived their school as unsupportive.Conclusions: Unlike previous studies using school classification styles that are based on student perceptions, results do not support direct associations between school cannabis use-related disciplinary styles and student cannabis use. Future prospective research should examine whether supportive disciplinary approaches (e.g., counseling referrals, educational programs) promote student perceptions of school supportiveness, and in turn, deter student substance use.","output":"The Relations between Youth Cannabis Use, School Cannabis Use-Related Disciplinary Approaches and Student Perceptions of School Support."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We write in response to an article published in this journal, \\"The U Shape of Happiness Across the Life Course: Expanding the Discussion,\\" by Galambos, Krahn, Johnson and Lachman.

A total of 279 trainee anaesthetists (Core Training Year 2, Specialty Training Years 3 or 4) were included. All participants received one initial message sharing support resources. The intervention group (139 trainees) received 22 fortnightly text messages over approximately 10 months. Messages drew on 11 evidence-based themes including: gratitude; social support; self-efficacy; and self-compassion. Primary outcomes were burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory) and well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). Secondary outcomes were as follows: meaning in work; professional value; sickness absence; and consideration of career break. Outcomes were measured via online surveys. Measures of factors that may have affected well-being were included post-hoc, including the impact of COVID-19 (the first UK wave of which coincided with the second half of the trial). The final survey was completed by 153 trainees (74 in the intervention and 79 in the control groups).

Since then hospitals have reduced inpatient and outpatient workflow and cancelled or suspended all non-emergent and routine surgical procedures. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological services. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively studied the data from January-May 2020 and 2019 about the variables: number of operations, waiting list, visits in outpatient department, bladder instillations and urological emergencies and admission rates. RESULTS Cancer cases high-risk for stage progression and surgical emergencies, were elected to proceed directly to treatment. The number of the operations was reduced by 43-65% from March-May 2020. Our surgical list had a waiting time of 6-8 weeks before the pandemic and now the waiting time has expanded to 12 weeks. Urological emergencies were reduced about 23-57%. Admission rates were dropped 10-51%. Visits in outpatient clinics were reduced 100-50% and outpatient procedures for elective cases were all deferred. Unfortunately, the hospital did not offer synchronous telehealth appointments. Bladder instillations of BCG or chemotherapeutics were not suspended but start of new cases had a delay of 2-3 weeks. There were no cases of COVID-19 in our department. CONCLUSION All the variables of our urologic practice were affected during the COVID era.

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [ SD] age, 52.8  12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0  3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5  3.8) and lower (4.5  3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4  4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7  6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease ( 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","output":"CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in 62 Patients in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E2/21-12-2020 In this study FDA approved HCV antiviral drugs and their structural analogues C several of them in clinical trials - were tested for their inhibitory properties towards the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (6M0J) using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods The most stable structures and the correspond-ing binding affinities of thirteen such antiretroviral com-pounds were obtained Frontier molecular orbital theory, global reactivity descriptors, molecular docking calculations and electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis were used to hypothesize the bioactivity of these drugs against 6M0J It is found that increased affinity for the protein is shown by inhibitors with large compound volume, relatively higher electrophilicity index, aromatic rings and heteroatoms that participate in hydrogen bonding Amongst the drugs tested, four compounds 10-13 showed excellent results C binding affinities -11 2 to -11 5 kcal mol-1 These four top scoring compounds may act as lead compounds for further experimental validation, clinical trials and even for the development of more potent antiviral agents against the SARS-CoV-2 E1/24-08-2020In this study FDA approved antiviral drugs and lopinavir analogues in clinical trials were tested for their inhibitory properties towards the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound toangiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (6M0J) using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods Amongst the drugs tested, four compounds, PubChem CID 492005, CID 486507, CID 3010249 andlopinavir showed excellent results C binding interactions -9 0 to -9 3 kcal mol-1 These four top scoring compounds may act as lead compounds for further experimental validation, clinical trials and even for the development of more potent antiviral agents against the SARS-CoV-2","output":"Drug Repurposing for Coronavirus (COVID-19): In Silico Screening of Known Drugs Against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Bound to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) (6M0J) (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is surprisingly little comparative published data on the bactericidal action of different sub-classes of -lactams against aerobic Gram-negative rods, and the assumption is that all behave in the same way.

METHODS Concentration-time-kill curves (TKC) were determined for three strains each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. All strains were susceptible to the agents used. The antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, aztreonam and meropenem. The initial inoculum was 106 cfu/mL and TKC were determined over 48 h. The area-under-the-bacterial-kill curve to 24 h (AUBKC 24 log cfuh/mL) and 48 h (AUBKC 48) were used to measure antibacterial effect (ABE). Population profiles before and after antibiotic exposure were recorded. RESULTS Against E. coli and K. pneumoniae meropenem had a maximal ABE at MIC  1 concentrations while piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime had maximal effect at MIC  4 and aztreonam at MIC  8 concentrations. Ceftazidime, aztreonam and meropenem had less ABE against K. pneumoniae than E. coli. Against P. aeruginosa, meropenem was most bactericidal, with a maximum ABE at 8/16  MIC. Other -lactams had notably less ABE. In contrast, against A. baumannii, ceftazidime and meropenem had the greatest ABE, with a maximal effect at MIC  4, concentration changes in population profiles were least apparent with E. coli.

Access to primary care is an essential component of a health care system, particularly during a pandemic. We describe organizational innovations aiming to improve access to primary care and related contextual changes, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Methods: We conducted a multiple case studies, based on 63 semi-structured interviews (n=33 in Quebec, n=30 in Nova Scotia) conducted between October 2020 and May 2021 and a review of related internal documents from both jurisdictions. We recruited a diverse range of provincial and regional stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, decision-makers, family physicians, nurses) involved in reorganizing primary care during COVID-19 using purposeful sampling (e.g., based on role, region). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo12. Emerging results were discussed by team members to identify salient themes and organized into logic models. Results: We identified and analyzed six organizational innovations. Four of these - centralized public online booking systems, centralized access centers for unattached patients, and interim primary care clinics for unattached patients and community connector to health and social services for older adults C pre-dated COVID-19 but were accelerated by the pandemic context. The remaining two innovations were created to specifically address pandemic-related needs: COVID-19 hotlines and COVID dedicated primary healthcare clinics. Innovation spread and proliferation was influenced by several factors such as a strengthened sense of community amongst providers, decreased patient demand at the beginning of the first wave, renewed policy and provider interest in population-wide access (versus attachment of patients only), suspended performance targets (e.g., continuity 80%) in Quebec, in modality of care delivery, modified fee codes, and greater regional flexibility to implement tailored innovations. Conclusion: COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and creation of organizational innovations to potentially improve access to primary healthcare, removing, at least temporarily, certain longstanding barriers. Many stakeholders believed this reorganization would have positive impacts on access to primary care after COVID-19.

The zymogen/proenzyme plasminogen is converted to the serine protease plasmin, a key fibrinolytic factor by plasminogen activators including tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Plasmin is part of an intricate protease network controlling proteins of initial hemostasis/coagulation, fibrinolytic and complement system. Activation of these protease cascades is required to mount a proper inflammatory response. Although best known for its ability to dissolve clots and cleave fibrin, recent studies point to the importance of fibrin-independent functions of plasmin during acute inflammation and inflammation resolution. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge of the enzymatic and cytokine-like effects of tPA and describe the role of tPA and plasminogen receptors in the regulation of the inflammatory response with emphasis on the cytokine storm syndrome such as observed during coronavirus disease 2019 or macrophage activation syndrome.

This study describes results of the 2019 NBCUS. METHODS The survey was distributed to all US blood collection centers, all hospitals performing 1000 surgeries annually, and a 40% random sample of hospitals performing 100-999 surgeries annually. Weighting and imputation were used to generate national estimates for units of blood and components collected, distributed, transfused, and outdated. RESULTS In 2019, 11,590,000 RBC units were collected (95% confidence interval [CI], 11,151,000-12,029,000 units), a 5.1% decrease compared with 2017, while 10,852,000 RBC units were transfused (95% CI, 10,444-11,259 units), a 2.5% increase from 2017. Between 2017 and 2019, platelet distributions (2,508,000 units; 95% CI, 2,375,000-2,641,000 units) decreased by 2.0%, and plasma distributions (2,679,000 units; 95% CI, 2,525,000-2,833,000 units) decreased by 16.5%.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the drug of choice for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, its utility in non-pregnant patients is only established against venous thromboembolism, as LMWH may have little or no effect on immunothrombosis. Decisions about initiation and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation in the context of pregnancy and COVID-19 must take into consideration disease severity, outpatient vs inpatient status, temporal relation between disease occurrence and timing of childbirth, and the underlying prothrombotic risk conferred by additional comorbidities. There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH in thromboprophylaxis, which may increase bleeding risk without reducing thrombotic risk in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Likewise, there is no evidence to comment on the role of low-dose aspirin in thromboprophylaxis or of anti-cytokine and antiviral agents in preventing immunothrombosis. These unanswered questions are being studied within the context of clinical trials.","output":"A critical review of the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications and clinical practice recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Delta variant wave of the pandemic, governments implemented health orders and policies that included citizens in lockdowns and confined to the home. These health orders and home confinement reduced childrens time for engagement in physical activity and access to supervised, structured physical education (PE) lessons. To understand the potential impact on the physiological aspects of childrens physical health literacy, one must understand the adverse consequences of detraining in relation to the reduction in physical activity and supervised structured PE lessons. The aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of how PE students were affected during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It will also discuss the impact of confinement on physiological adaptions. The article ends with a short discussion on the resumption of face-to-face PE lessons after enforced confinement and PE programming considerations. In such an uncertain environment, PE teachers need to show caution and consider the effects of detraining when programming PE lessons to ensure their safety and strategies for reconditioning.","output":"Commentary: The impact of COVID-19 Delta variant home confinement on student physical health literacya call for awareness in physical education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Planning vaccine distribution in rural and urban poor communities is challenging, due in part to inadequate vehicles, limited cold storage, road availability, and weather conditions.

Moreover, these spillovers between GCC stock markets and global factors increase in both the return and variance during turbulent periods (post-GFC and COVID-19 crisis periods). The time-varying correlations reveal that gold serves as a hedge and safe haven against most of the GCC stock markets in all sample periods, whereas the results vary across markets and sample periods for bonds, oil, Islamic stocks, and real estate assets against the GCC stocks.

However, vaccine doses are scarce and several organizational and logistical obstacles, such as the timing of and reserves for second shots and delivery failures, apparently slow down vaccination roll-outs in several countries. Moreover, it is an open question as to where vaccines are administered as efficiently as possible (vaccination centers, hospitals, doctors offices, pharmacists, etc.). The first aim of our study was to systematically evaluate the efficiency of a countrys vaccination campaign. The second aim was to analyze how the integration of doctors offices into a campaign that formerly relied only on vaccination centers affected the speed of that campaign. Using data on vaccine deliveries and vaccinations given in Germany, we find considerable differences across federal states in terms of efficiency, defined as the ability to administer the most vaccinations out of a given number of available doses. Back-of-the-envelope calculations for January to May 2021 show that vaccinations would have been 3.4C6.9% higher if all federal states had adopted a similar ratio between vaccinations given and vaccines stored, as the most efficient states did. This corresponds to 1.7C3.3% of Germanys total population. In terms of our second research goal, we find evidence that the integration of doctors offices into the vaccination campaign significantly increased the ratio of vaccinations administered out of a given stock of vaccine doses. On average, there appears to be a structural break in this ratio after doctors offices were integrated into the vaccination campaign on 5 April 2021. On average, an additional 11.6 out of 100 available doses were administered each week compared to the period prior to that date. We conclude that there are considerable regional differences in the efficiency of the vaccination roll-out. Systematic efficiency analyses are one step to detecting inefficiencies and to identify best practices that can be adopted to eventually speed up the vaccination roll-out in a country.","output":"Efficiency in COVID-19 Vaccination CampaignsA Comparison across Germanys Federal States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing interest in ameliorating multisensory perception deficits in older adults arises from recent evidence showing that impaired multisensory processing, particularly in the temporal domain, may be associated with cognitive and functional impairments. Perceptual training has proved successful in improving multisensory temporal processing in young adults, but few studies have investigated this training approach in older adults. In the present study we used a simultaneity (or synchronicity) judgement task with feedback, to train the audio-visual abilities of community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults. We recruited 23 older adults (M = 74.17, SD = 6.23) and a group of 20 young adults (M = 24.20, SD = 4.23) who served as a comparison. Participants were tested before and after perceptual training using a 2-Interval Forced Choice Task (2-IFC); and the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). After 3 days of training, participants improved on the 2-IFC task, with a significant narrowing of the temporal window of integration (TWI) found for both groups. Generalization of training effects was not found, with no post-training differences in perceptual sensitivity to the SIFI for either group. These findings provide evidence perceptual narrowing can be achieved in older as well as younger adults after 3 days of perceptual training.

Methods: Virus stability was evaluated on TiO (2)- and TiO (2)CAg (Ti:Ag atomic ratio 1:0.04)-coated 45 x 45 mm ceramic tiles. After coating the tiles were stored for 2C4 months before use. We tested the stability of both SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virions based on a lentiviral system, as well as fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the former, tile surfaces were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase virus. At intervals virus was recovered from surfaces and target cells infected. For live virus, after illuminating tiles for 0C300 min virus was recovered from surfaces followed by infection of Vero E6 cells. % of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 24 h post-infection. Results: After 1 h illumination the pseudotyped viral titre was decreased by four orders of magnitude. There was no significant difference between the TiO (2) and TiO (2)CAg coatings. Light alone had no significant effect on viral viability. For live SARS-CoV-2, virus was already significantly inactivated on the TiO (2) surfaces after 20 min illumination. After 5 h no detectable active virus remained. Significantly, SARS-CoV-2 on the untreated surface was still fully infectious at 5 h post-addition of virus.

METHODS A systematic search was conducted in EMBASE and PubMed/MEDLINE in May 2021 to identify studies examining technical skills assessment tools in laparoscopic colon surgery. Available information on validity evidence (content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences) was evaluated for all included tools. RESULTS Fourteen assessment tools were identified, of which most were procedure-specific and video-based. Most tools reported moderate validity evidence. Commonly not reported were rater training, assessment correlation with variables other than training level, and validity reproducibility and reliability in external educational settings. CONCLUSION The results of this review show that several tools are available for evaluation of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery, but few authors present substantial validity for tool development and use. As we move towards the implementation of new techniques in laparoscopic colon surgery, it is imperative to establish validity before surgical skill assessment tools can be applied to new procedures and settings.

We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9,677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5,194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5,194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (3 < MDS &#8804; 6) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34-0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS > 6) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS &#8804; 3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06).

Here we show that PGD2 signaling through the D-prostanoid receptor 1 (DP1) receptor is necessary for optimal microglia/macrophage activation and IFN expression after infection with a neurotropic coronavirus. Genome-wide expression analyses indicated that PGD2/DP1 signaling is required for up-regulation of a putative inflammasome inhibitor, PYDC3, in CD11b+ cells in the CNS of infected mice. Our results also demonstrated that, in addition to PGD2/DP1 signaling, type 1 IFN (IFN-I) signaling is required for PYDC3 expression. In the absence of Pydc3 up-regulation, IL-1 expression and, subsequently, mortality were increased in infected DP1-/- mice. Notably, survival was enhanced by IL1 receptor blockade, indicating that the effects of the absence of DP1 signaling on clinical outcomes were mediated, at least in part, by inflammasomes. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, we confirmed that PYDC3 expression is dependent upon DP1 signaling and that IFN priming is critical for PYDC3 up-regulation. In addition, Pydc3 silencing or overexpression augmented or diminished IL-1 secretion, respectively. Furthermore, DP1 signaling in human macrophages also resulted in the up-regulation of a putative functional analog, POP3, suggesting that PGD2 similarly modulates inflammasomes in human cells. These findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for prostaglandin signaling in preventing excessive inflammasome activation and, together with previously published results, suggest that eicosanoids and inflammasomes are reciprocally regulated.","output":"Virus-induced inflammasome activation is suppressed by prostaglandin D2/DP1 signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To understand the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the self-care of people living with chronic diseases and on their self-perceived health, and to identify factors that may influence the management of their disease in emergency situations.

Participants were randomized to fibrin sealant or titanium tack fixation. Patients were seen in the outpatient clinic at 1 and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS Forty patients were included of whom 34 were available for intention to treat analysis after 1 year. There were no significant differences in pain, discomfort, fatigue, satisfaction or quality of life between the two groups at the 1-year follow-up. Five patients (26 %) in the fibrin sealant group and one (6 %) in the tack group were diagnosed with a recurrence at the 1-year follow-up (p = 0.182) (overall recurrence rate 17 %).

The FG-12 isolate was found to have a 35.9 Mb genome comprised of five scaffolds corresponding to the four chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA of the F. graminearum type strain, PH-1. The genome was found to contain an approximately 2.23% repetitive sequence and encode 12,470 predicted genes. Additional bioinformatic analysis identified 437 genes that were predicted to be secreted effectors, one of which was confirmed to trigger a hypersensitive responses (HR) in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana during transient expression experiments utilizing agro-infiltration. The F. graminearum FG-12 genome sequence and annotation data produced in the current study provide an extremely useful resource for both intra- and inter-species comparative analyses as well as for gene functional studies, and could greatly advance our understanding of this important plant pathogen.","output":"Genome Sequence Analysis of the Fungal Pathogen Fusarium graminearum Using Oxford Nanopore Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on narrative of Covid-19 pandemic which plays into conservative iconic order and mentions practices to modify the neurobiological processes of individuals Topics discussed include challenges for government infrastructure responsible for medical care, questions of embodiment raised by the Covid-19 and transformation of public space into media space","output":"Arguments for a New Aesthetic of Presence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective interventions for reducing the consumption of products that harm population and planetary health often lack public support, impeding implementation. Communicating evidence of policies effectiveness can increase public support but there is uncertainty about the most effective ways of communicating this evidence. Some policies have multiple benefits such as both improving health and the environment. This study assesses whether communicating evidence of multiple versus single benefits of a policy increases its support. METHOD: Participants (n = 4616) nationally representative of the British population were randomised to one of 24 groups in an online experiment with a 4  3  2 between-subjects factorial design. The messages that participants viewed differed according to the evidence they communicated (no message, effectiveness for changing behaviour, effectiveness for changing behaviour + one policy benefit, effectiveness for changing behaviour + three policy benefits), type of policy (taxation, availability) and the target behaviour (consumption of energy-dense food, alcohol, or meat). The primary outcome was policy support. RESULTS: In a full factorial ANOVA, there was a significant main effect of communicating evidence of effectiveness on policy support, which was similar across policies and behaviours. Communicating three benefits increased support relative to communicating one benefit (d = 0.15; p = 0.01). Communicating one benefit increased support compared to providing evidence for changing behaviour alone (d = 0.13; p = 0.004) or no message (d = 0.11 p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Communicating evidence of a policy's benefits increases support for policy action across different behaviours and policies.

The aim of this paper is to estimate setting-specific vaccination thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 to prevent sustained community transmission using classical principles of airborne contagion modeling. We calculated the airborne infection risk in three settings, a classroom, prison cell block, and restaurant, at typical ventilation rates, and then the expected number of infections resulting from this risk at varying percentages of occupant immunity. RESULTS: We estimate the setting-specific immunity threshold for control of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to range from a low of 40% for a mechanically ventilation classroom to a high of 85% for a naturally ventilated restaurant.

Recent case reports found that long-deceased cadavers can produce capnographic waveforms. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of waveform capnography for endotracheal tube placement verification and detection of misplacement using a cadaveric experimental model. METHODS We conducted a controlled experiment with two intubated cadavers. Tubes were placed within the trachea, esophagus, and hypopharynx utilizing video laryngoscopy. We recorded observations of capnographic waveforms and quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) values during tracheal versus extratracheal (i.e., esophageal and hypopharyngeal) ventilations. RESULTS 106 and 89 tracheal ventilations delivered to cadavers one and two, respectively (n=195) all produced characteristic alveolar waveforms (positive) with ETCO2 values ranging 2-113mmHg. 42 esophageal ventilations (36 to cadaver one and 6 to cadaver two), and 6 hypopharyngeal ventilations (4 to cadaver one and 2 to cadaver two) all resulted in non-alveolar waveforms (negative) with ETCO2 values of 0mmHg. Esophageal and hypopharyngeal measurements were categorized as extratracheal (n=48). A binary classification test showed no false negatives or false positives, indicating 100% sensitivity (NPV 1.0, 95%CI 0.98-1.00) and 100% specificity (PPV 1.0, 95%CI 0.93-1.00).

The diseases were assessed under natural pressure except for Fusarium head blight (FHB) for which artificial inoculation with a Fusarium culmorum deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing strain was performed at the full flowering stage (BBCH 65). Fungicides were sprayed at the fully extended flag leaf (BBCH 39) and full flowering (BBCH 65) stages. The incidence of different fungal diseases was visually evaluated and other parameters [grains production (t/ha), protein content (%), test weight (kg/hL), and DON accumulation in grain (g/kg)] were also determined. In the two years, characterized by different climatic conditions, the fungicide treatments showed efficacy in controlling the observed diseases (Septoria tritici blotch and FHB) as well as in reducing DON contamination. No significant differences were found between treatments.

The partial rank correlation coefficient is employed to perform sensitivity analysis of the model, with basic reproduction number and infection attack rate as response functions. Results from the sensitivity analysis reveal that the most essential parameters for effective control of COVID-19 infection are recovery rate from quarantine individuals (delta(1)), recovery rate from hospitalized individuals (delta(4)), and transmission rate (beta). Some simulation results are obtained with the aid of mesh plots with respect to the basic reproductive number as a function of two different biological parameters randomly chosen from the model. Finally, numerical simulations on the dynamics of the model highlighted that infections from the compartments of each state variables decreases with time which causes an increase in susceptible individuals.

In this study, antibiotic removal rates, microbial community compositions, metabolite compositions, and ARG abundances were investigated in soil MFCs by adding two commonly used antibiotics (sulfadiazine, SDZ, and sulfamethoxazole, SMX), and comparing them with the addition of only a single antibiotic (SDZ). The antibiotic removal rate was higher in the soil MFC with addition of mixed antibiotics compared to the single antibiotic due to enhanced biodegradation efficiency in both the upper (57.24% of the initial antibiotic concentration) and lower layers (57.07% of the initial concentration) of the antibiotic-polluted soils. Bacterial community diversity in the mixed antibiotic conditions increased, and this likely resulted from the decreased toxicity of intermediates produced during antibiotic biodegradation. Moreover, the addition of mixed antibiotics led to lower risks of ARG release into soil environments, as reflected by higher abundances of host bacteria in the single antibiotic treatment.

The asymptomatic patients had fewer hospitalization days (P=0.043), lower total scores for bilateral lung involvement (P< 0.001), and fewer ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the peripheral area (P< 0.001) than symptomatic patients. The CT imaging-negative patients were younger (P=0.002), had a higher lymphocyte count (P=0.038), had a higher lymphocyte rate (P=0.008), and had more asymptomatic infections (P=0.002) than the CT imaging-positive patients. The RP patients with moderate COVID-19 had lower total scores of for bilateral lung involvement (P=0.030) and a smaller portion of the left lung affected (P=0.024) than non-RP patients. Compared to their first hospitalization, RP patients had a shorter hospitalization period (P< 0.001) and fewer days from the onset of illness to last RNA negative conversion (P< 0.001) at readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Significant CT imaging and clinical feature differences were found between atypical and typical COVID-19 patients for all three atypical presentation categories investigated in this study, which may help provide complementary information for the effective management of COVID-19.

A large green commercial building in Dalian, China's only country to experience five lockdowns, has been chosen. We compared the performance during the lockdown to the same period last year. The study found that the first lockdown caused a maximum 63.5% drop in monthly energy consumption, and the second lockdown was 55.2%. The energy consumption per unit area in 2020 dropped by 55.4% compared with 2019. In addition, during the lockdown, the compliance rate of indoor thermal environment increased by 34.7%, and indoor air quality was 9.5%. These findings could partly explain the short-term and far-reaching effects of the lockdown on the operating parameters of large commercial buildings.

However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. METHODS: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. FINDINGS: We assessed 155a689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114a957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115a394 patients, with 72a310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 774% sensitivity and 957% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 774% sensitivity and 948% specificity (AUROC 0940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >985%) across a range of prevalences (&#8804;5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 923% accuracy (NPV 976%, AUROC 0881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 925% accuracy (977%, 0871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 951%, admissions model 941%) and NPV (ED model 990%, admissions model 985%). INTERPRETATION: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

Following the onset of the pandemic linked to COVID-19, eastern Asia has shown strong leadership, taking actions to regulate the trade of potential vector species in several regions. These actions were taken in response to an increase in public awareness, and the need for a quick reaction to mitigate against further pandemics. However, trade restrictions rarely affect amphibians, despite the risk of pathogen transmission, directly, or indirectly through habitat destruction and the loss of vector consumption. Thus, species that help alleviate the risk of zoonoses or provide biological control are not protected. Hence, in view of the global amphibian decline and the risk of zoonoses, we support the current wildlife trade regulations and support measures to safeguard wildlife from overexploitation. The current period of regulation overhaul should be used as a springboard for amphibian conservation. To mitigate risks, we suggest the following stipulations specifically for amphibians. I) Restrictions to amphibian farming in eastern Asia, in relation to pathogen transmission and the establishment of invasive species. II) Regulation of the amphibian pet trade, with a focus on potential vector species. III) Expansion of the wildlife trade ban, to limit the wildlife-human-pet interface. The resulting actions will benefit both human and wildlife populations, as they will lead to a decrease in the risk of zoonoses and better protection of the environment. Significance statement There is an increasing number of emerging infectious diseases impacting all species, including amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The latest threat to humans is the virus responsible for COVID-19, and the resulting pandemic. Countries in eastern Asia have taken steps to regulate wildlife trade and prevent further zoonoses thereby decreasing the risk of pathogens arising from wild species. However, as amphibians are generally excluded from regulations we support specific trade restrictions: I) Restrictions to amphibian farming;II) regulation of the amphibian pet trade;III) expansion of the wildlife trade ban. These restrictions will benefit both human and wildlife populations by decreasing the risks of zoonoses and better protecting the environment.","output":"Using the 2020 global pandemic as a springboard to highlight the need for amphibian conservation in eastern Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potentially lethal infection caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global crisis.

Our aim is to document the nature and extent of academic bullying behaviors, examining who are the primary targets and perpetrators as well as the responses to and outcomes of bullying. METHODS: We developed a cross-sectional global survey aimed primarily at those in academic science institutions. The survey was administered via Qualtrics and data were collected (between November 2019 and July 2021) from 2006 individuals whose participation was solicited through various means including advertisements in Science and Nature magazines and the American Chemical Society. FINDINGS: Among the 2006 survey participants, the majority of targets were graduate students or postdocs. An overwhelming proportion of participants reported either experiencing (84%) or witnessing (59%) abusive supervision, or both (49%). While a majority of perpetrators were male, they were proportionately no more likely to abuse than females. Perpetrators were more likely from the highest-ranked institutions and they were most likely PIs. Females were more likely to report being bullied but their scores on the Tepper abusive supervision scale and the contextual behavior checklist we developed were not greater than male targets. Male targets actually reported higher levels of certain bullying behaviors. While international scholars were no more likely to report being bullied, the severity of the behaviors they reported was significantly greater. Targets (64%) were most likely to use avoidant tactics (not reporting and relying on family/friends for support) in response to bullying due to fear of retaliation (61%). The small percentage that did report the abuse (29%) overwhelmingly reported unfair and biased (58%) outcomes. Additional qualitative analysis of open-ended comments revealed similar patterns. We also noticed that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated academic bullying and changed the patterns of behaviors possibly due to the remote nature of interactions. Open-ended responses from targets are analyzed with examples provided.

Pre-pandemic living and working conditions were already stressful and difficult for these migrants. The lockdown became an additional burden, since it shut down sources of income with no assurance about when, or if, work and earning to support families could be resumed. This article draws on the lens of the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) to understand how workers engaged with and navigated these difficult times. A total of 54 migrant workers locked-down at home across the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal were interviewed for this qualitative study. Financial worries were found to be endemic, with rising debt a major source of stress, and educational qualifications becoming an obstacle to earning. Returning migrants were suspected of bringing the virus from the city, and so stigmatized in their home towns and villages. However, the pandemic lockdown also showed some unexpected healthful consequences. It provided these marginalized, and always busy workers the time and space to stop working for a while, to stay home, eat home food, and take walks in the comparatively green and clean spaces of their home environments. In this, the pandemic lockdown may be seen to have enabled a measure of agency and health in the lives of these workers, an oasis albeit temporary, and ultimately subject to the demands of the globalized cities of India.","output":"A Culture-Centered Approach to Experiences of the Coronavirus Pandemic Lockdown Among Internal Migrants in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) population in California (USA) and the Alaskan sea otter (E. lutris kenyoni) population in the Aleutian Islands (USA) chain have recently declined. In order to evaluate disease as a contributing factor to the declines, health assessments of these two sea otter populations were conducted by evaluating hematologic and/or serum biochemical values and exposure to six marine and terrestrial pathogens using blood collected during ongoing studies from 1995 through 2000. Samples from 72 free-ranging Alaskan, 78 free-ranging southern, and (for pathogen exposure only) 41 debilitated southern sea otters in rehabilitation facilities were evaluated and compared to investigate regional differences. Serum chemistry and hematology values did not indicate a specific disease process as a cause for the declines. Statistically significant differences were found between free-ranging adult southern and Alaskan population mean serum levels of creatinine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, phosphorous, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and sodium. These were likely due to varying parasite loads, contaminant exposures, and physiologic or nutrition statuses. No free-ranging sea otters had signs of disease at capture, and prevalences of exposure to calicivirus, Brucella spp., and Leptospira spp. were low. The high prevalence (35%) of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in free-ranging southern sea otters, lack of antibodies to this parasite in Alaskan sea otters, and the pathogen's propensity to cause mortality in southern sea otters suggests that this parasite may be important to sea otter population dynamics in California but not in Alaska.

An association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)specifically fluoxetine hydrochloride and fluvoxamine maleatewith decreased mortality among patients with COVID-19 has been reported in recent studies; however, these studies had limited power due to their small size. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of SSRIs with outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by analyzing electronic health records (EHRs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used propensity score matching by demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare SSRI-treated patients with matched control patients not treated with SSRIs within a large EHR database representing a diverse population of 83 584 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January to September 2020 and with a duration of follow-up of as long as 8 months in 87 health care centers across the US. EXPOSURES: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and specifically (1) fluoxetine, (2) fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, and (3) other SSRIs (ie, not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death. RESULTS: A total of 3401 adult patients with COVID-19 prescribed SSRIs (2033 women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age, 63.8 [18.1] years) were identified, with 470 receiving fluoxetine only (280 women [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 58.5 [18.1] years), 481 receiving fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (285 women [59.3%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [18.0] years), and 2898 receiving other SSRIs (1733 women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [18.0] years) within a defined time frame. When compared with matched untreated control patients, relative risk (RR) of mortality was reduced among patients prescribed any SSRI (497 of 3401 [14.6%] vs 1130 of 6802 [16.6%]; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99]; adjusted P = .03); fluoxetine (46 of 470 [9.8%] vs 937 of 7050 [13.3%]; RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54-0.97]; adjusted P = .03); and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (48 of 481 [10.0%] vs 956 of 7215 [13.3%]; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99]; adjusted P = .04).

People with MS (PwMS) may lack a clear understanding of the immunological pathways involved in MS and its treatment; effective communication between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and PwMS is needed to facilitate shared decision-making when discussing the disease and selecting DMTs and is particularly important in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. METHODS: In this patient-authored two-part review, we performed a targeted literature search to assess the need for better communication between HCPs and PwMS regarding treatment selection, and also conducted a qualitative survey of four patient and care-partner authors to obtain insights regarding their understanding of and preferences for the treatment and management of MS. RESULTS: Following a search of the Embase and MEDLINE databases using Ovid in June 2020, an analysis of 40 journal articles and conference abstracts relating to patient empowerment and decision-making in DMT selection for MS showed a preference for safety and efficacy of treatments, followed by autonomy and convenience of administration. A need for better communication between HCPs and PwMS during treatment selection to improve patient satisfaction was also identified. The open survey responses from the patient authors revealed a need for greater involvement in decision-making processes and desire for improved communication and information tools. CONCLUSIONS: This targeted literature search and phenomenological review confirms PwMS preferences for empowered decision-making in disease management and treatment selection, to optimize independence, safety, and efficacy. It also identifies an unmet need for improved communication and information tools that convey MS information in a relatable manner.

Conflicting data exist concerning the potential benefit of tapered-shaped cuffs on tracheal sealing. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of a polyvinyl chloride tapered-cuff endotracheal tube at reducing the postoperative pneumonia rate after major vascular surgery. Secondary objectives were to determine its impact on microaspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia rate, and inner cuff pressure. METHODS This prospective randomized controlled study included 109 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either spherical- (standard cuff) or taper-shaped (tapered cuff) endotracheal tubes inserted after anesthesia induction and then admitted to the intensive care unit after major vascular surgery. Cuff pressure was continuously recorded over 5 h. Pepsin and -amylase concentrations in tracheal aspirates were quantified on postoperative days 1 and 2. The primary outcome was the early postoperative pneumonia frequency. RESULTS Comparing the tapered-cuff with standard-cuff group, respectively, postoperative pneumonia rates were comparable (42 vs. 44%, P = 0.87) and the percentage (interquartile range) of cuff-pressure time with overinflation was significantly higher (16.1% [1.5 to 50] vs. 0.6% [0 to 8.3], P = 0.01), with a 2.5-fold higher coefficient of variation (20.2 [10.6 to 29.4] vs. 7.6 [6.2 to 10.2], P < 0.001). Although microaspiration frequencies were high, they did not differ between groups.

Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in influenza virus infected patients. Recent studies indicated that active glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) encoded by glucagon (GCG) gene exerts anti-inflammatory functions. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of active GLP-1 in H9N2 influenza virus-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. First, we uncovered that GCG mRNA expression levels and GCG precursor protein levels were significantly increased, but total GLP-1 and active GLP-1 levels were decreased in the lungs of H9N2-infected mice. Next, liraglutide, an active GLP-1 analogue, was used to treat infected mice and to observe its effects on H9N2 virus-induced ALI. Liraglutide treatment ameliorated the declined body weight, decreased food intake and mortality observed in infected mice. It also alleviated the severity of lung injury, including lowering lung index, decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and lowing total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, liraglutide did not influence viral titers in infected lungs, but decreased the levels of interleukin-1?, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; in BALF. These results indicated that liraglutide alleviated H9N2 virus-induced ALI in mice most likely due to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","output":"The active GLP-1 analogue liraglutide alleviates H9N2 influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Although much is still unknown about the full effects of COVID-19, recent literature supports a post-viral immunological reaction resulting in a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

Patients with severe COVID-19 are managed with oxygen support, as are at-risk individuals with chronic lung disease. To date, no study has examined whether an increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) may affect the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and co-receptors, including ACE2 and the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS11D. To address this, steady-state mRNA levels for genes encoding these SARS-CoV-2 receptors were assessed in the lungs of mouse pups chronically exposed to elevated FiO2, and in the lungs of preterm-born human infants chronically managed with an elevated FiO2. These two scenarios served as models of chronic elevated FiO2 exposure. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression was assessed in primary human nasal, tracheal, esophageal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as primary mouse alveolar type II cells exposed to elevated oxygen concentrations. While gene expression of ACE2 was unaffected, gene and protein expression of TMPRSS11D was consistently upregulated by exposure to an elevated FiO2.

Forced suction may produce disturbingly loud noise, which acts as a nonnegligible stressor. Especially, in emergency situations with heavy bleeding, this loud noise has been described as an impeding factor in the medical decision-making process. In addition, there are reports of inner ear damage in patients due to suction noises during operations in the head area. These problems have not been solved yet. The purpose of this study was to analyse flow-dependent suction noise effects of different surgical suction tips. Furthermore, we developed design improvements to these devices. Methods We compared five different geometries of suction tips using an in vitro standardised setup. Two commercially available standard suction tips were compared to three adapted new devices regarding their flow-dependent (10-2000 mL/min) noise emission (dB, weighting filter (A), distance 10 cm) and acoustic quality of resulting noises (Hamilton fast Fourier analysis) during active suction at the liquid-air boundary. Noise maps at different flow rates were created for all five suction devices, and the proportion of extracted air was measured. The geometries of the three custom-made suction tips (new models 1, 2, and 3) were designed considering the insights after determining the key characteristics of the two standard suction models. Results The geometry of a suction device tip has significant impact on its noise emission. For the standard models, the frequency spectrum at higher flow rates significantly changes to high-frequency noise patterns (>3 kHz). A number of small side holes designed to prevent tissue adhesion lead to increased levels of high-frequency noise. Due to modifications of the tip geometry in our new models, we are able to achieve a highly significant reduction of noise level at low flow rates (new model 2 vs. standard models p < 0.001) and also the acoustic quality improved. Additionally, we attain a highly significant reduction of secondary air intake (new model 2 vs. the other models p < 0.001). Conclusion Improving flow-relevant features of the geometry of suction heads is a suitable way to reduce noise emissions. Optimized suction tips are significantly quieter. This may help us to reduce noise-induced hearing damage in patients as well as stress of medical staff during surgery and should lead to quieter operation theatres overall. Furthermore, the turbulence reduction and reduced secondary air intake during the suction process are expected to result in protective effects on the collected blood and thus could improve the quality of autologous blood retransfusions.

Four phenolic compounds from plant sources were taken into consideration for the present work, and were initially screened by docking. Ellagic acid (REF) came out to be the best binder of the A? oligomer from docking studies. To test the destabilization effect of REF on the A? oligomer, MD simulation was conducted.

The CDC has established criteria for EVALI: 1) the patient must have vaped within 90 days prior to symptom onset;2) there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiographs or chest CT;3) absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up;4) no evidence alternative diagnoses.Spontaneous pneumothoraces (SPs) are often idiopathic in nature, classically in tall, thin males between the ages of 15-34 years old, as well as underlying lung or connective tissue diseases. There are few reported cases of SPs in association with vaping or e-cigarette use, with bilateral pneumothoraces being nearly unseen. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of polysubstance abuse presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of shortness of breath and chest pain. He was an active daily vaper. On arrival, he endorsed dyspnea, hemoptysis, presyncope, and pleuritic pain. Vitals showed hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Physical exam shows no trauma or tracheal deviation. Lung sounds were decreased at both apices. Chest X-ray showed bilateral apical pneumothoraces. Workup for respiratory virus panel and COVID were negative. CBC and CMP lab values were largely unremarkable, only with lactic acidosis to 4.4 mmol/L. Toxicology was positive for cocaine, THC, and opiates. A left sided thoracostomy was performed, resulting in resolution of the left sided pneumothorax. Shortly after placement, the patient traumatically removed his thoracostomy tube. 100% oxygen resulted in resolution of the right sided pneumothorax. The patient was downgraded from the ICU and discharged on hospital day three with resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION: Spontaneous pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening emergency condition. This patient's concerning presentation with spontaneous bilateral secondary pneumothoraces (SBSP) and multifocal opacities on the chest x-ray in the setting of vape use, without a prior or family history of lung disease, created a concerning clinical picture. EVALI is already a concerning condition. Per the CDC as of January 14, 2020, there were 2,668 cases of EVALI requiring hospitalization, with 68 cases resulting in mortality CONCLUSIONS: This case is highlighted in order to add to increasing evidence of the dangerous effects of vaping. Patients should be counseled on the wide variety of risks of vaping. Furthermore, cases of SBSP are quite rare, and this patient's history makes vaping and marijuana use the most likely contributing factors to his presentation. Patients with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax should be monitored over time for recurrences and counseled on vaping cessation.

The traditional univariate methods that operate within the well-established synthetic control method have strong linearity assumptions in the covariates. This has recently been addressed by successfully using univariate RNNs for this task. We use an RNN trained not univariately per series but globally across all time series, which allows us to model treated and control time series simultaneously over the pre-treatment period. Therewith, we do not need to make equivalence assumptions between distributions of the control and treated outcomes in the pre-treatment period. This allows us to achieve better accuracy and precisely isolate the effect of an intervention. We compare our novel approach with local univariate approaches on two real-world datasets on 1) how policy changes in Alcohol outlet licensing affect emergency service calls, and 2) how COVID19 lockdown measures affect emergency services use. Our results show that our novel method can outperform the accuracy of state-of-the-art predictions, thereby estimating the size of a causal effect more accurately. The experimental results are statistically significant, indicating our framework generates better counterfactual predictions. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Causal Inference Using Global Forecasting Models for Counterfactual Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With social distancing being a key preventative measure of COVID-19, proper provision of healthcare services becomes a challenge as healthcare professionals are concerned about the risk of potential infection.

BACKGROUND: TAVR is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with ESLD and ESRD, though current outcomes data are limited. METHODS: We compared 309 patients (N = 29 ESLD and/or ESRD, N = 280 control) age > 18 who underwent transfemoral TAVR from 2014 to 2020 have been compared. RESULTS: Patients with ESLD and ESRD were younger (69.9  11.7 vs. 79.1  9.8, p < .01) with higher STS-PROM scores (8.1  6.7 vs. 4.6  3.9, p < .01). ESRD and ESLD patients had similar rates of in-hospital major vascular complications (3.4% vs. 3.2%, p = .96), major bleeding events (3.4% vs. 3.2%, p = .95), and mortality (0.0% vs. 1.8%, p = .47). Mortality rates were similar at 30-days (3.4% vs. 2.1%, p = .65) with trend to higher mortality at 6-months (6.9% vs. 3.2%, p = .31) and 1-year (15.4% vs. 7.0%, p = .13). Readmission rates were higher in the ESLD and ESRD cohort at 6-months (53.2% vs. 28.6%, p < .01) and 1-year (65.4% vs. 41.0%, p = .02). One patient received dual kidney-liver transplant, 1 patient received a liver transplant, and 7 additional patients were listed for transplant. CONCLUSION: Patients with ESLD and/or ESRD who underwent TAVR had similar mortality at discharge and 30-days compared with patients without these comorbidities with a trend toward increased mortality at 1-year. This study suggests that TAVR is an option for aortic valve disease patients with ESRD and/or ESLD in order to remove cardiac barriers to liver or kidney transplant.","output":"Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in end stage liver and renal disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns for individual and population mental health Physical health consequences of the virus, public health prevention measures and economic slowdown negatively impact mental health and pose challenges for the continuation of mental health services To learn how healthcare workers responded to these difficulties, the Mental Health Innovation Network in collaboration with the World Health Organization Department of Mental Health and Substance Use launched a global call for stories from healthcare workers Published submissions highlighted innovations and adaptations in mental health support, representing a range of geographical regions, resource settings and target populations This article summarises key lessons learnt and recommendations from the project, including (1) promote access to basic needs, (2) prioritise care for vulnerable groups and people with severe mental health conditions, (3) support staff mental health, especially frontline health workers, (4) engage hard-to-reach groups through informal communication channels and collaboration with caregivers and (5) support central decision-making mechanisms and cross-sectoral coordination Using case study examples from the submissions, this field report aims to inform and inspire mental health and psychosocial support providers striving to continue services during the pandemic","output":"Stories from the Field: Mapping Innovation in Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wildlife-watching and ecotourism are effective approaches for improving public attitudes and raising awareness of wildlife conservation. However, the ability of wildlife tourism to enhance the conservation of less appealing taxa such as bats has rarely been examined. We sampled a total of 197 tourists in Monfort Bat Cave Sanctuary in the Philippines, the worlds largest colony of Geoffroys Rousette ( Rousettus amplexicaudatus ). Convenient pre/post-visit surveys were conducted to (a) explore the potential of bat-watching to raise tourists knowledge, attitudes towards bats, and determine how perceptions vary across demographic classes;and (b) determine potential predictors of conservation willingness among sampled urban tourists. Our study observed an increase in knowledge about bats and 61% of the tourists are willing to support conservation bat protection after the bat-watching visit to the cave site. Tourists conservation willingness was associated with age group, prior knowledge of bat ecosystem services, and perceptions about the conservation relevance of bat-watching as a conservation initiative. Our study highlights the effectiveness of short-term engagements such as bat-watching at improving human-bat interactions and suggests such programs should focus on highlighting ecosystem services and benefits of bats. However, it should be noted that we performed this study before the COVID-19 global pandemic and misinformation linking bats to the disease spread has increased since.

We investigated if the total COMP (COMPtotal) and COMP neoepitope (COMPneo) with other cardiovascular markers and clinical parameters could identify symptomatic carotid stenosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Blood samples were collected from patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (stenosis, n=50), patients with stroke without carotid stenosis but small plaques (plaque, n=50), and control subjects (n=50). COMPtotal and COMPneo were measured using an ELISA. Ninety-two cardiovascular disease markers were measured by the Olink CVD kit. The presence of native COMP and COMPneo was determined by immunohistochemistry. The concentration of COMPneo was higher and COMPtotal was lower in the stenosis group. When the concentration was compared between the stenosis and control groups, IL-1ra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein), IL6 (interleukin-6), REN (Renin), MMP1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1), TRAIL-R2 (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2), ITGB1BP2 (integrin beta 1 binding protein 2), and COMPneo were predictive of stenosis. Conversely, KLK6 (kallikrein-6), COMPtotal, NEMO (nuclear factor-kappa-B essential modulator), SRC (Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src), SIRT2 (SIR2-like protein), CD40 (cluster of differentiation 40), TF (tissue factor), MP (myoglobin), and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) were predictive of the control group. Model reproducibility was good with the receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve being 0.86. When comparing the plaque group and stenosis group, COMPneo, GAL (galanin), and PTX3 (pentraxin-related protein PTX3) were predictive of stenosis. Model reproducibility was excellent (receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve 0.92). COMPneo was detected in smooth muscle-, endothelial-, and foam-cells in carotid stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Degradation of COMP may be associated with atherosclerosis progression and generation of a specific COMP fragmentCOMPneo. This may represent a novel biomarker that together with COMPtotal and other risk-markers could be used to identify symptomatic carotid stenosis.","output":"COMP (Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein) Neoepitope: A Novel Biomarker to Identify Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study estimates the seroprevalence of antibodies specific to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination coverage among adults in Los Angeles County, California, in April 2021.","output":"Seroprevalence of Antibodies Specific to Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Vaccination Coverage Among Adults in Los Angeles County, April 2021: The LA Pandemic Surveillance Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Though Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRI) were used widely to correct pre-existing corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery, they have been replaced recently with the more expensive methods like the use of toric Intra Ocular Lenses (IOL) and femtosecond during cataract surgery. We conducted our study to re-evaluate the role of (LRI) in correcting pre-existing moderate corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery in settings where other options are neither available nor affordable. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive cases of LRI performed by a single surgeon at the time of cataract surgery to correct moderate corneal astigmatism (1.5-3D) in a community hospital over a period of 6 months. Corneal astigmatism, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were recorded pre-operatively, 4 weeks and 3 months post-operatively. Data on age, intraocular lens (IOL) power, predictive refraction and post-operative spherical equivalent was also collected and analyzed. The number and position of LRI was determined based on the pre-existing corneal astigmatism using online calculator. RESULTS: 29 eyes of 25 patients with the mean age of 73.6 years (range: 46 to 90 years) and corneal astigmatism between 1.5 to 3D were included. Statistically significant reduction in the mean corneal astigmatism was recorded from 2.05  0.45D preoperatively to 0.85  0.56D postoperatively (P < 0.0001). All eyes showed reduction in astigmatism; 83% of eyes had < 1.0D post-operatively and 66% of eyes had < 0.75D. UDVA of 6/9 or better was recorded in 80% of eyes post-operatively (CDVA of 6/9 or better in 100%). The spherical equivalent was within 1.0D of the predictive refraction postoperatively in nearly all eyes (97%) and within 0.5D in 86% of the eyes. There were no peri-operative or post-operative complications were recorded in any case. CONCLUSION: Combining LRI and cataract surgery to address moderate degrees of corneal astigmatism is a safe, reliable and predictable option especially in areas where more expensive methods such as toric IOL or excimer laser are not available or affordable. LRI has no significant effect on the spherical equivalent and is an excellent tool in reducing patient's spectacle dependence.","output":"Do limbal relaxing incisions during cataract surgery still have a role?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The flat occlusal plate has been recommended to reduce stress concentration in implant prosthesis treatments.

The second premolar was the pontic of the prosthesis. The three-element fixed prosthesis with a zirconia infrastructure and Y-TZP coating were cemented, in addition to using a flat occlusal splint made of acrylic resin in the region. Combined axial and oblique loads of 100N and 300N were applied. RESULTS: The tensile stresses on MT implant bone tissue produced values of 4-19% lower than those of HE implants. The lowest differences were observed for oblique loading with an occlusal splint, with a 4% (Ti-Y-TZP) and 9% (Ti-Ti) decrease. When the compressive stresses were evaluated, HE implants produced lower values than MT implants.

However, the effectiveness of these apps depends highly on their uptake by the general population. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated factors influencing app use intention, based on the health belief model. In addition, associations with respondents' level of news consumption and their health condition were investigated. METHODS: A survey was administered in Flanders, Belgium, to 1500 respondents, aged 18 to 64 years. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate relationships across the model's constructs. RESULTS: In total, 48.70% (n=730) of respondents indicated that they intend to use a COVID-19 tracing app. The most important predictor was the perceived benefits of the app, followed by self-efficacy and perceived barriers. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility were not related to app uptake intention. Moreover, cues to action (ie, individuals' exposure to [digital] media content) were positively associated with app use intention. As the respondents' age increased, their perceived benefits and self-efficacy for app usage decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives to stimulate the uptake of contact tracing apps should enhance perceived benefits and self-efficacy. A perceived barrier for some potential users is privacy concerns. Therefore, when developing and launching an app, clarification on how individuals' privacy will be protected is needed.

METHODS: A total of 117 patients were recruited and their data were collected from paper or electronic medical records. HBV DNA and liver function were measured at baseline and throughout the 24-week follow-up. The effectiveness endpoint was complete virological response. The safety endpoint was the first occurrence of any clinical adverse event during the treatment. RESULTS: Among the 117 patients, 45 had normal ALT as well as detectable HBV DNA and they were not recommended for antiviral therapy according to Chinese Guidelines (2019). After TAF antiviral therapy, the rates of patients who achieved HBV DNA <20 IU/mL at 4, 12 and 24 weeks were 77.1%, 96.7% and 96.8% respectively. Among them, the undetectable rates of HBV DNA in patients with low baseline viral load at 4, 12 and 24 weeks were 92.3%, 100% and 100%, while the rates of those with high baseline viral load were 68.2%, 94.1% and 94.4%.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 8679 STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Kaplan-Meier cumulative mortality curves for non-culprit CTO vs. no CTO were compared with log-rank test, with landmarks set at 30 days and 1 year. Adjusted Cox regression models were constructed to assess the impact of non-culprit CTO on mortality over different time intervals. Tests for interaction were pre-specified between non-culprit CTO and acute heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction. The primary outcome variable was all-cause mortality, and the median follow-up was 5 years. Non-culprit CTO was present in 11.6% of patients (n = 1010). Presence of a CTO was associated with increased early [30-day adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.36; P < 0.001] and late mortality (5-year adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.42-1.95; P < 0.001). Landmark analyses revealed an annual two-fold increase in mortality in patients with vs. without a CTO after the first year of follow-up. The observed pattern of mortality increase over time was independent of acute or chronic LV impairment.

The buffer zone lasted around 2 weeks and thrived with irony flowing on social media through memes, multimedia remixes, and jokes. As a collective ritual, irony allowed people to temporarily background the mounting feelings of bewilderment and uncertainty by foregrounding the familiar scripts of playful and grassroots expressivity typical of networked publics.

However, which of these positions is ergonomically better for the operating surgeon is unknown. In this randomized controlled trial (NCT01144325), we aimed to assess the surgeon's physical and mental stress in operating on patients in the PP compared with that in the DP. METHODS From October 2012 to June 2013, 67 consecutive patients who underwent a three-stage minimally invasive esophagectomy were randomly assigned to the DP or the PP during the thoracic stage. The same senior surgeon performed all operations. Objectively, the surgeon's spontaneous eye blink rate was recorded during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Subjectively, the physician's musculoskeletal symptoms were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (uninfluenced) to 10 (maximum fatigue). Clinical characteristics, including patient demographics and operative features of the two patient groups, were statistically compared. RESULTS There were 35 patients in the PP group and 32 in the DP group. The two groups were comparable in patient demographics. The thoracic stage of the operation was longer in the DP group than in the PP group (87  24 minutes vs 68  22 minutes, p < 0.001), and the volume of blood loss was higher (89  18 mL vs 67  16 mL, p < 0.001). The surgeon's eye blink rate at the end of thoracic stage decreased more from baseline in the DP group than in the PP group (3.0  1.4 blinks/min vs 1.2  0.9 blinks/min, p < 0.001), and the surgeon's symptom scale score was higher after operation with the patient in the DP than in the PP (6.29  1.54 vs 3.13  2.82, p < 0.001). No conversion to open thoracotomy was recorded in either group. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the PP provided less workload and better ergonomic results than the DP.

There is a rich pandemic-based evidence that shows the effect of disease outbreaks on the mental health of healthcare workers. However, inconsistencies and discrepancies have been observed among the findings of most of the reported studies. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to identify the mental health issues faced by the doctors, nurses, and other paramedical staffs as a result of any health emergency. Firstly, databases of several web sources, namely, EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were explored for searching the articles that dealt with the psychological distress faced by healthcare professionals during any pandemic. Thereafter, retrieved articles were systematically selected using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed through guidelines of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Meta-analysis was computed using R software (3.5.3) with metafor package. The present meta-analysis includes 49 epidemiological studies consisting of 59,552 healthcare workers across the globe. The results of the analyses indicated that 7% of the healthcare workers reported anxiety issues (95% CI: 0.42C1.01), 5% reported stress (95% CI: 0.29C0.69) and depressive symptoms (95% CI: 0.40C0.52), 8% reported sleep problems (95% CI: 0.53C1.07), and 6% reported post-traumatic stress symptoms (95% CI: 0.41C0.70) during COVID-19. Prevalence of sleep problems among healthcare workers was the highest during the current pandemic, as compared to previous ones. Hence it would be reasonable to conclude that medical healthcare workers involved in controlling any infectious disease outbreak are under increased psychological burden and hence and are at a high risk of developing and experiencing mental health problems. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Incorporating the Outcomes of COVID-19 with Other Recent Pandemic Outbreaks on Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Temporary COVID-19 guideline recommendations have recently been issued to expand the use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with cancer with intermediate to high risk for febrile neutropenia (FN). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz in patients with intermediate risk of FN compared with secondary prophylaxis (SP) over three different cancer types. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was constructed from the US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon to evaluate PP versus SP in patients with breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for incremental cost per FN avoided, life year gained, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with SP, PP provided an additional 0.102-0.144 LYs and 0.065-0.130 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $5,660 in US dollars (USD) to $20,806 USD per FN event avoided, $5,123 to $31,077 USD per life year gained, and $7,213 to $35,563 USD per QALY gained. Over 1,000 iterations, there were 73.6%, 99.4%, and 91.8% probabilities that PP was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per QALY gained for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION: PP with a biosimilar filgrastim (specifically filgrastim-sndz) is cost-effective in patients with intermediate risk for FN receiving curative chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL. Expanding the use of colony-stimulating factors for patients may be valuable in reducing unnecessary health care visits for patients with cancer at risk of complications because of COVID-19 and should be considered for the indefinite future.","output":"Primary Prophylaxis With Biosimilar Filgrastim for Patients at Intermediate Risk for Febrile Neutropenia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients are highly variable, with a subset of patients demonstrating prolonged virus shedding, which poses a significant challenge for disease management and transmission control. In this study, the long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were investigated using a human well-differentiated nasal epithelial cell (NEC) model of infection. NECs were observed to release SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the apical surface for up to 28 days post-infection (dpi), further corroborated by viral antigen staining. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (sc-seq) was utilized to explore the host response from infected NECs after short-term (3-dpi) and long-term (28-dpi) infection. We identified a unique population of cells harboring high viral loads present at both 3 and 28 dpi, characterized by expression of cell stress-related genes DDIT3 and ATF3 and enriched for genes involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling and apoptosis. Remarkably, this sc-seq analysis revealed an antiviral gene signature within all NEC cell types even at 28 dpi. We demonstrate increased replication of basal cells, absence of widespread cell death within the epithelial monolayer, and the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate despite a continuous interferon response as factors likely contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence. This study provides a model system for development of therapeutics aimed at improving viral clearance in immunocompromised patients and implies a crucial role for immune cells in mediating viral clearance from infected epithelia. IMPORTANCE Increasing medical attention has been drawn to the persistence of symptoms (long-COVID syndrome) or live virus shedding from subsets of COVID-19 patients weeks to months after the initial onset of symptoms. In vitro approaches to model viral or symptom persistence are needed to fully dissect the complex and likely varied mechanisms underlying these clinical observations. We show that in vitro differentiated human NECs are persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2 for up to 28 dpi. This viral replication occurred despite the presence of an antiviral gene signature across all NEC cell types even at 28 dpi. This indicates that epithelial cell intrinsic antiviral responses are insufficient for the clearance of SARS-CoV-Z implying an essential role for tissue-resident and infiltrating immune cells for eventual viral clearance from infected airway tissue in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Human Nasal Epithelial Cells Sustain Persistent SARS-CoV-2 Infection In Vitro, despite Eliciting a Prolonged Antiviral Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study was conducted to identify unmet needs through qualitative research on students who have experienced clinical practice and alternative practice that are suddenly limited to COVID-19 situations.

Progesterone has been speculated to be involved in the mediation of pathogen disgust in women, though with mixed experimental support. Here we considered the effects of acute progesterone on the disgust-like avoidance responses of female mice to pathogen threat. Estrous female mice discriminated and avoided the urinary and associated odors of males subclinically infected with the murine nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. These avoidance responses were not significantly affected by pre-treatment with progesterone. Likewise, brief (1a?min) exposure to the odors of infected males attenuated the subsequent responses of females to the odors of the normally preferred unfamiliar males and enhanced their preferences for familiar males. Neither progesterone nor allopregnanolone, a central neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone, had any significant effects on the avoidance of unfamiliar males elicited by pre-exposure to a parasitized male. Progesterone and allopregnanolone, did, however, significantly attenuate the typical preferences of estrous females for unfamiliar uninfected males, suggestive of effects on social recognition. These findings with mice indicate that progesterone may have minimal effects on the responses to specific parasite threat and the expression of pathogen disgust but may influence more general social recognition and preferences.","output":"Differential effects of progesterone on social recognition and the avoidance of pathogen threat by female mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance As an aerosol-generating procedure, traditional pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy techniques must be adapted in order to reduce the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Exposures Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures). Results The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore whether the rate of audio-only telemedicine during the pandemic is related to patient access to technology or provider behavior. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of the Summer and Fall 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey coronavirus disease 2019 supplements, using multivariable logistic models and accounting for complex survey design. SUBJECTS A total of 3375 participants in the summer survey and 2633 participants in the fall 2020 were offered a telemedicine visit to replace a scheduled in-person visit by their usual care provider. MEASURES We compared beneficiaries who were exclusively offered audio-only telemedicine to beneficiaries who were offered video telemedicine or both audio and video. RESULTS We found that among Medicare beneficiaries who were offered telemedicine to replace a scheduled in-person appointment, ~35% were exclusively offered audio-only. 65.8% of beneficiaries exclusively offered audio-only reported having a smartphone/tablet and home internet. After controlling for personal access to technology, Hispanic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.09, P<0.001], dually eligible (AOR=1.63, P=0.002), nonprimary English speaking (AOR=1.64, P<0.001), and nonmetro beneficiaries (AOR=1.71, P=0.003) were more likely to be offered audio-only during July-November 2020.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate its impact on the discharge pattern from an acute medical hospital. METHODS We undertook a hospital-based ecologic study with before-after design using the clinical management database of patient discharge records of all acute medical wards in a hospital from January to March 2002 (1 year before new system) and from January to March 2004 (1 year after restricted weekend service). The main outcome measures were the daily discharge rates for the two periods. The odds of being discharged on a Saturday were estimated by multivariate analyses. RESULTS The number of patient discharge on a Saturday was substantially lower in 2004 as compared to 2002 (47.5 +/- 8.5 per Saturday versus 70.5 +/- 11.1 per Saturday, respectively, p < 0.001). A statistically significant decreased trend was noted in the weekend discharge rate in 2002 and 2004 (Poisson p-value for change in discharge rate, p < 0.001). On the other hand, the number of patient discharges on weekdays did not differ between the two periods. Consistently fewer patients were being discharged on Sundays and Mondays as compared to the rest of the week days in both periods. Compared with study period 2002, patients hospitalized in 2004 (with limited weekend service) had significantly lower multivariate-adjusted odds of being discharged on a Saturday (odds ratio of 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval 0.72-0.89, p < 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to investigate how individual-level housing and neighbourhood characteristics are associated with COVID-19 mortality in older adults. METHODS: For this population-based, observational study, we used data from the cause-of-death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to identify recorded COVID-19 mortality and mortality from other causes among individuals (aged 70 years) in Stockholm county, Sweden, between March 12 and May 8, 2020. This information was linked to population-register data from December, 2019, including socioeconomic, demographic, and residential characteristics. We ran Cox proportional hazards regressions for the risk of dying from COVID-19 and from all other causes. The independent variables were area (m(2)) per individual in the household, the age structure of the household, type of housing, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the borough, and neighbourhood population density. All models were adjusted for individual age, sex, country of birth, income, and education. FINDINGS: Of 279 961 individuals identified to be aged 70 years or older on March 12, 2020, and residing in Stockholm in December, 2019, 274 712 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study population. Between March 12 and May 8, 2020, 3386 deaths occurred, of which 1301 were reported as COVID-19 deaths. In fully adjusted models, household and neighbourhood characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Compared with living in a household with individuals aged 66 years or older, living with someone of working age (<66 years) was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio 16; 95% CI 13C20). Living in a care home was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (41; 35C49) compared with living in independent housing. Living in neighbourhoods with the highest population density (5000 individuals per km(2)) was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (17; 11C24) compared with living in the least densely populated neighbourhoods (0 to <150 individuals per km(2)). INTERPRETATION: Close exposure to working-age household members and neighbours is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Similarly, living in a care home is associated with increased mortality, potentially through exposure to visitors and care workers, but also due to poor underlying health among care-home residents. These factors should be considered when developing strategies to protect this group.

METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for 12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received 1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the 1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the 1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to 1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received 1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the 1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received 1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

However, a theoretical understanding of the relationship between hand hygiene frequency and change in risk of infection is lacking. Using a simple model-based framework for understanding the determinants of hand hygiene effectiveness in preventing viral respiratory tract infections, we show that a crucial, but overlooked, determinant of the relationship between hand hygiene frequency and risk of infection via indirect transmission is persistence of viable virus on hands. If persistence is short, as has been reported for influenza, hand-washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination to substantially reduce the probability of infection. When viable virus survival is longer (e.g. in the presence of mucus or for some enveloped viruses) less frequent hand washing can substantially reduce the infection probability. Immediate hand washing after contamination is consistently more effective than at fixed-time intervals. Our study highlights that recommendations on hand hygiene should be tailored to persistence of viable virus on hands and that more detailed empirical investigations are needed to help optimize this key intervention.","output":"The potential impact of intensified community hand hygiene interventions on respiratory tract infections: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sequence Read Archive (SRA, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis.

This study used high-resolution X-ray crystallography to demonstrate the detailed nature of the interactions between CBD and the NavMs voltage-gated sodium channel, and electrophysiology to show the functional effects of binding CBD to these channels. CBD binds at a novel site at the interface of the fenestrations and the central hydrophobic cavity of the channel. Binding at this site blocks the transmembrane-spanning sodium ion translocation pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for channel inhibition. Modelling studies suggest why the closely-related psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol may not have the same effects on these channels. Finally, comparisons are made with the TRPV2 channel, also recently proposed as a target site for CBD.

Special attention needs to be directed towards families with children with special educational needs. Since there are relatively few studies analysing the coherence of effective cooperation with educators during the pandemic, especially in our surroundings, this study aimed to examine whether certain sociodemographic characteristics of educators (years of work experience and professional qualifications) are related to specific aspects of the quality ofpartnerships and cooperation in early childhood and preschool education institutions during the pandemic. For the purpose of this study, a Questionnaire on the quality ofpartnerships between educators and parents during the out-of-the-ordinary life circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was developed and distributed to 313 educators. Correlation coefficients were calculated to test the relationship between the educators' self-assessment of their partnerships and cooperation with parents and their work experience (in years), as well as their professional qualifications. Analysis of variance was used to test the differences in the assessment of some aspects of cooperation with regards to the work experience of the educators. The results show that educators assess their partnerships with parents during the pandemic as being of high quality and perceive themselves as competent in building partnerships with parents of all children, as well as in providing support to parents of children with disabilities. Educators with more y ars of work experience consider themselves as less competent in using digital technology and believe that they need more theoretical knowledge and practical experience in this aspect.","output":"Izazovi Partnerstva U Ustanovama Ranoga I Pred?kolskoga Odgoja I Obrazovanja U Vrijeme Pandemije Koronavirusa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the healthcare utilization and costs associated with the interdisciplinary treatment of pediatric persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS).

Telehealth could be an innovative approach to palliative care delivery, enabling patients to spend more time or even remain at home, if they wish, throughout the illness trajectory. However, no previous systematic mixed studies reviews have synthesized evidence on patients experiences of the advantages and challenges of telehealth for home-based palliative care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic mixed studies review is to critically appraise and synthesize findings from studies that investigated patients use of telehealth in home-based palliative care with a focus on the advantages and challenges experienced by the patients. METHODS: This article describes the protocol for a systematic mixed studies review with a convergent design. The reporting will be guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. A systematic search was performed in eight databases for studies published from January 2010 to June 2020. The search will be updated in 2021. Pairs of authors will independently assess eligibility, extract data, and assess methodological quality. The data will then be analyzed using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: We describe the rationale and design of a systematic mixed studies review. The database searches were performed on June 25, 2020. Assessment of eligibility and further steps have not yet been performed. Results are anticipated by August 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Following the ethos of patient-centered palliative care, this systematic mixed studies review could lead to recommendations for practice and policy, enabling the development and implementation of telehealth applications and services that align with patients preferences and needs at home.

Information about the process and BPOM's distribution permit requirements was very limited for SMFI managers, and large capital was needed to fulfill the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices. Therefore, SMFIs should have long-term cooperation with farmers to ensure the availability of raw materials;build networks and maintain cooperation with customers;and utilize credit for MSMEs in the economic recovery program provided by the government to meet the GMP requirements in BPOM's distribution permit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive, analytical study, 154 patients with type 2 diabetes referred to Kosar Hospital in Semnan were evaluated. After recording their demographic information, samples were received for biochemical testing. The patients neuropathy was then evaluated based on the United Kingdom screening test (UKST). The results were recorded in the data collection form and then analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22 software. RESULTS: In this study, 154 patients were studied, including 49 with subclinical hypothyroidism and 105 with euthyroid. The results of the present study showed that the mean age of patients in the subclinical hypothyroid group was 60.08 years and in the euthyroid group was 60.77 years. Mean  standard deviation (SD) of the patients age, blood pressure, duration of diabetes, body mass index, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and Glucose, and 2-hour post prandial (2HPP) were not statistically significant between the two groups.

Implementation of cardioprotective strategies as part of breast cancer treatment are needed. To date, a limited number of studies have examined the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation programs or exercise programs in the prevention of cardiotoxicity through an integral assessment of cardiac function. The ONCORE study proposes an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program as a non-pharmacological tool for the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: The study protocol describes a prospective, randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether an intervention through an exercise-based CR program can effectively prevent cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines and/or anti-HER2 antibodies in women with breast cancer. Three hundred and forty women with breast cancer at early stages scheduled to receive cardiotoxic chemotherapy will be randomly assigned (1:1) to participation in an exercise-based CR program (intervention group) or to usual care and physical activity recommendation (control group). Primary outcomes include changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain as markers of cardiac dysfunction assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary outcomes comprise levels of cardiovascular biomarkers and cardiopulmonary function through peak oxygen uptake determination, physical performance and psychosocial status. Supervised exercise program-related outcomes including safety, adherence/compliance, expectations and physical exercise in- and out-of-hospital are studied as exploratory outcomes. Transthoracic echocardiography, clinical test and questionnaires will be performed at the beginning and two weeks after completion of chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: The growing incidence of breast cancer and the risk of cardiotoxicity derived from cancer treatments demand adjuvant cardioprotective strategies. The proposed study may determine if an exercise-based CR program is effective in minimizing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in this population of women with early-stage breast cancer.

The inhibition of both MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways reduced the expression of NOS2, IP-10 and TNF, IL-8 production was decreased by the inhibition of AMPK and PKD, the upstream kinase of HSP27. HSP27 phosphorylation was inhibited by NB 142, a PKD inhibitor. The expression of CD80 (M1 marker) was reduced by MAPK and JAK/STAT inhibitors, without increasing CD206 (M2 marker). On the other hand, CD206 was reduced by PKD and AMPK inhibitors, without increasing CD80 marker. Phagocytic capacity of HL-60 derived macrophages was higher in M1 macrophages and decreased by trametinib and a p38 inhibitor, while in human blood macrophages, where AT 9283, a JAK/STAT inhibitor also caused a significant decrease in M1 polarized macrophages, no difference was observed between M1 and M2 macrophages. Our results suggest that the repolarization of macrophages cannot be achieved by inhibiting their signaling pathways; nevertheless, the expression of certain polarization markers was decreased, therefore a depolarization could be observed both in M1 and M2 polarized cells. Selected protein kinase inhibitors of M1 polarization, decreasing NOS 2 and inflammatory cytokines may be potential candidates for therapeutical trials against inflammatory diseases.","output":"Production of NOS2 and inflammatory cytokines is reduced by selected protein kinase inhibitors with partial repolarization of HL-60 derived and human blood macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has challenged hospitals and pediatric emergency department (PED) providers to rapidly adjust numerous facets of the care of critically ill or injured children to minimize health care worker (HCW) exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

METHODS: As part of our PED's initiative to optimize clinical care and HCW safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, regular multidisciplinary systems and process simulation sessions were conducted. These sessions allowed us to evaluate and reorganize patient flow, test and improve communication modalities, alter the process for consultation in resuscitations, and teach and reinforce the appropriate donning and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Simulation was a highly effective method to disseminate new practices to PED staff. Numerous workflow modifications were implemented as a result of our in situ systems and process simulations. Total number of persons in the resuscitation room was minimized, use of a \\"command post\\" with remote providers was initiated, communication devices and strategies were trialed and adopted, and personal protective equipment standards that optimized HCW safety and communication were enacted.

In this study, the immunomodulatory properties of a polysaccharide that was isolated from the coral Pseudopterogorgia americana (PPA) were investigated. PPA increased the expression levels of tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide, in macrophages. A mechanistic study revealed that PPA activated macrophages through the toll-like receptor-4 and induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase C (PKC)-, PKC- and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and activated NF-B. The inhibition of ROS and knockdown of PKC- reduced PPA-mediated TNF- and IL-6 expression; however, the knockdown of PKC- significantly increased PPA-mediated TNF- expression. In addition, the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1/2 and NF-B reduced PPA-mediated TNF-, IL-6 and COX-2 expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of ROS, MAPK and PKC-/ reduced PPA-mediated NF-B activation, indicating that ROS, MAPK and PKC-/ function as upstream signals of NF-B. Finally, PPA treatment decreased the phagocytosis activity of macrophages and reduced cytokine expression in bacteria-infected macrophages.

However, achieving strong and long-lasting anti-tumor immunity with peptide vaccines for the antigen-specific treatment of cancer is challenging, in part because their efficacy depends on strong adjuvants or immunomodulators. We approached this problem by conjugating an epitope-based cancer vaccine with a lipidated sequence (an immunomodulator) to elicit a strong immune response. Lipidated and non-lipidated polyepitope proteins were generated that contained the universal T helper cell epitope (pan-DR), B cell epitopes, and the extended loop sequence of extracellular domain 2 of tumor-associated antigen L6 (TAL6). We show that the lipidated polyepitope cancer vaccine can activate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, and trigger effective antigen-specific antibody and T helper cell responses, more effectively than the non-lipidated vaccine. Moreover, potent T cell immune responses were elicited in mice inoculated with the lipidated polyepitope cancer vaccine, providing protective antitumor immunity in mice bearing TAL6 tumors. Our study demonstrates that a lipidated polyepitope cancer vaccine could be employed to generate potent anti-tumor immune responses, including humoral and cellular immunity, which could be beneficial in the treatment of TAL6(+) cancer.","output":"A Polypeptide of Tumor-Associated Antigen L6 with Intrinsic Adjuvant Activity Enhances Antitumor Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: End stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cancer have been identified as risk factors for severe and fatal cases of COVID-19, making vaccination in these patients a priority.

He developed a severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia twenty days after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Whole genome sequencing found that the virus belonged to the 20I/501Y.V1 clade. A serology draws eight days after the 2 nd vaccine dose showed positive RBD IgG without neutralizing activity. A serum specimen sampled thirty days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed seroconversion against both RBD and N antigens. This specimen was shown to exhibit a frank neutralizing activity. The QuantiFERON? SARS-CoV-2 (Qiagen) showed a positive specific cellular response although the QuantiFERON monitor displayed a weak cellular response.

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSAs goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 17 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation timing. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","output":"The Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19: Molecular Diagnostic Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significance of communication in health and development is well recognised. Strategic communication informs, educates and influences. In addressing varied health and development issues, including the challenges involving diseases control, more targeted communication strategies are designed to make optimum use of available resources to achieve the planned results in a given context. Based on research, that is, the community-based study of risk factors and the operational research, communication theories evolved and so did the strategies and practices for result-driven health and development communication. In this article, some approaches have been examined to better understand the role of strategic communication in development and health, including disease control. Information dissemination through 'extension approach', first for agriculture development and later for family planning, adapted and boosted through advertising and marketing frameworks led to wide awareness about the methods and techniques of family planning but not the adoption at the same levels. Experience and research studies demonstrated that mere 'awareness' was not adequate for fostering adoption of 'new' practices;instead, it required sustained investments in communication for social and behavioural change processes. For this, bottom-up communication design, participatory communication with community involvement, evidence-based advocacy and preparedness for risk communication are required for effective communication and health and development. As HIV/AIDS posed an initial challenge for communication scholars earlier in the 1980s, so is the COVID-19 pandemic throwing a major communication challenge today. The article attempts to analyse the approaches and shed light on the role of communication in health and development, especially in the context of health crisis.","output":"Strategic communication in health and development: concepts, applications and programming.

This reformulation was even more challenging than initially anticipated as it was implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic. As TPL learning practises are based on the operation of laboratory modules mimicking heat and mass transfer phenomena, asynchronous and on-line synchronous learning classes and face-to-face laboratory classes were outlined. To promote the asynchronous learning, a full script of TPL and pitch and longer videos presenting, respectively, each work and its practical operation process were formerly prepared and available online. Students were required to work in group to define the variables and conditions to be evaluated in each laboratory module, organize and plan the experimental activities, create data recording documents, and later present and argue their options in virtual synchronous classes. In the face-to-face classes, different activities were performed in a rotating system, scheduled and tuned in the online classes. It was also aimed in-situ promoting peer discussion of the data and reports elaboration, goals not attained due to the pandemic restrictions, as only two students of each group were present in each hands-on class and in sequential times. TPL reformulation was a tough and time-consuming task since 73 students were enrolled, divided into 3 shifts, each one with 5 groups of five students. Students individual learning evolution was inferred through online quizzes that were periodically made available. A final inquiry, launched to obtain students\` opinion about this transformation endeavour highlighted the script, videos, and the prompt teachers feedback on the reports as the most fruitful and important aspects for students engagement and guide their learning pathway.

The patients with CNS symptoms were determined. Data regarding clinical symptoms and laboratory tests were collected from medical records. Results Of 1268 patients studied, 162 (12.8%) had CNS symptoms, manifested as unconsciousness (71, 5.6%), coma (69, 5.4%), dysphoria (50, 3.9%), somnolence (34, 2.7%) and convulsion (3, 0.2%), which were observed at median of 14 (interquartile range 9-18) days after symptom onset and significantly associated with older age (OR=5.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.78-11.73), male (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.22-2.47) and preexisting hypertension (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.23-2.57). The presence of CNS symptoms could be predicted by abnormal laboratory tests across various clinical stages, including by lymphocyte counts of <0.93109/L, LDH435 U/L and IL-628.83 pg/L at 0-10 days post disease; by lymphocyte count<0.86109/L, IL-2R949 U/L, LDH382 U/L and WBC8.06109/L at 11-20 days post disease.

In the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of delirium is independently predictive of excess death, length of stay, cost of care, and acquired dementia. There are numerous neurotransmitter/functional and/or injury-causing hypotheses rather than a unifying mechanism for delirium. Without using a validated delirium instrument, delirium can be misdiagnosed (under, but also overdiagnosed and trivialized), supporting the recommendation to use a monitoring instrument routinely. The best-validated ICU bedside instruments are CAM-ICU and ICDSC, both of which also detect subsyndromal delirium. Both tools have some inherent limitations in the neurologically injured patients, yet still provide valuable information about delirium once the sequelae of the primary injury settle into a new post-injury baseline. Now it is known that antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications do not reliably improve brain function in critically ill delirious patients. ICU teams should systematically screen for predisposing and precipitating factors. These include exacerbations of cardiac/respiratory failure or sepsis, metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, dysnatremia, uremia and ammonemia) receipt of psychoactive medications, and sensory deprivation through prolonged immobilization, uncorrected vision and hearing deficits, poor sleep hygiene, and isolation from loved ones so common during COVID-19 pandemic.

Using a semi-structured interview guide, information was collected on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about creating a PHO; barriers and facilitators to creating and sustaining a PHO; legal considerations; and human resource and information technology requirements. Common themes of the responses were identified. RESULTS The majority of participants supported the development of a national PHO, recognized its value in informing their work, and indicated that a national PHO could 1) provide information to support evidence-informed decision-making for health policy and strategic planning; 2) facilitate data management by establishing data policies, procedures, and standards; 3) increase the use of data by synthesizing and disseminating information; and 4) provide data for benchmarking. However, a number of barriers were identified, including 1) the perception that data collection is not valued; 2) untimely availability of data; 3) limited data synthesis, dissemination, and utilization to inform decision-making; and 4) challenges related to the allocation of human resources and existing information technology.

The main question that infection prevention and control department is having these days is Why have hospital-associated infections (HAIs) reduced during COVID-19 pandemic? What is the one unique strategy that has brought decline in increasing HAIs? Would it be appropriate to say that rigorous hand hygiene practices among health care workers (HCWs) have reduced HAIs in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan? This commentary is written to understand the effect of rigorous hand hygiene among HCWs on number of HAIs during COVID-19 pandemic. Given the seriousness of this outbreak, it was observed that the hand hygiene has occupied a new place of importance in the minds of HCWs. We observed 4 times increase in the consumption of hand sanitizers after COVID-19 outbreak. The increased consumption of hand sanitizers was reflected in improved hand hygiene practices. A reduction was observed in the number of HAIs after the COVID-19 outbreak, and we assume that the dip in HAIs is associated with the improvement in hand hygiene practices in the recent months. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, these trends reassure us that hand hygiene compliance by HCWs alone can be effective in reducing HAIs in a hospital setting.","output":"Rigorous Hand Hygiene Practices Among Health Care Workers Reduce Hospital-Associated Infections During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated university students remote teaching experiences, how they predict psychological well-being, and whether the predictions vary depending on students motivation. Self-reports were collected from Finnish university students (N = 2686). Within the latent variable modeling framework, we classified students according to their expectancy-value-cost profiles, compared latent means, and tested whether the predictions differed across groups. Six groups described the data best: moderately motivated, utility-oriented, disengaged, indifferent, positively ambitious, and struggling ambitious. The groups differed significantly on remote teaching experiences and well-being, but predictions were similar across the groups: Engagement was predicted positively by evaluation of remote teaching and negatively by perceived strain, exhaustion positively by evaluation of teaching and perceived strain, and depressive symptoms by perceived strain and sense of alienation. Findings suggest that remote teaching experiences during the pandemic contribute to students psychological well-being in distinct ways, and that certain motivational mindsets might buffer against the negative effects.","output":"Feeling exhausted and isolated?

Platelets are one of the cellular entities that exert considerable immune, antibacterial, and antiviral actions, and are therefore active participants in the host response. Platelets are sensitive to surrounding inflammatory stimuli and contribute to the immune response by multiple mechanisms, including endowing the endothelium with a proinflammatory phenotype, enhancing and amplifying leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, promoting the effector functions of immune cells, and ensuring an optimal adaptive immune response. During infection, pathogens and their products influence the platelet response and can even be toxic. However, platelets are able to sense and engage bacteria and viruses to assist in their removal and destruction. Platelets greatly contribute to host defense by multiple mechanisms, including forming immune complexes and aggregates, shedding their granular content, and internalizing pathogens and subsequently being marked for removal. These processes, and the nature of platelet function in general, cause the platelet to be irreversibly consumed in the execution of its duty. An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response to infection can drive platelet dysfunction, where platelets are inappropriately activated and face immunological destruction. While thrombocytopenia may arise by condition-specific mechanisms that cause an imbalance between platelet production and removal, this review evaluates a generic large-scale mechanism for platelet depletion as a repercussion of its involvement at the nexus of responses to infection.","output":"A Champion of Host Defense: A Generic Large-Scale Cause for Platelet Dysfunction and Depletion in Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endovascular approach is the first-choice treatment in patients suffering from aortoiliac occlusions.

Building upon an interest in tailoring antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery for client-centered needs, the Ministry of Health and Population in Haiti formally endorsed multiple-month dispenses (MMD) in the 2016 national ART guidelines This study explores heterogeneity in retention in care with MMD for specific Haitian populations living with HIV and evaluates if a targeted algorithm for optimal ART prescription intervals is warranted in Haiti. METHODS: This study included ART-na?ve individuals who started ART on or after January 1st, 2017 in Haiti. To identify subgroups in which to explore heterogeneity of retention, we implemented a double-lasso regression method to determine which individual characteristics would define the subgroups. Characteristics evaluated for potential subgroup definition included: sex, age category, WHO clinical stage, and body mass index category. We employed instrumental variable models to estimate the causal effect of increasing ART dispensing length on ART retention, by client subgroup. The outcome of interest was retention in care after one year in treatment. We then estimated the marginal effect of a 30-day increase to ART dispensing length to retention in care for each of these subgroups. RESULTS: There was evidence for heterogeneity in the effect of extending ART dispensing intervals on retention by WHO clinical stage. We observed significant improvements to retention in care at one year with a 30-day increase in ART dispense length for all subgroups defined by WHO clinical stages 1-4. The effects ranged from a 14.7% increase (95% CI: 12.4-17.0) to the likelihood of retention for people with HIV in WHO stage 1 to a 21.6% increase (95% CI: 18.7-24.5) to the likelihood of retention for those in WHO stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: All the subgroups defined by WHO clinical stage experienced a benefit of extending ART intervals to retention in care at one year. Though the effect did differ slightly by WHO stage, the effects went in the same direction and were of similar magnitude. Therefore, a standardized recommendation for MMD among those living with HIV and new on ART is appropriate for Haiti treatment guidelines.","output":"A sub-group evaluation of the multi-month dispensing strategy for differentiated HIV care: is personalization of care guidelines warranted in Haiti?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This online cross-sectional survey assesses the signs/symptoms, the protective measures taken and the awareness and risk perception regarding COVID-19 among Italian dental hygienists.

This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent [Formula: see text] queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","output":"Prediction of personal protective equipment use in hospitals during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Tochen's formula [TF, body weight (kg) plus 6 cm], nasal septum to ear tragus length (NTL) + 1 cm, and Neonatal Resuscitation Program gestational age (NRP-GA) and body weight (NRP-BW)-based intubation table in estimating the oro-tracheal intubation length, and to improve the estimation efficacy using anthropometric measurements in Taiwanese neonates. Study design: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a neonatal intensive care unit in Taipei, Taiwan. One hundred intubated neonates were enrolled. The estimated intubation depth was defined as being mid-tracheal concordant if it placed the endotracheal tip between the upper border of the first and the lower border of the second thoracic vertebra. A linear regression model was used to analyze the relationships between mid-tracheal depth and body weight (BW), NTL and gestational age (GA), and to revise the NRP intubation tables using our results. Results: Overall, 56% of the neonates were born at a GA  28 weeks and 48% had a BW  1,000 g.

The relationships between depression, disease symptoms and mindfulness have not previously been considered within the theory of SWB homeostasis. This theory states that SWB is normally maintained by a homeostatic system around a setpoint range but can fail when psychological challenges dominate consciousness. This study explored the relationship among SWB and patient-reported psychological and IBD symptoms and investigated whether mindfulness practice is independently associated with SWB homeostatic resilience. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study recruited participants through online IBD support groups. METHODS: Participants (n = 739; 62% Crohn's disease) detailed symptoms of depression and stress, patient-reported disease symptoms, and regularity of mindfulness practice.

We briefly review La and LARP7 activities for RNA 3' end binding and protection from exonucleases before moving to the more recently uncovered poly(A)-related activities of LARP1 and LARP4. Two features shared by LARP1 and LARP4 are direct binding to poly(A) and to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP, also known as PABPC1). LARP1, LARP4 and other proteins involved in mRNA translation, deadenylation, and decay, contain PAM2 motifs with variable affinities for the MLLE domain of PABP. We discuss a model in which these PABP-interacting activities contribute to poly(A) pruning of active mRNPs. Evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus targets PABP, LARP1, LARP 4 and LARP 4B to control mRNP activity is also briefly reviewed. Recent data suggests that LARP4 opposes deadenylation by stabilizing PABP on mRNA poly(A) tails. Other data suggest that LARP1 can protect mRNA from deadenylation. This is dependent on a PAM2 motif with unique characteristics present in its La-module.

We conducted semistructured interviews with administrators across University of Florida (UF) Health. We performed an inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts. Results. Four themes emerged from the interviews: 1) common types of health systems or hospital operations data; 2) public health and other external data sources; 3) data interaction, integration, and exchange; and 4) novelty and evolution in data, information, or tools used over time. Participants illustrated the organizational, public health, and regional information they considered essential (e.g., hospital census, community positivity rate, etc.). Participants named specific challenges they faced due to data quality and timeliness. Participants elaborated on the necessity of data integration, validation, and coordination across different boundaries (e.g., different hospital systems in the same metro areas, public health agencies at the local, state, and federal level, etc.). Participants indicated that even within the first 6 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic, the data and tools used for making critical decisions changed. Discussion. While existing medical informatics infrastructure can facilitate decision making in pandemic response, data may not always be readily available in a usable format. Interoperable infrastructure and data standardization across multiple health systems would help provide more reliable and timely information for decision making. Conclusion. Our findings contribute to future discussions of improving data infrastructure and developing harmonized data standards needed to facilitate critical decisions at multiple health care system levels.

Because racial disparities in food access, obesity, and access to treatment for disordered eating exist, it is important to examine these relationships in Black populations. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of American Life (N = 4553), a nationally-representative sample of Black Americans, including African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans. Logistic regression was used to explore the association of food insufficiency with obesity and binge eating. RESULTS: In the total sample of Black Americans, the prevalence of food insufficiency was 10.9% (95% CI 10.0C11.8%). Food insufficiency was not significantly associated with obesity in Black Americans, but when associations were explored in analyses stratified by ethnicity and sex, food insufficiency significantly predicted an increased odds of obesity in Afro-Caribbeans (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.01, 2.13). Individuals experiencing food insufficiency were more likely to report recurrent binge eating in the last 12 months (3% v 2%, P = 0.02) and a lifetime history of binge eating (6% v 3%, P = 0.004) compared to those who were food sufficient. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, food insufficiency was not significantly associated with recurrent binge eating in Black Americans or in sex- and ethnicity-stratified analyses.

There were many studies about rheumatology and COVID-19. But there is no study about bibliometric analysis of these studies. This study provides a general overview of studies on rheumatology and COVID-19. METHODS: Data were taken from the Web of Science (WoS) website. Analysis and network visualization mapping processes were carried out using VOSviewer. We used the following keywords: COVID-19 and Rheumatology; Coronavirus and Rheumatology; 2019-nCoV and Rheumatology; SARS-CoV-2 and Rheumatology; COVID-19 and Rheumatic Disease; Coronavirus and Rheumatic Disease; 2019-nCoV and Rheumatic Disease; SARS-CoV-2 and Rheumatic Disease; COVID-19 and Rheumatism; Coronavirus and Rheumatism; 2019-nCoV and Rheumatism; and SARS-CoV-2 and Rheumatism. A total of 234 publications were analyzed, and the correlations between citation numbers and reference counts, usage counts, and page numbers were analyzed with Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The average number of citations per item was 6.03. The studies were cited 1411 times in total, and 1121 times without self-citations. The countries with the highest number of publications on rheumatology and COVID-19 were the USA and England; the countries with the highest number of citations were Italy and the USA, and Jinoos Yazdany was the most cited author. The Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases was the most cited journal, whereas the highest number of articles on rheumatology and COVID-19 were published in Arthritis and Rheumatology. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric analysis of rheumatology and COVID-19 can be useful to future studies because it provides a general perspective on the studies.

Some reports showed that subjects with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia after being discharged could have several sequelae, but there are few studies on gas exchange and exercise capacity complications in these subjects. AIMS: To describe residual gas exchange abnormalities during recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. METHODS: In an observational study, a90 d after onset of disease, we scheduled almost 200 subjects for an out-patient visit with pulmonary function testing and computed tomography of the lungs. Lung mechanics by using body plethysmography, gas exchange with diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide determined by the single-breath technique (DLCOsb) and diffusing lung capacity for nitric oxide determined by the single-breath technique (DLNOsb), and exercise ability by using the 6-min walk test (6MWT) were measured in the subjects. The results were compared between those who required invasive mechanical ventilation and those who did not. RESULTS: A total of 171 subjects were included, the majority (96%) had signs of residual pneumonia (such as an excess of high attenuation areas) on computed tomography of the lungs. The DLCOSB results were below the lower limit of the normal range in 29.2% of the subjects; during the 6MWT, 67% experienced oxygen desaturation ([Formula: see text]) > 4%; and, in 81 (47%), the dropped below 88%. Subjects who required invasive mechanical ventilation (49.7%) were more likely to have lower lung volumes, more gas exchange abnormality, less exercise capacity and more radiologic abnormality.

This study aimed to identify knowledge, attitudes, experiences, and practices regarding medical nutrition therapy and barriers and facilitators to medical nutrition therapy access for individuals with CKD stages G1-G5 from the perspective of patients and providers. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study composed of anonymous surveys. SETTING & POPULATION: Adults with CKD stages G1-G5 and medical providers and registered dietitian nutritionists who regularly see patients with CKD stages G1-G5 were recruited by email using National Kidney Foundation and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics databases and through the National Kidney Foundation 2019 Spring Clinical Meetings mobile app. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive analyses and Fisher exact tests were conducted with Stata SE 16. RESULTS: Respondents included 348 patients, 66 registered dietitian nutritionists, and 30 medical providers. In general, patients and providers had positive perceptions of medical nutrition therapy and its potential to slow CKD progression and manage complications, and most patients reported interest in a medical nutrition therapy referral. However, there were feasibility concerns related to cost to the patient, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of renal registered dietitian nutritionists. There was low awareness of Medicare no-cost share coverage for medical nutrition therapy across patients and providers. About half the practices did not bill for medical nutrition therapy and those that did reported issues with being paid and low reimbursement rates. LIMITATIONS: Results may not be generalizable due to the small number of respondents and the potential for self-selection, nonresponse, and social desirability bias. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with CKD stages G1-G5 are interested in medical nutrition therapy and confident that it can help with disease management, but there are feasibility concerns related to cost to the patient, insurance coverage, and reimbursement. There are significant opportunities to design and test interventions to facilitate medical nutrition therapy access for patients with CKD stages G1-G5.","output":"Medical Nutrition Therapy Access in CKD: A Cross-sectional Survey of Patients and Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is frequently detected in the feces of infected individuals While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has not previously been identified in wastewater, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the feces of at least one patient, raising concerns about the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater The fate and inactivation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are unknown, with current inactivation estimates based on surrogate models In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and RNA signal was determined in water and wastewater The times for 90% reduction (T90) of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and tap water at room temperature were 1 5 and 1 7 days, respectively In high-starting titer (105 TCID50 mLC1) experiments, infectious virus persisted for the entire 7-day sampling time course In wastewater at 50 and 70 C, the observed T90 values for infectious SARS-CoV-2 were decreased to 15 and 2 min, respectively SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found to be significantly more persistent than infectious SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the environmental detection of RNA alone does not substantiate risk of infection","output":"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in Water and Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have become popular methods for financial data analysis, including financial textual data, numerical data, and graphical data.

These measures have led to a reduction of anthropogenic air pollutants, providing an opportunity to observe the contribution of human activities to local air pollution. In this study, the control period was divided into four stages:the before, early, middle, and later stages. Based on a variety of data including meteorological, traffic, and industrial manufacturing datasets, statistical methods were combined with spatial analysis to evaluate changes in air pollution and associated human impacts during each stage. In addition, suggestions are made for further regional air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Key results are as follows:a? Overall, the AQI and the concentrations of six air pollutants, especially SO2, PM10, and NO2, were lower during control period than during the equivalent period in 2019 (reductions of 26.5%, 24.3%, and 16.9%, respectively). From the before to later stages, pollutants (except O3) showed a downward trend while O3 increased significantly during the before stage (by 76.2%) and the growth rate slowed during the middle and later stages; aDuring the prior stage, Beijing experienced two periods with heavy air pollution days as a result of the local accumulation of pollutants, secondary transformation, and regional transport. The concentration of PM2.5 in February was nearly 60% lower than in February 2014 under similar meteorological conditions in Beijing; a? Following an increase in traffic volume and industrial activity, changes in air pollutants tended to be stable or slightly increase during the middle and later stages of the control period. The grey relation coefficients between thermal radiation intensity anomalies and the main pollutants in heavy industrial cities were greater than 0.6, which means that the control of industrial emissions remains key to controlling air pollution.","output":"[Analysis of Changes and Factors Influencing Air Pollutants in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region During the COVID-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in reagents, methodologies, analytic platforms, and tools have resulted in a dramatic transformation of the research pathology laboratory.

The importance of vaccination (v) during the Covid19 (CV19) pandemic has been widely discussed in the media. To ascertain the receptiveness of type 2 diabetics (T2D) to fluv during the CV19 pandemic and their acceptance of an eventual CV19 vaccine (CVv) we carried out telephone interviews with 34 unselected T2D pts in Montreal, Quebec post the 1st wave of CV19 in that region. Pts were asked if they planned taking the fluv and/or an eventual CVv, reasons for reticence to v, and attitudes toward and compliance with public health (PH) directives. They were also asked their primary source of health related information. Recent HbA1c and insulin use were recorded. Thirty four T2Ds were surveyed, 22 M 50C87 yrs (mean 69.2) and 12 F 49C84 yrs (mean 68.8). Eleven M and 5 F were on insulin. HbA1c ranged from 5.9C13.0 (mean 7.3). None of the pts had recently discussed v with a healthcare provider (HCP). One pt received his health related information from Facebook, the others from mainstream media. None had contraindications to v. None had been diagnosed with CV19. Past influenza history was unknown. Forty one percent (14/34) of pts, 11 M 50C86 yrs (mean 66.0) and 3 F 49C66 yrs (mean 59.0) did not plan to take the fluv. They explained their decisions as never having taken fluv (12 pts) or having been ill despite having taken it (2 pts). Neither accessibility nor cost were issues. Two F, 62 and 66 yrs, who refused fluv also refused CVv. Six M aged 60C86 yrs (mean 70.5) and 1 F aged 73 yrs were planning to wait to access real life safety (6pts) or efficacy (1pt) data before accepting CVv. All pts claimed to be following PH guidelines including social distancing, hand washing, and mask recommendations;91.2% (31/34) fully agreed with PH policies, 2 were in moderate agreement and 1 thought PH policy was not strict enough. Of the latter 3 pts none planned on taking the fluv. One planned taking the CVv, 1 planned not to, and the 3rd planned to wait before deciding. Despite a long history of use, recommendations by experts, and free and easy accessibility, T2D pts questioned after the 1st wave of CV19 are not convinced of the fluvs importance. Despite high case numbers and being themselves at high risk, not all T2Ds are willing to unequivocally accept a potential Health Canada sanctioned CVv.

Our global descriptive study aims to inform policymakers on factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers (HCWs) in 12 countries, based on income index. We also looked for possible predictors of vaccine acceptance among the study sample. METHODS: A structured questionnaire prepared after consultation with experts in the field and guided by the Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy was administered among 2,953 HCWs. Upon obtaining informed consent, apart from demographic information, we collected information on trust in vaccines and health authorities, and agreement to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Although 69% of the participants agreed to accept a vaccine, there was high heterogeneity in agreement between HCWs in low and lower-middle income countries (L-LMICs) and upper-middle- and high-income countries (UM-HICs), with acceptance rates of 62 and 75%, respectively. Potential predictors of vaccine acceptance included being male, 50 years of age or older, resident of an UM-HIC, updating self about COVID-19 vaccines, greater disease severity perception, greater anxiety of contracting COVID-19 and concern about side effects of vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs in L-LMICs was considerably low as compared to those from UM-HICs. The lowest vaccine acceptance rates were among HCWs from the African continent.

This study aimed to assess the fear associated with COVID-19 and to evaluate the fear of vision decrease related to the delay of treatment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients (nAMD) during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cross-sectional study of 160 actively treated patients with nAMD enrolled between September and November 2020 at a tertiary hospital in Qubec, Canada. For each participant, demographic and clinical data were collected. The anxiety was rated in a questionnaire composed of two sections: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and eight additional questions to assess ophthalmology-related COVID-19 statements. RESULTS: The mean  standard deviation level of FCV-19S was 17.054.38. In the multivariable analysis, it was significantly higher in women (p<0.001) and lower in patients with a high school education vs elementary school (p=0.009). In the ophthalmology-related statements, 16% feared vision loss because of difficulties in maintaining regular follow-ups during the pandemic. The female gender was significantly associated with a higher tendency to postpone their appointment (p=0.03). No association was found between the patients underlying disease characteristics and higher fear of vision loss. CONCLUSION: Despite the massive impact of the pandemic, anxiety related to COVID-19 and delaying ophthalmology treatments remained relatively low in nAMD patients. Greater explanations to address this fear may reduce anxiety level, especially among female patients and those with an elementary school education.","output":"Fear Associated with COVID-19 in Patients with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increased engagement of adolescents in martial arts exposes them to a relatively high risk of experiencing orofacial injuries. We evaluated self-reported experience of orofacial injuries, preventive practice, and knowledge of management of sport-related orofacial injuries and related factors in adolescent Karate and Taekwondo athletes in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on Iranian martial arts athletes including Karate and Taekwondo aged 11C17-year-old in 2020 via an online questionnaire. The anonymous self-administrated questionnaire had four parts: background (age, gender, duration of sports activity, training sessions per week, and previous education on orofacial injury); self-reported experience of orofacial injury; preventive practice including mouthguard and helmet use; and knowledge of emergency management of orofacial injuries. Preventive practice and knowledge scores were calculated by summing up the scores of corresponding questions (possibly range 0C7). A linear regression model and the Pearson correlation served for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Totally, 295 athletes with a mean age of 14.56  1.91 years participated in the study. A quarter (n = 74, 25.1%) of athletes stated that they had received training on prevention of orofacial injuries. Only 3.7% (n = 11) of the participants reported the use of custom-made mouthguards, and 62% (n = 183) reported a positive history of orofacial injuries. A significant relationship existed between self-reported orofacial injury and age ( = ? 0.32, p < 0.001), hours of training per week ( = 0.12, p = 0.037), type of sport ( = 0.11, p = 0.049), and previous training on orofacial injuries ( = ? 0.14, p = 0.010). No difference existed in the history of orofacial injury between females (n = 114) and males (n = 69) (p = 0.374). The mean score of self-reported preventive practice and knowledge of management of orofacial injuries was 3.53  1.82 (out of 7) and 1.67  1.10 (out of 7), respectively.
