The effect was sustained, and further reduction of the nodules occurred after the third vaccine dose. One of the reduced nodules was removed, histologically examined, and its histopathology was compared to that of another such nodule removed and examined earlier.

Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomain subunits with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titer at two weeks post immunization, which is significantly higher than titer induced by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented at two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results show that vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage (lung and nares) for protected animals, compared with ~10% weight loss, higher viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data show that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37C for at least 4 weeks.

The ongoing DAPASALT mechanistic clinical study will evaluate natriuretic, diuretic, plasma/extracellular volume and blood pressure responses to dapagliflozin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with normal or impaired renal function (D-NRF and D-IRF, respectively), and in normoglycemic individuals with renal impairment (N-IRF). In this study, a mathematical model of renal physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology was used to prospectively predict changes in sodium excretion, blood and interstitial fluid volume (IFV), blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria in DAPASALT. After validating the model with previous diabetic nephropathy trials, virtual patients were matched to DAPASALT inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the DAPASALT protocol was simulated. Predicted changes in glycosuria, blood pressure, GFR, and albuminuria were consistent with other recent studies in similar populations. Predicted albuminuria reductions were 46% in D-NRF, 34.8% in D-IRF, and 14.2% in N-IRF. The model predicts similarly large IFV reduction between D-NRF and D-IRF, and less but still substantial IFV reduction in N-IRF, even though glycosuria attenuated in groups with impaired renal function. When DAPASALT results become available, comparison with these simulations will provide a basis for evaluating how well we understand the cardiorenal mechanism(s) of SGLT2i. Meanwhile, these simulations link dapagliflozin's renal mechanisms to changes in IFV and renal biomarkers, suggesting these benefits may extend to those with impaired renal function and nondiabetics.

METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted in the contralateral lung before staging bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy and immediately after lung resection. Blood and exhaled nitric oxide were sampled preoperatively and at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Forty patients were included (26 VATS and 14 thoracotomy). There was a lower systemic cytokine response from lung resection undertaken by VATS compared with thoracotomy [interleukin 6 (IL-6), analysis of variance (ANOVA) P = 0.026; IL-8, ANOVA P = 0.018; and IL-10, ANOVA P = 0.047]. The VATS patients had higher perioperative serum albumin levels (ANOVA P = 0.001). Lower levels of IL-10 were produced by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes from the VATS patients compared with the thoracotomy patients at 6 hours postoperatively (geometric mean ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.33; P = 0.011). No statistically significant differences in the neutrophil phagocytic capacity, overall leukocyte count, or differential leukocyte count were found between the surgical groups (ANOVA P > 0.05).

Internet search volumes are useful data that can sensitively detect trends of the public's attention during a pandemic outbreak situation. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyze the public's interest in COVID-19 proliferation, identify the correlation between the proliferation of COVID-19 and interest in immunity and products that have been reported to confer an enhancement of immunity, and suggest measures for interventions that should be implemented from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious diseases during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we extracted Google search data from January 20, 2020, onward and compared them to data from March 15, 2020, which was approximately 2 months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected coronavirus, immune, and vitamin as our final search terms. RESULTS: The increase in the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases that occurred after January 20, 2020, had a strong positive correlation with the search volumes for the terms coronavirus (R=0.786; P<.001), immune (R=0.745; P<.001), and vitamin (R=0.778; P<.001), and the correlations between variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country basis when we restricted our analyses to the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for the terms coronavirus and immune preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions of strengthening their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic, social media platforms have a high potential for informing the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity, thereby increasing the public's knowledge.","output":"Public Interest in Immunity and the Justification for Intervention in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of Google Trends Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many challenges exist in providing equitable access to rural healthcare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). WHO recommends student exposure to rural clinical rotations to promote interest in rural healthcare. Challenges to rural engagement include lack of adequate infrastructure and staff to lead rural education. This case report highlights key steps in developing a rural rotation program for DRC nursing students. Case presentation To implement a rural rotation (RR) program, ICAP at Columbia University (ICAP) consulted with students, the Ministries of Health (MoH) and Education (MoE), and nursing schools to pilot and expand a rural rotation program. Nursing schools agreed to place students in rural clinics and communities. Key stakeholders collaborated to assess and select rural sites based on availability of nursing mentors, educational resources, security, accessibility, and patient volume. To support this, 85 preceptors from 55 target schools and 30 rural health facilities were trained of which 30 were selected to be master trainers. These master trainers led the remaining 55 preceptors implementing the rural rotation program. We worked with rural facilities to engage community leaders and secure accommodation for students. A total of 583 students from five Lubumbashi schools and two rural schools outside Kinshasa participated across 16 rural sites (298 students in 2018C2019 school year and 285 in 2019C2020). Feedback from 274 students and 25 preceptors and nursing school leaders was positive with many students actively seeking rural assignments upon graduation. For example, 97% agreed or strongly agreed that their RR programs had strengthened their educational experience. Key challenges, however, were long-term financial support (35%) for rural rotations, adequate student housing (30%) and advocacy for expanding the rural workforce. CONCLUSIONS: With nearly 600 participants, this project showed that a RR program is feasible and acceptable in resource-limited settings yet availability of ample student accommodation and increasing availability of rural jobs remain health system challenges. Using a multipronged approach to rural health investment as outlined by WHO over two decades ago remains essential.

AIM: In this work, we analyse an outbreak of COVID-19 in a University hospital in Cairo involving HCWs of different categories, patients and patients accompanying relatives. METHODS: Following the reporting of the first COVID-19 confirmed case; a 55-year-old nurse at the hospital, a total of 645 healthcare workers, patients and patients accompanying relatives were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 589 HCWs, 3 out of 42 patient and 4 out of 14 patients accompanying relatives tested positive for COVID-19. No physicians, pharmacists or technicians were infected. Nursing staff and housekeeping staff were the most at risk of contracting the infection with a risk ratio of 4.99 (95% CI: 1.4-17.6) and 5.08 (95% CI: 1.4-18.4) respectively.

Chronic hemodialysis makes social distancing difficult to achieve. Alternatively, kidney transplantation could increase the severity of COVID-19 due to therapeutic immunosuppression and contribute to saturation of intensive care units. For these reasons, kidney transplantation was suspended in France during the first epidemic wave. Here, we retrospectively evaluated this strategy by comparing the overall and COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant recipients and candidates over the last three years. Cross-interrogation of two national registries for the period 1 March and 1 June 2020, identified 275 deaths among the 42812 kidney transplant recipients and 144 deaths among the 16210 candidates. This represents an excess of deaths for both populations, as compared with the same period the two previous years. This difference was integrally explained by COVID-19, which caused the death of 44% of recipients and 42% of candidates. Taking into account the size of the two populations and the geographical heterogeneity of virus circulation, we found that the excess of risk of death due to COVID-19 was similar for recipients and candidates in high viral risk area but four-fold higher for candidates in the low viral risk area. Thus, in case of a second epidemic wave, kidney transplantation should be suspended in high viral risk areas but maintained outside those areas, both to reduce the excess of deaths of candidates and avoid wasting precious resources.","output":"IMPact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the moRTAlity of kidney transplant recipients and candidates in a French Nationwide registry sTudy (IMPORTANT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The life of medical specialists worldwide has dramatically changed due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic Healthcare professionals (HCP) have personally faced the outbreak being on the first line of the battlefield with the disease and as such present a significant part of all diseased with Covid-19 We propose a classification, we discuss the pathophysiology, the clinical findings, and the ways of treatment and prevention of occupational skin hazards in HCP The multivariate pattern of occupational skin diseases during the Covid-19 pandemic can be classified into four subgroups: mechanical skin injury, moisture-associated skin damage, contact reactions and exacerbation of pre-existing dermatoses The clinical pattern is versatile, and the most affected skin sites were the ones in contact with the protective equipment Dermatologists should recognize the plethora of occupational skin reactions in the Covid-19 pandemic and implement treatment and preventive strategies in times of pandemic","output":"Prevention and Occupational Hazards for The Skin During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of infection create unique challenges to healthcare leaders and members of infection control teams who lead efforts to manage, control and resolve outbreaks.

Prescriptions have increased in Europe in the last decade, although remain lower than in USA. This work projected the future utilization and costs of opioids in chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). METHODS: An epidemiological model was populated with the opioid dispensing trends from 2010 to 2019 using Spanish Medicinal Agency rates of opioid utilization in subjects over 18 years of age and the real-world OPIOIDS study to estimate chronic-OA-pain patients receiving opioids. A best-fitted trend analysis model was applied estimating the likely number of DHD (defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants per day) to calculate projected opioid utilization and costs for the period 2020C2029. RESULTS: In 2010, an estimated 5.67 DHD were dispensed for the equivalent of 217,076 chronic OA pain patients per day [1.99 DHD, 76,084 refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)]. From these trends and OA prevalence, the projected number of DHDs is expected to increase more than threefold to 17.98 DHDs by the year 2029 for the equivalent of 727,356 chronic OA pain patients per day (8.18 DHD, 330,720 refractory to NSAIDs); 41.8% on strong opioids. The estimated cost was 116.9m (45.0m in NSAID-refractory OA) in 2010 rising by 222% to 376.1m (199.7m refractory to NSAIDs) by 2029. CONCLUSION: Chronic-OA-pain-related opioid dispensing and costs to the NHS are set to increase more than threefold from 2010 to 2029 in Spain. Using opioids for OA pain is concerning given disease chronicity and other related costs not computed in these projections. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: ? Opioids are widely used in chronic pain which is non-responsive to standard analgesics. Prescriptions have increased in Europe, although remain lower than in USA. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease usually accompanied by pain. Despite not recommended, opioids use in OA have been expanded because this health condition is increasing with ageing and, also, because physicians both primary and specialist boosted their use. ? This study aimed to quantify the current burden of opioids used for chronic moderate-to-severe OA pain by estimating the number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD) and associated costs, and to forecast the likely burden on the National Health System (NHS) in Spain for the years 2020C2029. ? In 2010, an estimated 5.67 DHDs were dispensed for the equivalent of 217,076 chronic OA pain patients per day. From these trends, the projected number of DHDs is expected to increase more than threefold to 17.98 DHDs by the year 2029 for the equivalent of 727,356 chronic OA pain patients per day; 41.8% on strong opioids. The estimated cost was 116.9m in 2010 rising by 222% to 376.1m by 2029. ? Chronic OA-pain-related opioid dispensing and costs to the NHS are set to increase substantially (threefold to more than fourfold) from 2010 to 2029 in Spain. Thus, using opioids for OA pain is concerning given disease chronicity, aging population and other related costs not computed in these projections. Our findings can inform payors and clinicians about ongoing discussions on appropriate analgesic management for longer-term OA pain, including resource requirements at a national level. Clinicians who prescribe opioids for OA pain should consider the potential implications of side effects such as sedation, cognitive deterioration, incremental need of caregivers, particularly in older people, and carefully consider the riskCbenefit balance.","output":"Future projections of opioid use and cost in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Liver injury is commonly seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Patients with liver injury were more likely to be male (71.6% vs 37.3%; p < 0.001). Peak inflammatory markers and IL-6 were higher in the liver injury group: CRP: 247 vs 168 mg/L, p < 0.001; LDH: 706 vs 421 U/L, ferritin: 2,973 vs 751 ng/mL, p < 0.001, IL-6: 121.0 vs 71.8, p < 0.001.

Embedded in the Project of Sino-Greece Online Chinese Language Classrooms, this study employed narrative inquiry and case study as methodological approaches. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data that consisted of written narratives (the teacher's teaching journals and reflections, field notes of teaching assistant, and emails of students) and spoken narratives. Three research questions guided this study: What are the teacher's beliefs about (1) the opportunity of teaching CFL online? (2) the management of this online project? (3) her personal capability to foster students' engagement in this project? These three questions focused, respectively, on the three components of the self-efficacy system of a teacher (personal efficacy, efficacy within the organization, and professional efficacy). Findings illustrated that the efficacy beliefs of the teacher in these three aspects were at different levels, which resulted from the interplay of external and internal factors; when external factors appeared to be negative, internal factors seemed to play an essential role.","output":"Teacher Engagement in Language Teaching: Investigating Self-Efficacy for Teaching Based on the Project Sino-Greece Online Chinese Language Classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate the effect of mass media coverage of the meningococcal disease on the uptake of meningococcal vaccinations in Hungary.

Investigating the publics response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policy makers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions. OBJECTIVE: Using data from social media, this infoveillance study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (eg, business and school closures, regional lockdown differences, and additional public health restrictions, such as social distancing and masking). METHODS: COVID-19Crelated tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 and October 31, 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites. Dynamic regression models with autoregressive integrated moving average errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (ie, collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement), controlling for the effects of confounders (ie, daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, and COVID-19Crelated official updates). RESULTS: In addition to expected direct effects (eg, business closures led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restrictions on public opinion was contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closures and other restrictions (eg, masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (ie, sentiment polarization). Partial (ie, region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (ie, higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information can help public health practitioners and policy makers anticipate public response to future pandemic restrictions and ensure adequate resources are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but controversial, restrictions.","output":"Changes in Public Response Associated With Various COVID-19 Restrictions in Ontario, Canada: Observational Infoveillance Study Using Social Media Time Series Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS About 15% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) express fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins (FFs), most often in concert with mutational inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A or BAP1. In FFs, FGFR2 residues 1-768 are fused to sequences encoded by a diverse array of partner genes (>60), a configuration that causes oncogenic FF activation. While FGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (F-TKI) provide clinical benefit in FF+ iCCA, responses are partial and/or limited by resistance mechanisms, including FF tyrosine kinase domain mutations, such as the V565F substitution in the FGFR2 gatekeeper residue. Improving on FF targeting in iCCA therefore remains a critical and unmet need. Herein, we present the generation of FF-driven murine iCCA models and their exploitation for discovering actionable FF-associated dependencies. METHODS Four iCCA FFs carrying different fusion sequences were expressed in Tp53-/- mouse liver organoids. Tumorigenic properties of genetically modified liver organoids were assessed by transplantation in immuno-deficient mice. Cellular models derived from neoplastic lesions were exploited for pre-clinical studies. RESULTS Transplantation of FF-expressing liver organoids yielded tumors diagnosed as CCA based on histological, phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses. The penetrance of this tumorigenic phenotype was influenced by FF identity. Tumor organoids and 2D cell lines derived from CCA lesions were addicted to FF signaling via Ras-Erk, regardless of FF identity or V565F mutation. Dual blockade of FF and Ras-Erk pathway by concomitant pharmacological inhibition of FFs and Mek1/2 provided greater therapeutic efficacy than single agent F-TKI in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS FF-driven iCCA pathogenesis was successfully modeled in murine Tp53-/-background, revealing biological heterogeneity among structurally different FFs. Double blockade of FF-Erk signaling deserves consideration for precision-based approaches against human FF+ iCCA. LAY SUMMARY Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a difficult-to-treat rare type of cancer. A subtype of iCCA is caused by genomic alterations that generate oncogenic drivers known as FGFR2 fusions. CCA patients with FGFR2 fusions respond to FGFR inhibitors, but clinical responses are often of modest duration. We generated animal and cellular models of iCCA driven by FGFR2 fusions, which showed sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. In addition, we showed that FGFR2 fusions require the activity of a downstream effector named Mek1/2. We found that dual blockade of FGFR2 fusions and Mek1/2 in iCCA was more effective than isolated inhibition of FGR2 fusions, pointing to potential clinical utility of dual FGFR2-MEK1/2 blockade.","output":"FGFR2 fusion proteins drive oncogenic transformation of mouse liver organoids towards cholangiocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the tourism market worldwide.

Participants (N = 1770; 80% female, median age 45 years, median body mass index 47 kg/m) self-reported smoking history pre-surgery, and current smoking behavior annually. RESULTS Almost half of participants (45.2%) reported a pre-surgery history of smoking. Modeled prevalence of current smoking decreased in the year before surgery from 13.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1-15.4] to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.5-2.9) at surgery, then increased to 9.6% (95% CI = 8.1-11.2) 1-year post-surgery and continued to increase to 14.0% (95% CI = 11.8-16.0) 7-years post-surgery. Among smokers, mean packs/day was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.77) at surgery, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62-0.78) 1-year post-surgery and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68-0.88) 7-years post-surgery. At 7-years, smoking was reported by 61.7% (95% CI = 51.9-70.8) of participants who smoked 1-year pre-surgery (n = 221), 12.3% (95% CI = 8.5-15.7) of participants who formerly smoked but quit >1 year pre-surgery (n = 507), and 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-4.9) of participants who reported no smoking history (n = 887). Along with smoking history (ie, less time since smoked), younger age, household income <$25,000, being married or living as married, and illicit drug use were independently associated with increased risk of post-surgery smoking. CONCLUSION Although most adults who smoked 1-year before RYGB quit pre-surgery, smoking prevalence rebounded across 7-years, primarily due to relapse.","output":"Changes in Smoking Behavior Before and After Gastric Bypass: A 7-year Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 has negatively impacted the mental health of frontline health care workers, including pharmacists. Objective(s) The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists. Methods We carried out a postal-based survey to assess the psychological difficulties of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists based on three psychologically validated self-report questionnaires: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R) and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The baseline assessment was during the first sanitary lockdown period and the second one 5 months later. Results The sample consists of 135 owner community pharmacists. At follow-up, 67 answered the questionnaires (response rate: 49.6%). The mean scores of the PSS and IES-R significantly decreased (p=0.002).

In response, we created a remote-learning model that can be broadly adapted for other SSPs. We aimed to uphold our traditional SSPs academic rigor by cultivating critical thinking skills, providing mentorship, and equipping students with tools to serve as public health ambassadors in their communities. We designed the remote SSP around an anchor topic to integrate didactic lectures with research-based independent projects. Program success was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively via content assessments and written feedback. By comparing preassessments to postassessments, we show that students gained general scientific literacy and improved critical thinking skills. Based on qualitative measures, students were satisfied with their mentorship, reported that they would use what they learned through the SSP in the future, indicated that they had the tools to understand and communicate public health information, and, overall, rated the quality of the SSP positively.

Because periodontal treatment reduces inflammation in oral tissues, some hypothesize it may positively affect systemic outcomes by reducing inflammation in the body. A significant number of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) have evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic outcomes. However, inconsistent findings and questionable methodological rigor make drawing conclusions difficult. We conducted a systematic review of reviews that studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment on systemic disease outcomes. We report on outcomes evaluated, categorizing them as biomarkers, and surrogate or clinical endpoints. In addition, we used A MeaSurement Tool to Access systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) to evaluate the methodological quality of the reviews. Of the 52 studies included in our review, 21 focused on diabetes, 15 on adverse birth outcomes, 8 on cardiovascular disease, 3 each on obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, and 2 on chronic kidney disease. Across all studies, surrogate endpoints predominated as outcomes, followed by biomarkers and, rarely, actual disease endpoints.

In this study we report on the triphasic nature of the relationship between plant water potential () at predawn and midday and describe a method that predicts  at stomatal closure and turgor loss exclusively from this water potential (WP) curve. The method is based on a piecewise linear regression model that was developed to predict the boundaries (termed O1 and O2) separating the three phases of the curve and corresponding slope values. The method was tested for three economically important woody species. For all species, midday  was much more negative than predawn  during phase I (mild drought), reductions in midday  were minor while predawn  continued to decline during phase II (moderate drought), and midday and predawn  reached similar values during phase-III (severe drought).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to characterize the response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients with lymphoid malignancies or those undergoing anti-CD20 antibody therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search retrieved 52 relevant articles, and random-effect models were used to analyze humoral and cellular responses. RESULTS: Lymphoid malignancies and anti-CD20 antibody therapy for non-malignancies were significantly associated with lower seropositivity rates (risk ratio [RR] 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53C0.69]; RR 0.45 [95% CI 0.39C0.52], respectively). Some subtypes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], treatment-na?ve CLL, myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) exhibited impaired humoral response. Anti-CD20 antibody therapy within 6 months of vaccination decreased humoral response; moreover, therapy > 12 months before vaccination still impaired the humoral response. However, anti-CD20 antibody therapy in non-malignant patients did not attenuate T cell responses. CONCLUSION: : These data suggest that patients with lymphoid malignancies or those undergoing anti-CD20 antibody therapy experience an impaired humoral response, but cellular response can be detected independent of anti-CD20 antibody therapy. Studies with long-term follow-up of vaccine effectiveness are warranted (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021265780).

They are the source of most antimicrobials of bacterial origin utilized in medicine today. Their genomes are among the richest in novel secondary metabolites with high biotechnological potential. Actinobacteria reveal complex patterns of evolution, responses, and adaptations to their environment, which are not yet well understood. We analyzed three novel plant isolates and explored their habitat adaptation, evolutionary patterns, and potential secondary metabolite production. The phylogenomically characterized isolates belonged to Actinoplanes sp. TFC3, Streptomyces sp. L06, and Embleya sp. NF3. Positively selected genes, relevant in strain evolution, encoded enzymes for stress resistance in all strains, including porphyrin, chlorophyll, and ubiquinone biosynthesis in Embleya sp. NF3. Streptomyces sp. L06 encoded for pantothenate and proteins for CoA biosynthesis with evidence of positive selection; furthermore, Actinoplanes sp. TFC3 encoded for a c-di-GMP synthetase, with adaptive mutations. Notably, the genomes harbored many genes involved in the biosynthesis of at least ten novel secondary metabolites, with many avenues for future new bioactive compound characterization-specifically, Streptomyces sp. L06 could make new ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, while Embleya sp. NF3 could produce new non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. At the same time, TFC3 has particularly enriched in terpene and polyketide synthases. All the strains harbored conserved genes in response to diverse environmental stresses, plant growth promotion factors, and degradation of various carbohydrates, which supported their endophytic lifestyle and showed their capacity to colonize other niches. This study aims to provide a comprehensive estimation of the genomic features of novel Actinobacteria. It sets the groundwork for future research into experimental tests with new bioactive metabolites with potential application in medicine, biofertilizers, and plant biomass residue utilization, with potential application in medicine, as biofertilizers and in plant biomass residues utilization.

A significant hurdle during cancer treatment is the occurrence of intrinsic and acquired therapeutic resistance. This latter case emphasizes the need for new drugs to overcome the challenges resulting from the current therapy. Considering that every drug has at least six off-targets, which might be relevant in cancer therapy, makes drug repurposing an excellent mean to speed up access to new therapeutic options. This review aims to thoroughly discuss anti-microbial agents currently in different trials or those evaluated in pre-clinical settings against various types of cancer and provide an overview of the mechanism(s) by which these agents exert their effects. ABSTRACT: The substantial costs of clinical trials, the lengthy timelines of new drug discovery and development, along the high attrition rates underscore the need for alternative strategies for finding quickly suitable therapeutics agents. Given that most approved drugs possess more than one target tightly linked to other diseases, it encourages promptly testing these drugs in patients. Over the past decades, this has led to considerable attention for drug repurposing, which relies on identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs outside the scope of the original medical indication. The known safety of approved drugs minimizes the possibility of failure for adverse toxicology, making them attractive de-risked compounds for new applications with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. This latter case is an exciting opportunity, specifically in oncology, due to increased resistance towards the current therapies. Indeed, a large body of evidence shows that a wealth of non-cancer drugs has beneficial effects against cancer. Interestingly, 335 drugs are currently being evaluated in different clinical trials for their potential activities against various cancers (Redo database).

To alleviate the pressure on the PCR testing capacity, many provinces implemented new strategies that promote self testing and adjust the eligibility for PCR tests, making the count of new cases underreported. We designed a novel compartmental model which captures the new testing guidelines, social behaviours, booster vaccines campaign and features of the newest variant Omicron. To better describe the testing eligibility, we considered the population divided into high risk and non-high-risk settings. The model is calibrated using data from January 1 to February 9, 2022, on cases and severe outcomes in Canada, the province of Ontario and City of Toronto. We conducted analyses on the impact of PCR testing capacity, self testing, different level of reopening and vaccination coverage on cases and severe outcomes. Our results show that the total number of cases in Canada, Ontario and Toronto are 2.34 (95%CI: 1.22C3.38), 2.20 (95%CI: 1.15C3.72), and 1.97(95%CI: 1.13C3.41), times larger than reported cases, respectively. The current testing strategy is efficient if partial restrictions, such as limited capacity in public spaces, are implemented. Allowing more people to have access to PCR reduces the daily cases and severe outcomes; however, if PCR test capacity is insufficient, then it is important to promote self testing. Also, we found that reopening to a pre-pandemic level will lead to a resurgence of the infections, peaking in late March or April 2022. Vaccination and adherence to isolation protocols are an important support to the testing policies to mitigate any possible spread of the virus.","output":"Projections of the transmission of the Omicron variant for Toronto, Ontario, and Canada using surveillance data following recent changes in testing policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Historically, pandemics have resulted in higher mortality rates in the most vulnerable populations.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between SDH and COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study, where data from patients with COVID-19 were collected at a public hospital in Chile. Sociodemographic variables related to structural SDH were classified according to the following categories: gender, age (< 65 years,  65 years), secondary education (completed or not), work status (active, inactive) and income (< USD 320,  USD 320). RESULTS: A total of 1,012 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Average age was 64.2  17.5 years. Mortality of the entire sample was 14.5 %. Age, level of education, unemployment and income had a strong association with mortality (p < 0.001).

ResultsIn previously infected individuals, AB were more durable and robust following vaccination when compared to natural infection alone. Higher AB were associated with experiencing dyspnea during natural infection, as was the total number of symptoms reported during the COVID-19 disease course. Both local and systemic symptoms following 1st and 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were predictive of higher AB after vaccination, as were the demographic factors of age and Hispanic ethnicity. Lastly, there was a significant temporal relationship between AB and days since infection or vaccination. ConclusionVaccination in COVID+ individuals ensures a more robust immune response. Experiencing systemic and local symptoms post-vaccine is suggestive of higher AB, which may confer greater protection.

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes of 24 COVID-19 pregnant patients and their newborns referred to the Al-Zahra tertiary maternity hospital in Tabriz, Iran. METHODS: Clinical records of 24 COVID-19 confirmed pregnant patients were retrospectively reviewed from10 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. Vertical transition was assessed through neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. The study has been approved by the Tabriz University Medical Ethics Committee (IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.497). RESULTS: There were 24 hospitalized cases with clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The mean age of cases was 26.5 years; most were nulliparous (54.2%), in their third trimester (62.5%) and were in the type A blood group. Clinical symptoms in order of prevalence were cough, fever, dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, and diarrhea. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) in 70.8% cases was in the normal range (greater than 93%). The risk of premature labor or abortion in cases showed no increase. 12 cases were in ongoing normal status; on follow up, 11 cases had delivered their babies at term and one had ended in IUFD because of pregnancy-induced hypertension. All delivered babies were healthy. Caesarean section in all cases was performed under obstetric indications or maternal demand, and no relation was found between COVID-19 and Caesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes according to gestational age in 8 cases out of 11 (72.72%) were desirable; neonatal morbidity and mortality resulted from pregnancy complications. Blood pH in 6 neonates was assessed due to immaturity and NICU admission, all of which were in normal ranges except one case related to HELLP syndrome. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical symptoms in pregnancy were similar to non-pregnant women, no rise in risk of premature labor or abortion was seen, and vertical transmission was not observed in none of cases. Lymphopenia was the leading laboratory change. Given asymptomatic cases despite severe forms of infection in pregnancies, we propose screening in all suspected cases.

A weak immune system increases susceptibility to infections and allows infections to become more severe. One component of the immune response is inflammation. Where inflammation is excessive or uncontrolled it can damage host tissues and cause pathology. Limitation of oxidative stress is one means of controlling inflammation. Citrus fruit juices are a particularly good source of vitamin C and folate, which both have roles in sustaining the integrity of immunological barriers and in supporting the function of many types of immune cell including phagocytes, natural killer cells, T-cells and B-cells. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and reduces aspects of the inflammatory response. Important bioactive polyphenols in citrus fruit juices include hesperidin, narirutin and naringin. Hesperidin is a glycoside of hesperetin while narirutin and naringin are glycosides of naringenin. Hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and narirutin have all been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in model systems, and human trials of hesperidin report reductions in inflammatory markers. In humans, orange juice was shown to limit the post-prandial inflammation induced by a high fat-high carbohydrate meal. Consuming orange juice daily for a period of weeks has been reported to reduce markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, as confirmed through a recent meta-analysis. A newly emerging topic is whether polyphenols from orange juice have direct anti-viral effects. In summary, micronutrients and other bioactives present in citrus fruit juices have established roles in controlling oxidative stress and inflammation and in supporting innate and acquired immune responses. Trials in humans demonstrate that orange juice reduces inflammation; its effects on innate and acquired immunity require further exploration in well-designed trials in appropriate population sub-groups such as older people.","output":"Effects of Citrus Fruit Juices and Their Bioactive Components on Inflammation and Immunity: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the relationship between sentiment and the realized volatility of returns for different asset classes (stocks, bonds, foreign currency, and commodities).

Second, can sentiment be used to forecast volatility during crises? Using two nonparametric methods, mutual information and transfer entropy, we find that information sharing and transfer increased during the pandemic. We also find that sentiment information transfer to the volatility of assets differed between the GFC and the COVID\\\\19 crisis. Since sentiment can reduce uncertainty around the realized variance of assets, we investigate the forecasting ability of sentiment during crises. We find that sentiment has a greater predictive power on realized volatility during crises, with a differential impact on volatility depending on the asset class.

However, research into PC and unhealthy food choice, a key health behaviour, still remains relatively unexplored. In the current pilot investigation, 284 participants were recruited to take part in an online food choice paradigm before completing the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI). As a reduced availability of unhealthy snacks has been shown to improve snack choice, participants were randomly allocated to either an even condition (a 3:3 ratio of &#8804;99 kcal and &#8805;199 kcal snacks) or an uneven condition (a 4:2 ratio in favour of &#8804;99 kcal snacks). It was hypothesized that higher levels of PC may predict greater instances of poorer snack choices across, or even within, this paradigm. Despite an increase availability of lower calorie snacks leading to a healthier snack choice, both state and trait PC measures did not significantly influence snack choice irrespective of this varying availability. Although, marginal trends were found for higher state PC and higher calorie crisp selections. The current pilot therefore adds to the growing literature advocating for the use of behavioural economic tactics to engender healthier food choices, yet further work is needed to unpick the mediating role of PC (and its components) in snack consumption paradigms.","output":"Perseverative Cognition and Snack Choice: An Online Pilot Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aqueous extract of scraped coconut kernel is known as coconut milk.

When these factors overlap with drivers of extinction risk, such as insular distributions, the number of threatened species in a region or clade may be underestimated, a situation we term cryptic extinction risk. The genus Lepidodactylus is a diverse radiation of insular and arboreal geckos that occurs across the western Pacific. Previous work on Lepidodactylus showed evidence of evolutionary displacement around continental fringes, suggesting an inherent vulnerability to extinction from factors such as competition and predation. We sought to (1) comprehensively review status and threats, (2) estimate the number of undescribed species, and (3) estimate extinction risk in data deficient and candidate species, in Lepidodactylus. From our updated IUCN Red List assessment, 60% of the 58 recognized species are threatened (n = 15) or Data Deficient (n = 21), which is higher than reported for most other lizard groups. Species from the smaller and isolated Pacific islands are of greatest conservation concern, with most either threatened or Data Deficient, and all particularly vulnerable to invasive species. We estimated 32 undescribed candidate species and linear modelling predicted that an additional 18 species, among these and the data deficient species, are threatened with extinction. Focusing efforts to resolve the taxonomy and conservation status of key taxa, especially on small islands in the Pacific, is a high priority for conserving this remarkably diverse, yet poorly understood, lizard fauna.

Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-reactive, poorly-neutralizing epitopes can lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this way, antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination are capable of contributing to enhanced disease in subsequent infections. Currently, there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease, and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. Here, we developed a nucleotide-modified mRNA vaccine encoding for the membrane and envelope structural proteins from DENV serotype 1 encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (prM/E mRNA-LNP). Vaccination of mice elicited robust antiviral immune responses comparable to viral infection with high levels of neutralizing antibody titers and antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Immunocompromised AG129 mice vaccinated with the prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine were protected from a lethal DENV challenge. Vaccination with either a wild-type vaccine, or a vaccine with mutations in the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, elicited equivalent humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine were sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge. Both vaccine constructs demonstrated serotype specific immunity with minimal serum cross-reactivity and reduced ADE compared to a live DENV1 viral infection. IMPORTANCE With 400 million worldwide infections each year, dengue is the most common vector-born viral disease. 40% of the worlds population is at risk with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. With no therapeutics available and vaccines performing sub optimally, the need for an effective dengue vaccine is urgent. Here we develop and characterize a novel mRNA vaccine encoding for the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle. Our DENV1 prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in immunocompetent mice and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge. Existing antibodies against dengue can enhance subsequent infections via antibody-dependent enhancement. Importantly our vaccine only induced serotype specific immune responses and did not induce ADE.","output":"A mRNA-LNP vaccine against Dengue Virus elicits robust, serotype-specific immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 50% of sick children are treated by private primary-level facilities, but data on patient referral processes from such facilities are limited.

We carried out 43 in-depth interviews with health workers and caretakers of sick children, purposively selected from 30 facilities, until data saturation was achieved. The issues discussed included the process of referral, challenges in referral completion and ways to improve the process. We used thematic analysis, using a combined deductive/inductive approach. The reasons for where and how to refer were shaped by the patients clinical characteristics, the caretakers ability to pay and health workers perceptions. Caretaker non-adherence to referral and inadequate communication between health facilities were the major challenges to the referral process. Suggestions for improving referrals were hinged on procedures to promote caretaker adherence to referral, including reducing waiting time and minimising the expenses incurred by caretakers.

Evaluating real-life clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients receiving the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure technology was designed to collect prospective multicenter outcomes of thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality for patients implanted with a WATCHMAN in routine daily practice. METHODS One thousand twenty patients with a WATCHMAN implant procedure were prospectively followed in 47 centers. Left atrial appendage occlusion indication was based on the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up and imaging were performed per local practice up to a median follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS Included population was old (age 73.48.9 years), at high risk for stroke (311 prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack and 153 prior hemorrhagic stroke) and bleeding (318 prior major bleeding), with CHA2DS2-VASc score 5 in 49%, hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly 3 in 40% and oral anticoagulation contraindication in 72%. During follow-up, 161 patients (16.4%) died, 22 strokes were observed (1.3/100 patient-years, 83% reduction versus historic data), and 47 major nonprocedural bleeding events (2.7/100 patient-years, 46% reduction versus historic data). Stroke and bleeding rates were consistently lower than historic data in those with prior ischemic (-76% and -41%) or hemorrhagic (-81% and 67%) stroke and prior bleeding (-85% and -30%). Lowest bleeding rates were seen in patients with early discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients with early discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy showed lower bleeding rates, while they were highest for those with prior bleeding. Device thrombus was observed in 34 patients (4.1%) and was not correlated to drug regimen during follow-up ( P=0.28). CONCLUSIONS During the complete 2-year follow-up of Evaluating Real-Life Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, patients with a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occlusion device had consistently low rates of stroke and nonprocedural bleeding, although most were contraindicated to oral anticoagulation and used only single antiplatelet therapy or nothing.

In contrast, video conferencing software such as Zoom uses custom congestion control algorithms whose fairness behavior is mostly unknown. Aggravatingly, video conferencing has recently seen a drastic increase in use - partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - and could hence negatively affect how available Internet resources are shared. In this paper, we thus investigate the flow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of Zoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to bandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in low-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware congestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these queuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing. However, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how delay and loss affect Zoom's QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the appendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be studied further.","output":"Video Conferencing and Flow-Rate Fairness: A First Look at Zoom and the Impact of Flow-Queuing AQM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite extensive and continuing research in the area of patient portals, measuring the impact of patient portals remains a convoluted process. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore what is known about patient portal evaluations and to provide recommendations for future endeavors. The focus is on mapping the measures used to assess the impact of patient portals on the dimensions of the Quadruple Aim (QA) framework and the Canada Health Infoway's Benefits Evaluation (BE) framework. METHODS A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Reporting was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted using the Ovid platform, and the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (R) ALL (including epub ahead of print, in-process, and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, and PsycINFO. CINAHL on the EBSCO platform and Web of Science were searched for studies published between March 2015 and June 2020. A systematic gray literature search was conducted using the Google search engine. Extracted data were tabulated based on a coding template developed to categorize the literature into themes and areas of interest. RESULTS A total of 96 studies were included for data extraction. The studies were categorized based on the QA dimensions, with strict adherence to the definitions for each dimension. From the patients' perspective, it was determined that most evaluations focused on benefits and barriers to access, access to test results, medication adherence, condition management, medical notes, and secure messaging. From the population perspective, the evaluations focused on the increase in population outreach, decrease in disparities related to access to care services, and improvement in quality of care. From the health care workforce perspective, the evaluations focused on the impact of patients accessing medical records, impact on workflow, impact of bidirectional secure messaging, and virtual care. From the health system perspective, the evaluations focused on decreases in no-show appointments, impact on office visits and telephone calls, impact on admission and readmission rates and emergency department visits, and impact on health care use. Overall, 77 peer-reviewed studies were mapped on the expanded version of the BE framework. The mapping was performed using subdimensions to create a more precise representation of the areas that are currently explored when studying patient portals. Most of the studies evaluated more than one subdimension. CONCLUSIONS The QA and BE frameworks provide guidance in identifying gaps in the current literature by providing a way to show how an impact was assessed. This study highlights the need to appropriately plan how the impact will be assessed and how the findings will be translated into effective adaptations.","output":"Capturing the Impact of Patient Portals Based on the Quadruple Aim and Benefits Evaluation Frameworks: Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can affect multiple organs, among which is the circulatory system.

Additionally, biophysical properties, such as deformability, were found to be changed during the infection. Based on such data, we aim to better characterize RBC functions in COVID-19. We evaluate the flow properties of RBCs in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by using in vitro microfluidic techniques and automated methods, including artificial neural networks, for an unbiased RBC analysis. We find strong flow and RBC shape impairment in COVID-19 samples and demonstrate that such changes are reversible upon suspension of COVID-19 RBCs in healthy plasma. Vice versa, healthy RBCs immediately resemble COVID-19 RBCs when suspended in COVID-19 plasma. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses allow us to detect the effect of plasma exchanges on both plasma and RBCs and demonstrate a new role of RBCs in maintaining plasma equilibria at the expense of their flow properties.

The evidence to date supports immunothrombosis as the underlying mechanism for this coagulopathy which is triggered by a hyperinflammatory response and endotheliopathy. A hypercoagulable state results from endothelial damage/activation, complement activation, platelet hyperactivity, release of Extracellular Neutrophil Traps, activation of the coagulation system and a hypofibrinolytic state. Significant cross-talk occurs between the innate/adaptive immune system, endothelium and the coagulation system. D dimer has been shown to be the most reliable predictor of disease severity, thrombosis, and overall survival.

SRSF7 binding to its premessenger RNA promotes inclusion of a poison cassette exon and transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, elevated SRSF7 levels inhibit NMD and promote translation of two protein halves, termed Split-ORFs, from the bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript. The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites. Massive SRSF7 binding to these sites and its oligomerization promote the assembly of large nuclear bodies, which sequester SRSF7 transcripts at their transcription site, preventing their export and restoring normal SRSF7 protein levels. We further show that hundreds of human and mouse NMD targets, especially RNA-binding proteins, encode potential Split-ORFs, some of which are expressed under specific cellular conditions.","output":"SRSF7 maintains its homeostasis through the expression of Split-ORFs and nuclear body assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance given to Circular Economy (CE) has further increased in the Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC) to combat the challenges of food loss and waste which could be caused by various reasons, such as poor stock management, economic behavior and also, the occurrence of COVID-19 outbreak. The transition from linear to circularity can also enable competitive sustainability from farm to fork in AFSC, which consists of different stages: farmers, food processors, food distributors, food retailers, consumers. Food loss mainly occurs in AFSC at near-farm stages (i.e., harvesting, processing) while food waste happens in AFSC at near-fork stages (i.e., retail, post-consumption). Thus, 6Rs (remanufacture, redesign, reduce, recycle, reuse, and recover) of CE principles can offer various benefits to close the loop of the wastages along with the AFSC. In this chapter, a conceptual framework for circularity in the AFSC is proposed considering the 6Rs. Furthermore, this framework also supports the Sustainable Development Goals. The applicability of the proposed framework is examined and discussed in the case of Turkey using SWOT Analysis.

Objective: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on a wide range of mental health symptoms, to identify relevant risk factors, to identify the effect of COVID-19 country impact on mental health, and to evaluate regional differences in psychological responses to COVID-19 compared to other stressful events. Method: 7034 respondents (74% female) participated in the worldwide Global Psychotrauma Screen C Cross-Cultural responses to COVID-19 study (GPS-CCC), reporting on mental health symptoms related to COVID-19 (n = 1838) or other stressful events (n = 5196) from April to November 2020. Results: Events related to COVID-19 were associated with more mental health symptoms compared to other stressful events, especially symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and dissociation. Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events. Analysis of differences across geographic regions revealed that in Latin America more mental health symptoms were reported for COVID-19 related events versus other stressful events, while the opposite pattern was seen in North America. Conclusions: The mental health impact of COVID-19-related stressors covers a wide range of symptoms and is more severe than that of other stressful events. This difference was especially apparent in Latin America.

METHODS: We obtained RNAseq profiles of 62 prospectively enrolled COVID-19 patients and 24 healthy controls (HC). We collected 23 independent studies profiling 1,855 blood samples from patients covering six viruses (influenza, RSV, HRV, Ebola, Dengue and SARS-CoV-1). We studied host whole-blood transcriptomic responses in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral infections to understand similarities and differences in host response. Gene signature threshold was absolute effect size 1, FDR  0.05%. RESULTS: Differential gene expression of COVID-19 vs HC are highly correlated with non-COVID-19 vs HC (r=0.74, p< 0.001). We discovered two gene signatures: COVID-19 vs HC (2002 genes) (COVIDsig) and non-COVID-19 vs HC (635 genes) (nonCOVIDsig). Pathway analysis of over-expressed signature genes in COVIDsig or nonCOVIDsig identified similar pathways including neutrophil activation, innate immune response, immune response to viral infection and cytokine production. Conversely, for under-expressed genes, pathways indicated repression of lymphocyte differentiation and activation (Fig1). Intersecting the two gene signatures found two genes significantly oppositely regulated (ACO1, ATL3). We derived a third gene signature using COCONUT to compare COVID-19 to non-COVID-19 viral infections (416 genes) (Fig2). Pathway analysis did not result in significant enrichment, suggesting identification of novel biology (Fig1). Statistical deconvolution of bulk transcriptomic data found M1 macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T cells and total B cells changed in the same direction across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections. Cell types that increased in COVID-19 relative to non-COVID-19 were CD56(bright) NK cells, M2 macrophages and total NK cells. Those that decreased in non-COVID-19 relative to COVID-19 were CD56(dim) NK cells & memory B cells and eosinophils (Fig3).

DESIGN: Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across nine categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. RESULTS: 3938 medRxiv preprints with an applicable data availability statement were included in our sample, of which 911 (23.1%) were categorized as describing open data. 379 (9.6%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 155 contained an applicable data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, a minority (59 (38.1%)) of these published data availability statements described open data. Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing.

Concurrently, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, complicated with S-protein mutations and other variants, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 2.5 million deaths globally. Chronic air pollution-mediated cardiopulmonary diseases have been associated with an increased incidence of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation following COVID-19 transmission. While the underlying mechanisms responsible for this association remain elusive, air pollutant-induced vascular oxidative stress and inflammatory responses have been implicated in amplifying COVID-19-mediated cytokine release and vascular thrombosis. In addition, prolonged exposure to certain types of particulate matter (PM2.5, d < 2.5 m) has also been correlated with increased lung epithelial and vascular endothelial expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors to which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S) bind for fusion and internalization into host cells. Emerging literature has linked high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection to regions with elevated levels of PM2.5, suggesting that COVID-19 lockdowns have been implicated in regional reductions in air pollutant-mediated cardiopulmonary effects.

The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations both reveal that the optimal pair of strategies contribute enormously in lowering the number of infected and dead individuals. Although zero infection is not achieved in the population, this study implies that carrying an optimal approach constitutes a major step in controlling the spread of the disease to the barest minimum that can buy time for middle and low-income countries to carry on with their vaccination strategies.","output":"Optimal Control applied to SIRD model of COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (EID) events can have devastating human, animal and environmental health impacts. The emergence of EIDs has been associated with interconnected economic, social and environmental changes. Understanding these changes is crucial for EID preparedness and subsequent prevention and control of EID events. The aim of this review is to describe tools currently available for identification, prioritization and investigation of EIDs impacting human and animal health, and how these might be integrated into a systematic approach for directing EID preparedness. Environmental scanning, foresight programmes, horizon scanning and surveillance are used to collect and assess information for rapidly responding to EIDs and to anticipate drivers of emergence for mitigating future EID impacts. Prioritization of EIDs - using transparent and repeatable methods - based on disease impacts and the importance of those impacts to decision-makers can then be used for more efficient resource allocation for prevention and control. Risk assessment and simulation modelling methods assess the likelihood of EIDs occurring, define impact and identify mitigation strategies. Each of these tools has a role to play individually; however, we propose integration of these tools into a framework that enhances the development of tactical and strategic plans for emerging risk preparedness.","output":"Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases: pathways from anticipation to action."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory infections are of major importance because of their capacity to cause of a high degree of morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations, and to rapidly spread between countries. Perhaps the best example of this global threat is the infectious disease caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has infected more than 4 million people worldwide, causing the death of 287,000 persons according to the WHO's situation report on May 13, 2020. The availability of therapeutic tools that would be used massively to prevent or mitigate the detrimental effects of emerging respiratory viruses on human health is therefore mandatory. In this regard, research from the last decade has reported the impact of the intestinal microbiota on the respiratory immunity. It was conclusively demonstrated how the variations in the intestinal microbiota affect the responses of respiratory epithelial cells and antigen presenting cells against respiratory virus attack. Moreover, the selection of specific microbial strains (immunobiotics) with the ability to modulate immunity in distal mucosal sites made possible the generation of nutritional interventions to strengthen respiratory antiviral defenses. In this article, the most important characteristics of the limited information available regarding the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 virus are revised briefly. In addition, this review summarizes the knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the improvement of respiratory antiviral defenses by beneficial immunobiotic microorganisms such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505. The ability of beneficial microorganisms to enhance type I interferons and antiviral factors in the respiratory tract, stimulate Th1 response and antibodies production, and regulate inflammation and coagulation activation during the course of viral infections reducing tissue damage and preserving lung functionally, clearly indicate the potential of immunobiotics to favorably influence the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"The Modulation of Mucosal Antiviral Immunity by Immunobiotics: Could They Offer Any Benefit in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global response to finding therapeutics for COVID\\\\19 is chaotic even if well intentioned.

Treatments for H5N1 influenza are unsatisfactory, and convalescent human plasma containing H5N1 antibodies could be an effective therapy during outbreaks and pandemics. PURPOSE To determine whether transfusion with influenza-convalescent human blood products reduced the risk for death in patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia. DATA SOURCES Manual search of English-language journals from 1918 to 1925. Citations from retrieved studies were also searched. STUDY SELECTION Published English-language studies that had at least 10 patients in the treatment group, used convalescent blood products to treat Spanish influenza pneumonia in a hospital setting, and reported on a control or comparison group. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, adverse events, and quality. DATA SYNTHESIS Eight relevant studies involving 1703 patients were found. Treated patients, who were often selected because of more severe illness, were compared with untreated controls with influenza pneumonia in the same hospital or ward. The overall crude case-fatality rate was 16% (54 of 336) among treated patients and 37% (452 of 1219) among controls. The range of absolute risk differences in mortality between the treatment and control groups was 8% to 26% (pooled risk difference, 21% [95% CI, 15% to 27%]). The overall crude case-fatality rate was 19% (28 of 148) among patients who received early treatment (after <4 days of pneumonia complications) and 59% (49 of 83) among patients who received late treatment (after > or =4 days of pneumonia complications). The range of absolute risk differences in mortality between the early treatment group and the late treatment group was 26% to 50% (pooled risk difference, 41% [CI, 29% to 54%]). Adverse effects included chill reactions and possible exacerbations of symptoms in a few patients. LIMITATIONS Studies were few and had many methodologic limitations. No study was a blinded, randomized, or placebo-controlled trial. Some pertinent studies may have been missed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia who received influenza-convalescent human blood products may have experienced a clinically important reduction in the risk for death. Convalescent human H5N1 plasma could be an effective, timely, and widely available treatment that should be studied in clinical trials.","output":"Meta-analysis: convalescent blood products for Spanish influenza pneumonia: a future H5N1 treatment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 5 leader is documented to be an important regulatory element in many (+) ssRNA virus genome.

In this study, we investigated the distribution and seasonal occurrences of respiratory viruses detected by multiplex molecular assay in 6,014 samples from 2008 to 2011 in a French hospital. We assessed the detection frequencies of 14 respiratory viruses and their clinical impact in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, we explored the preferential association patterns between respiratory viruses in multiple infections. Our results indicated that human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV) and coronavirus (HCoV) were frequently detected in respiratory samples (48.81% and 11.74% of infected samples, respectively), and the detection frequencies of these viruses were further increased in immunosuppressed patients. The most common subtypes of HCoV were HCoV-229E (33.80%) and HCoV-HKU1 (32.39%). A sharp increase in the detection frequencies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 over several months suggested that these subtypes were epidemic in our population. In immunosuppressed patients, HCoV contributed to upper respiratory tract infections (52%). Evidence did not support lower respiratory tract infections exclusive to a unique HCoV infection. In multiply infected individuals, determined in 6.3% of samples, HRV/EV and HCoV were detected in 33.29% and 22.90% of samples, respectively. Interestingly, nearly 50% of HCoV infections were detected in association with another virus.

METHODS: Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients' history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance.

We established a five-mRNA (LY6D, ANLN, ZNF488, MYEOV, and SCN11A) prognostic risk signature. Next, we identified ANLN and MYEOV that were associated with T lymphocyte infiltrations (P < 0.05). High ANLN and MYEOV expression levels had a poorer prognosis in decreased T lymphocyte subgroup in PC. Correlation analysis between ANLN and MYEOV and immunomodulators showed that ANLN and MYEOV may have potential value in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Bioinformatic Analysis of Prognostic and Immune-Related Genes in Pancreatic Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Indonesian government is incorporating Low-Carbon Development (LCD) into its National Medium-Term Development Plan 2020C2024. In the future, the energy sector will become the largest carbon emitter unless the government commits to dissolving barriers to renewable energy expansion.

This research aims to examine the barriers that hinder the implementation of LCD in Indonesia and to analyze which barriers are most significant. This study uses mixed methods. Qualitative and quantitative data were generated during fieldwork in DKI Jakarta, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, and Bangka Belitung provinces. The Partial Least Square C Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to measure the direction and strength of the relationship. The qualitative approach is useful for further deepening the provincial context that was not captured from the previous approach. This study indicates that among those four barriers, technological and governance barriers have negative significant and direct effects on LCD, and governance needs to be treated as the most critical barrier. This study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between central and local governments in implementing LCD.

It is important to understand the disease profile in different regions of the country in order to design strategies to fight the disease nationwide. The objective of this study was to analyse the time trend of the incidence and mortality of hepatitis C in Brazil during the period from 2008 to 2018 according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: All newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C reported between 2008 and 2018, in all regions of Brazil, were included. The indicators were obtained from the databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. For the time series analysis, a joinpoint regression model was used. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2018, 136,759 newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C were reported considering anti-HCV and HCV RNA positivity, and 271,624 newly diagnosed cases were reported considering one or another positive test. The majority of the records were concentrated in the Southeast (61%) and South (26.2%) Regions. The joinpoint regression model indicated an increasing trend in the detection rate of hepatitis C in Brazil, but there was a decreasing trend in the mortality rate during the period analysed.

In order to analyze the collected data from 415 Jordanian students among schools and universities, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. The empirical findings confirm that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significantly influenced by self-efficacy and perceived compatibility. Furthermore, perceived usefulness is significantly influenced by perceived convenience and perceived ease of use. Additionally, perceived enjoyment significantly influences the behavioral intention to use MLA. On the other hand, perceived compatibility has no significant influence on perceived enjoyment. Finally, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived compatibility have no significant effect on behavioral intention to use MLA.

A discussion of climate change without referring to scientific results is not imaginable. This is especially the case for policies since action on the macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society. In this study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy are connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents. The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point out that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have published more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that climate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents received significantly more citations on average than climate change papers that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and policy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth sciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a chain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment reports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents (policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government reports to legislative documents.","output":"How relevant is climate change research for climate change policy?

To provide further insight into insight into immune regulatory mechanisms in the lungs of CARDS (with and without DXM treatment) and critically ill non-COVID-19 patients (without DXM treatment), transcriptomic RNA-seq analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed in these patients. Functional analysis was performed using gene ontology and a blood transcription module, and gene expression of select pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and auto-IFN antibodies were assessed. We found 550 and 2173 differentially expressed genes in patients with non-DXM-CARDS and DXM-CARDS, respectively. DXM-CARDS was characterized by upregulation of genes related to pulmonary innate and adaptive immunity, notably B-cell and complement pathway activation, antigen presentation, phagocytosis and FC-gamma receptor signalling. Pro-inflammatory genes were not differentially expressed in CARDS vs. non-COVID-19, nor did they differ according to DXM. Most ISGs were specifically upregulated in CARDS, particularly in non-DXM-CARDS. Auto-IFN autoantibodies were detectable in BALF of some CARDS patients.

Using the NFAT5 N-terminal domain (NTD), which contains AD1, as a model, we demonstrate by biophysical methods that the NTD senses osmolytes and hypertonicity, resulting in stabilization of its ID regions. In the presence of sufficient NaCl or osmolytes, trehalose and sorbitol, the NFAT5 NTD undergoes a disorder-to-order shift, adopting higher average secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, NFAT5 is activated by the stress that it protects against. In its salt and/or osmolyte-induced more ordered conformation, the NTD interacts with several proteins, including HMGI-C, which is known to protect against apoptosis.

Unlike other vaccine-preventable diseases where individuals may have experienced reduced risk due to COVID-related mitigation efforts (e.g., lockdown restrictions, use of face masks), individuals remained at risk of herpes zoster (HZ). This study projects the impact of reduced recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) use on HZ cases and complications in the US. METHODS: A multi-cohort Markov model estimated the impact of missed RZV vaccinations, by comparing scenarios with and without missed vaccinations between Apr-Dec 2020, on cases of HZ, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) among US adults aged  50 years. Epidemiology, RZV efficacy, and utility inputs were obtained from standard US sources, clinical trial data, and published literature. Missed doses were estimated using data on RZV doses and an assumed 43% reduction in RZV vaccinations during the pandemic, based on publicly available data. Deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In 2020, approximately 21 million (M) RZV distributed doses were expected, including an estimated 9.2M RZV series initiations in Apr-Dec. An estimated 3.9M RZV series initiations were missed, resulting in 31,945 projected HZ cases, 2,714 PHN cases, and 610 lost QALYs projected over a 1-year follow up. If individuals with missed RZV initiations remain unvaccinated in 2021, avoidable HZ cases will increase to 63,117 over 2 years. Further, if the same number of RZV initiations are missed in 2021, 95,062 avoidable HZ cases are expected. In a sensitivity analysis assuming 30% RZV reduction, 18,020 avoidable HZ cases and 1,531 PHN cases were observed over 1 year. CONCLUSION: Adding to the substantial COVID-19 infection-related morbidity and mortality, reduced RZV use during the pandemic resulted in further burden from avoidable HZ cases. Health care providers should continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination against HZ and other preventable diseases during the pandemic.

It seems that identifying the processes involved in protective health behaviors can be effective in planning and implementing suitable interventions to encourage the community toward protective behaviors. Therefore, the present study aimed to predict the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 according to the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted over 2 months in Hormozgan Province, Iran. The study population consisted of all citizens above the age of 15 years. An online questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire link was available to the participants through social networks. The questionnaire consisted of two sections, including the demographic information and the PMT constructs. All statistical calculations and hypothesis testing were performed in SPSS Version 21 and AMOS Version 21. The significance level was considered to be 0.05 for hypothesis testing. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subjects, with the mean age of 34.84  9.8 years (r = 15-98), participated in this study. Most of the participants were 31-40 years old, female (60.4%), married (72%), urban residents (87.3%), and employed (58.8%). The majority of them also had a bachelor's degree or higher (58.8%). Significant positive correlations were observed between the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and the perceived vulnerability (r = 0.192, P < 0.001), perceived severity (r = 0.092, P < 0.001), response efficacy (r = 0.398, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (r = 0.497, P < 0.001), and protection motivation (r = 0.595, P < 0.001).

Moreover, Co-MnOx benefiting from the rapid electron migration between Mn and Co, more active bidentate/bridged nitrates could react with adsorbed NH3 in faster reaction rates following the L-H mechanism.","output":"Evolution mechanism of transition metal in NH3-SCR reaction over Mn-based bimetallic oxide catalysts: Structure-activity relationships."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the research and innovation to produce raw materials from microbial processes has gained much attention due to their economic and environmental impacts. Lactic acid is a very important microbial product due to its wide application in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries. In the current study, poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was produced by the ring opening polymerization (ROP) technique of L-lactic acid recovered from whey fermentation, and was used for the production of nanocomposites films reinforced with chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) (average diameter ca. 100-200 nm). Three different CNPs concentrations, namely 1, 3, and 5% w/w, were tested, and their influence on the physical, mechanical, thermal, antibacterial and structural attributes of PLLA film was assessed. The results showed that the addition of CNPs up to 3% caused a significant improvement in water vapor permeability, appearance, tensile strength and elongation at break. The antibacterial properties of nanocomposites followed a dose-depended pattern as a result of CNPs addition. Therefore, the best inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was made by the addition of 5% of CNPs and lower dosages slightly affected the growth of pathogens or didn't cause any inhibitory effects (in 1% of CNPs). It can be concluded that the incorporation of CNPs into the PLLA matrix allows to improve the structural, thermal, physical, mechanical and antibacterial properties of the polymer, generating promising systems for food packaging and biomedical applications.","output":"Tuning the Physicochemical, Structural, and Antimicrobial Attributes of Whey-Based Poly (L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA) Films by Chitosan Nanoparticles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines immunogenicity in patients with cancer has been investigated, whether they can significantly improve the severity of COVID-19 in this specific population is undefined. METHODS: Capitalizing on OnCovid (NCT04393974) registry data we reported COVID-19 mortality and proxies of COVID-19 morbidity, including post COVID-19 outcomes, according to the vaccination status of the included patients. RESULTS: 2090 eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 02/2020 and 11/2021 were included, of whom 1930 (92.3%) unvaccinated, 91 (4.4%) fully vaccinated and 69 (3.3%) partially vaccinated. With the exception of a higher prevalence of patients from the UK (p=0.0003) and receiving systemic anticancer therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis (p=0.0082) among fully vaccinated patients, no demographics/oncological features were associated with vaccination status. The 14-days case fatality rate (CFR) (5.5% vs 20.7%, p=0.0004) and the 28-days CFR (13.2% vs 27.4%, p=0.0028) demonstrated a significant improvement for fully vaccinated patients in comparison with unvaccinated patients. The receipt of prior full vaccination was also associated with reduced symptomatic COVID-19 (79.1% vs 88.5%, p=0.0070), need of COVID-19 oriented therapy (34.9% vs 63.2%, p<0.0001), complications from COVID-19 (28.6% vs 39.4%, p=0.0379), hospitalizations due to COVID-19 (42.2% vs 52.5%, p=0.0007), and oxygen therapy requirement (35.7% vs 52%, p=0.0036). Following Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW) procedure no statistically significant difference according to the vaccination status was confirmed; however, all COVID-19 related outcomes were concordantly in favour of full vaccination.

Therefore, the application of energy efficiency measurements is urgently needed to reduce the levels of power consumption. Over the last years, various methods have been used to predict household electricity consumption. As a novelty, this paper proposed a method of predicting the consumption of household appliances by evaluating statistical distributions (KolmogorovCSmirnov Test and Pearsons X2 test). To test the veracity of the evaluations, first, a set of random values was simulated for each hour, and their respective averages were calculated. These were compared with the averages of the real values for each hour. With the exception of HVAC during working days, great results were obtained. For the refrigerator, the maximum error was 3.91%, while for the lighting, it was 4.27%. At the point of consumption, the accuracy was even higher, with an error of 1.17% for the dryer while for the washing machine and dishwasher, their minimum errors were less than 1%. The error results confirm that the applied methodology is perfectly acceptable for modeling household appliance consumption and consequently predicting it.

Rabies is a lethal encephalitis caused by rabies virus (RV). This RNA virus can infect a range of terrestrial mammals but each viral variant persists in a particular reservoir host. Active management of these host vectors is needed to minimize the negative impacts of this disease, and an understanding of the immune response to RV infection aids strategies for host vaccination. Current knowledge of immune responses to RV infection comes primarily from rodent models in which an innate immune response triggers activation of several genes and signalling pathways. It is unclear, however, how well rodent models represent the immune response of natural hosts. This study investigates the innate immune response of a primary host, the raccoon, to a peripheral challenge using the raccoon rabies virus (RRV). The extent and temporal course of this response during RRV infection was analysed using genes predicted to be upregulated during infection (IFNs; IFN regulatory factors; IL-6; Toll like receptor-3; TNF receptor). We found that RRV activated components of the innate immune system, with changes in levels of transcripts correlated with presence of viral RNA. Our results suggest that natural reservoirs of rabies may not mimic the immune response triggered in rodent models, highlighting the need for further studies of infection in primary hosts.","output":"Innate immune responses in raccoons after raccoon rabies virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental Health Weekly readers continue to weigh in on what awaits them in the new year.

DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND MAIN MEASURES: This is a prospective cohort study of patients who had severe COVID-19 requiring an ICU admission in a two-hospital academic health system in Southern California. Patients discharged alive between 3/21/2020 and 12/31/2020 were surveyed approximately 6 months after discharge to assess health-related quality of life using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS?)-29 v2.1, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and loneliness scales. A preference-based health utility score (PROPr) was estimated using 7 PROMIS domain scores. Patients were also asked their attitude about receiving aggressive ICU care. KEY RESULTS: Of 275 patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19, 205 (74.5%) were discharged alive and 132 (64%, median age 59, 46% female) completed surveys a median of 182 days post-discharge. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social activities, pain interference, and cognitive function were not significantly different from the U.S. general population, but physical function (44.2, SD 11.0) was worse. PROPr mean score of 0.46 (SD 0.30, range ?0.02 to 0.96 [<0 is worse than dead and 1 represents perfect health]) was slightly lower than the U.S. general population, with an even distribution across the continuum. Poor PROPr was associated with chronic medical conditions and receipt of life-sustaining treatments, but not demographics or social vulnerability. PTSD was suspected in 20% and loneliness in 29% of patients. Ninety-eight percent of patients were glad they received life-saving treatment.

Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection.

Our aim was twofold: (1) to determine the perception of the ethical climate, levels of moral distress, and intention to leave one's job among nurses and physicians, and between the different ICU types and (2) determine the association between the ethical climate, moral distress, and intention to leave. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study between May 2021 and August 2021 involving 206 nurses and physicians in a large urban academic hospital. We used the validated Ethical Decision-Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) and the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) tools and asked respondents their intention to leave their jobs. We also made comparisons between the different ICU types. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to identify statistically significant associations between the Ethical Climate, Moral Distress, and Intention to Leave. RESULTS: Nurses perceived the ethical climate for decision-making as less favorable than physicians (p < 0.05). They also had significantly greater levels of moral distress and higher intention to leave their job rates than physicians. Regarding the ICU types, the Neonatal/Pediatric unit had a significantly higher overall ethical climate score than the Medical and Surgical units (3.54  0.66 vs. 3.43  0.81 vs. 3.30  0.69; respectively; both p  0.05) and also demonstrated lower moral distress scores (both p < 0.05) and lower intention to leave scores compared with both the Medical and Surgical units. The ethical climate and moral distress scores were negatively correlated (r = ?0.58, p < 0.001); moral distress and \\"intention to leave\\" was positively correlated (r = 0.52, p < 0.001); and ethical climate and intention to leave were negatively correlated (r = ?0.50, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences exist in the perception of the ethical climate, levels of moral distress, and intention to leave between nurses and physicians and between the different ICU types. Inspecting the individual factors of the ethical climate and moral distress tools can help hospital leadership target organizational factors that improve interprofessional collaboration, lessening moral distress, decreasing turnover, and improved patient care.

In addition, the circadian disruption caused by shiftwork may further impact workers cardiometabolic health and cognitive performance. This protocol paper outlines the methodology for exploring the impact of simultaneous exposure to prolonged sitting, sleep restriction and circadian disruption on cardiometabolic and cognitive performance outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This between-subjects study will recruit 208 males and females to complete a 7-day in-laboratory experimental protocol (1 Adaptation Day, 5 Experimental Days and 1 Recovery Day). Participants will be allocated to one of eight conditions that include all possible combinations of the following: dayshift or nightshift, sitting or breaking up sitting and 5 hour or 9 hour sleep opportunity. On arrival to the laboratory, participants will be provided with a 9 hour baseline sleep opportunity (22:00 to 07:00) and complete five simulated work shifts (09:00 to 17:30 in the dayshift condition and 22:00 to 06:30 in the nightshift condition) followed by a 9 hour recovery sleep opportunity (22:00 to 07:00). During the work shifts participants in the sitting condition will remain seated, while participants in the breaking up sitting condition will complete 3-min bouts of light-intensity walking every 30 mins on a motorised treadmill. Sleep opportunities will be 9 hour or 5 hour.

Combined genomics and transcription factor profiling reveal that MAST1, a critical platinum resistance factor that reprograms the MAPK pathway, is upregulated upon cisplatin exposure through activated transcription factor GR. Mechanistically, cisplatin binds to C622 in GR and recruits GR to the nucleus for its activation, which induces MAST1 expression and consequently reactivates MEK signaling. GR nuclear translocation and MAST1 upregulation coordinately occur in patient tumors collected after platinum treatment, and align with patient treatment resistance. Co-treatment with dexamethasone and cisplatin restores cisplatin-resistant tumor growth, whereas addition of the MAST1 inhibitor lestaurtinib abrogates tumor growth while preserving the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on inflammation in vivo. These findings not only provide insights into the underlying mechanism of GR in cisplatin resistance but also offer an effective alternative therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcome of patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy with GR agonists.","output":"Cisplatin-mediated activation of glucocorticoid receptor induces platinum resistance via MAST1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed the world at a pandemic risk. Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization.

Influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, and several other pathogenic viruses are mainly recognized by RIG-I, resulting in the activation of the innate immune responses. The protein comprises N-terminal two caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARDs), an RNA helicase domain, and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD recognizes 5-triphosphate viral dsRNA. After recognition of viral dsRNA, the protein harbors K63-linked polyubiquitination essential for RIG-I activation. First, it was reported that TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase delivered K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety to the 2CARDs. The polyubiquitin chain stabilizes a structure called the 2CARD tetramer, in which four 2CARDs assemble and make a core that promotes the aggregation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein on mitochondria. MAVS aggregation then triggers the signal to induce the innate immune responses. However, subsequent studies have reported that Riplet, MEX3C, and TRIM4 ubiquitin ligases are also involved in K63-linked polyubiquitination and the activation of RIG-I. MEX3C and TRIM4 mediate polyubiquitination of the 2CARDs. By contrast, Riplet ubiquitinates the CTD. The physiological significance of each ubiquitin ligases has been shown by knockout and knockdown studies, but there appears to be contradictory to evidence reported in the literature. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to K63-linked polyubiquitination and propose a model that could reconcile current contradictory theories.

Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases.

We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents.

The bactericidal activities of Ag/MnO2 depended on the MnO2 crystal phase. Among these nanomaterials, Ag/-MnO2 showed the highest bactericidal activity.

From each district, we enrolled at least 400 individuals aged &#8805; 10 years from general population and 100 HCWs from sub-district level health facilities. Sera from general population were tested for presence of IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and spike protein (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, whereas sera from HCWs were tested for anti-S1-RBD. We estimated weighted seroprevalence adjusted for assay characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 28,598 sera from general population, 4585 (16%) had IgG antibodies against N, 6647 (23.2%) against S1-RBD and 7436 (26%) against either. The weighted and assay characteristic adjusted seroprevalence against either of the antibodies was 24.1 (95%CI: 23.0%-25.3%). Among 7385 HCWs, the seroprevalence of anti-S1-RBD IgG antibodies was 25.6% (95% CI: 23.5%-27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in four individuals aged > = 10 years from general population as well as HCWs in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by December 2020.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence among general population and healthcare workers in India, December 2020 - January 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The main purpose of the present study was to determine the socio demographic parameters associated to physical activity (PA) patterns changes during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Spanish population.

A 34-year-old woman presented with severe right hemiplegia and ataxia. She was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 13 years ago and treated with rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) during the last 15 months. She had received her first dose of adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) three months after her last infusion of rituximab and three days before experiencing her latest MS relapse episode, preceded by mild symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, generalized weakness, etc.). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed several new periventricular, juxtacortical, brainstem, and cerebellar peduncle lesions. She received corticosteroid therapy for five consecutive days, and her neurological deficits slightly improved. Twenty-one days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, her anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were below the lower detection limit. However, a decision was made to adhere to the vaccination schedule and not risk the patient's safety against an unfortunate COVID-19 contraction, and thus, she was advised to receive the second Gam-COVID-Vac dose after discontinuation of oral steroid taper. The safety of adenovirus-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune diseases requires further investigation. Meanwhile, clinicians should raise awareness among their patients regarding the potentially limited efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in those treated with anti-CD20 treatments.

Our implementation offers robustness, safety and functionality absent in existing solutions to the ventilator shortage (i.e., telemonitoring, easy-to-disinfect, modularity) by maintaining simplicity. The design makes use of a manual resuscitator as the core respiration component activated by a compression mechanism which consist of two electronically controlled paddles.

Initiatives where students engage in independent research linked to cutting-edge physics within their school over several months might help mitigate this, potentially facilitating the uptake of science in higher education. However, how such initiatives are best supported remains unclear and understudied. This paper evaluates a provision framework, \`Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), using survey data from participating 14-18 year-old students and their teachers to understand their experience of the programme. The results show that PRiSE appears to provide much more positive experiences than typical university outreach initiatives due to the nature of the opportunities afforded over several months, which schools would not be able to provide without external input. The intensive support offered is deemed necessary, with all elements appearing equally important. Based on additional feedback from independent researchers and engagement professionals, we also suggest the framework could be adopted at other institutions and applied to their own areas of scientific research, something which has already started to occur.","output":"Evaluating participants' experience of extended interaction with cutting-edge physics research through the PRiSE 'research in schools' programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which in turn activate protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines to ultimately influence the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in vitro by inhibiting angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) expression. The rheological, anti-inflammatory, and renin-angiotensin axis properties of PTX highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with COVID-19 by helping reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines without deleterious effects on the immune system to delay viral clearance. Moreover, PTX can restore the balance of the immune response, reduce damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, improve circulation, and prevent microvascular thrombosis. There is further evidence that PTX can improve ventilatory parameters. Therefore, we propose repositioning PTX in the treatment of COVID-19. The main advantage of repositioning PTX is that it is an affordable drug that is already available worldwide with an established safety profile, further offering the possibility of immediately analysing the result of its use and associated success rates. Another advantage is that PTX selectively reduces the concentration of TNF-&#945; mRNA in cells, which, in the case of an acute infectious state such as COVID-19, would seem to offer a more strategic approach.","output":"Repositioning of pentoxifylline as an immunomodulator and regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current scenario generated by the Covid-19 pandemic enhances the condition of food and nutrition insecurity due to the worsening of poverty, hunger and lack of access to food, as well as the excess consumption of foods considered unhealthy The effects of the pandemic enhances the need for a new way of arranging the production, distribution and consumption of food, giving new meaning to the relationship between food, eating and the environment Thus, it is suggested that a reflection be made on the strategies for the appropriate healthy, adequate and sustainable diet in Brazil to face this health emergency Actions must be focused on the articulation of strategies that foster sovereignty, food and nutrition security and healthier and more sustainable food systems such as the strengthening of family farming;income assurance for the population;access to quality food;changes in the food environment;dissemination of information on healthy and sustainable food in official recommendations for the pandemic and food guides covering the entire food system, as well as food and nutrition education practices RESUMO O cenrio atual gerado pela pandemia da Covid-19 acentua a condio de inseguran?a alimentar e nutricional pelo agravamento da situao de pobreza, da fome e da falta de acesso aos alimentos, assim como pelo excesso do consumo de alimentos considerados n?o saudveis Os reflexos da pandemia refor?am a necessidade de uma nova forma de constituir a produo, a distribuio e o consumo dos alimentos, ressignificando a relao com o alimento, o comer e o ambiente Assim, prop?e-se refletir sobre as estratgias para a promoo da alimentao saudvel, adequada e sustentvel no Brasil para o enfrentamento desta emergncia sanitria As aes precisam estar centradas na articulao das estratgias que promovam a soberania, a seguran?a alimentar e nutricional e sistemas alimentares mais saudveis e sustentveis como o fortalecimento da agricultura familiar;garantia de renda para a populao;acesso a alimentos de qualidade;mudan?as no ambiente alimentar;divulgao de informaes sobre alimentao saudvel e sustentvel em recomendaes oficiais para a pandemia e guias alimentares que abranjam todo o sistema alimentar, assim como prticas de educao alimentar e nutricional","output":"Strategies for the promotion of healthy, adequate and sustainable food in Brazil in times of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of immune reconstitution therapies (IRT) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is associated with a prolonged period of freedom from relapses in the absence of continuously applied therapy.

Due to the exponential spread of the COVID-19 infection worldwide, several computational models for forecasting the transmission and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been proposed in the literature. To accelerate scientific and public health insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19, Google released the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms open-access dataset. Our objective is to develop 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting models of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in the US using the Google search trends for COVID-19 related symptoms. Specifically, we propose a stacked long short-term memory (SLSTM) architecture for predicting COVID-19 confirmed and death cases using historical time series data combined with auxiliary time series data from the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms dataset. Considering the SLSTM networks trained using historical data only as the base models, our base models for 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID cases had the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively. On the other side, our proposed models had improved MAPE values of 3.2% and 5.6%, respectively.

METHODS: All patients with LM disease (&#8805;50% stenosis) undergoing coronary revascularisation in England between January 1, 2017 and August 19, 2020 were included (n = 22,235), stratified by time-period (pre-COVID: 01/01/2017-29/2/2020; COVID: 1/3/2020-19/8/2020) and revascularisation strategy (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Logistic regression models were performed to examine odds ratio (OR) of 1) receipt of CABG (vs. PCI) and 2) in-hospital and 30-day postprocedural mortality, in the COVID-19 period (vs. pre-COVID). RESULTS: There was a decline of 1,354 LM revascularisation procedures between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 compared with previous years' (2017-2019) averages (-48.8%). An increased utilization of PCI over CABG was observed in the COVID period (receipt of CABG vs. PCI: OR 0.46 [0.39, 0.53] compared with 2017), consistent across all age groups. No difference in adjusted in-hospital or 30-day mortality was observed between pre-COVID and COVID periods for both PCI (odds ratio (OR): 0.72 [0.51. 1.02] and 0.83 [0.62, 1.11], respectively) and CABG (OR 0.98 [0.45, 2.14] and 1.51 [0.77, 2.98], respectively) groups.

However, the mechanism by which frailty is associated with mortality is not yet understood. Autonomic dysfunction in the form of decreased intraoperative hemodynamic variability has been shown to be associated with increased mortality. We aimed to see whether frail patients have less hemodynamic variability under anesthesia and whether variability mediates the relationship between frailty and 30-day mortality. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective study of 1223 patients 65 years of age undergoing surgery between July 2008 and December 2012. We used markers of frailty: age >70, preoperative body mass index <18.5, hematocrit <35%, albumin <3.4 g/dL, and creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. We modeled the outcome of 30-day mortality with number of frailty conditions adjusting for gender, length of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and need for transfusion. Intraoperative hemodynamic variability was defined as the count of episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional mean arterial pressure (MAP) between consecutive 5-minute intervals. We evaluated the role of intraoperative hemodynamic variability as a mediator (modifier) of the relationship between frailty and mortality, checking for 3 conditions: (1) frailty must affect episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP; (2) episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP must affect 30-day mortality; and (3) mediation effect is significant. We used the product method, in which the mediation effect was estimated as the product of the first 2 relationships. Then we applied the percentile bootstrap method to obtain the 95% CI for the estimate of mediation effect. RESULTS Number of frailty conditions and episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP were inversely proportional. Presence of 4 frailty conditions was associated with >40% reduction of the number of episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP. Regarding mortality, episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP were protective. The addition of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP in the mortality model resulted in a decrease in the frailty odds ratio from 10.6 to 9.1 (4+ conditions), suggesting that episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP are indeed a mediator. The mediation effect was modest; 5 episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP was 5.2%, 6.4%, 6.9%, and 9.0% for frailty conditions from 1 to 4+, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Frailty is associated with less intraoperative blood pressure variation, and the relationship of frailty with 30-day mortality is partially mediated by episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP. This suggests that autonomic dysregulation may be a modest part of the mechanism behind the association between frailty and perioperative mortality. Our finding is consistent with recent literature, suggesting that an intact autonomic nervous system confers lower perioperative mortality.","output":"Association of Preoperative Frailty With Intraoperative Hemodynamic Instability and Postoperative Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Respiratory disorders pose a major threat to the morbidity and mortality to public health.

METHODS: Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched until 29th June 2020. Studies were included in the review if they used HMD technology to present virtual environments that aimed to promote or measure relaxation, or relaxation-related variables. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool was used to assess methodological quality of studies. RESULTS: 6403 articles were identified through database searching. Nineteen studies published between 2007 and 2020, with 1278 participants, were included in the review. Of these, thirteen were controlled studies. Studies predominantly used natural audio-visual stimuli to promote relaxation. Findings indicate feasibility, acceptability, and short-term effectiveness of VR to increase relaxation and reduce stress.

Consequently, the relevance of a sufficiently high VitD serum level becomes self-evident. METHODS: A rapid immunofluorescence assay designed for the point-of-care measurement of serum VitD(3) solely was tested. Inter- and intra-assay validation, double testing and result comparison with a standardized laboratory method were performed. RESULTS: An overall linear correlation of r = 0.89 (Pearson, 95% CI 0.88C0.92, p < 0.01) between the point of care and the conventional reference assay was registered. Accuracy and precision were of special interest at cut-points (10 ng/ml [mean deviation 1.7 ng/ml, SD 1.98 ng/ml, SE 0.16 ng/ml], 12 ng/ml [MD 0.41, SD 1.89, SE 0.19] and 30 ng/ml [MD ? 1.11, SD 3.89, SE 0.35]).

FINDINGS: COVID-19 control in Pakistan has restricted people's ability to travel and this has forced the TB programme to reduce the need for in-person health facility visits and bring care closer to patients' homes. Strategies that may be useful for providing more convenient care to patients in the future include: : remote treatment support using telemedicine; collaborating with private healthcare providers; and establishing community medicine collection points. As part of the response to COVID-19 in Pakistan, the out-patient departments of major tertiary and secondary care hospitals were closed, and this highlighted the importance of strengthening primary healthcare for both better pandemic and TB control.

METHODS The retrospective cohort study included 63 patients who underwent transvaginal surgery using a synthetic polypropylene mesh (Gynemesh?) for cystocele. Patients were evaluated using a clinical examination (POP-Q) and validated questionnaires (PGI-I, PFDI-20, PFIQ-7) at 18 years of follow-up (median 18 years [IQR 16-19]). Cumulative death rate was 13 out of 63 (20%) and rate of total loss to follow-up was 21 out of 50 (42%). Finally, among the 63 women who underwent surgery, 29 completed maximum follow-up and 21 underwent a clinical examination. RESULTS The cumulative reoperation rate was 35% (22 out of 63). Three patients were reoperated on because of recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse. Among the 63 patients initially operated, vaginal mesh exposure occurred in 16 (25%) during follow-up and 11 women (17%) needed a reintervention for vaginal mesh exposure. One patient was reoperated on for bladder mesh exposure. Among the 29 women who completed follow-up, the overall postoperative improvement rate was 93% after 18 years (PGI-I: 1-3). Mean overall satisfaction rate was 80 out of 100. Functional success rate was 76% (22 out of 29) and anatomical success rate was 62% (13 out of 21).

Although our understanding of burnout has advanced considerably in recent years, little is known about the effects of burnout on nursing faculty turnover intentions and career satisfaction. Objective: To test a hypothesized model examining the effects of workClife interference on nursing faculty burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism), turnover intentions and, ultimately, career satisfaction. Design: A predictive cross-sectional design was used. Settings: An online national survey of nursing faculty members was administered throughout Canada in summer 2021.

Methods: Data were collected from an anonymous survey housed on Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics and reliability estimates were computed. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Results: Data suggest that workClife interference significantly increases burnout which contributes to both higher turnover intentions and lower career satisfaction. Turnover intentions, in turn, decrease career satisfaction.

For this, we examined host cell entry driven by glycoproteins (GP) from all filovirus species into cell lines of human and fruit bat origin. We show that all GPs were able to mediate entry into human and most fruit bat cell lines with roughly comparable efficiency. In contrast, the efficiency of entry into the cell line EidNi/41 derived from a straw-colored fruit bat varied markedly between the GPs of different filovirus species. Furthermore, inhibition studies demonstrated that filoviruses employ the same host cell factors for entry into human, non-human primate and fruit bat cell lines, including cysteine proteases, two pore channels and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1 molecule). Finally, processing of GP by furin and the presence of the mucin-like domain in GP were dispensable for entry into both human and bat cell lines.

There were 6 cases of ischemia (7.14%), 2 cases of stroke (2.38%), and 1 case of decompensated heart failure (1.19%). Among our patients, 46.42% had diabetes, 32.14% had a high blood pressure, 13.09% had a chronic renal failure and 14.28% had a history of ischemic heart disease. 14 patients (16.66%) had an elevated troponin with higher levels than 1000a?ng/mL. The D-dimer value was high in almost all patients (80.95%). Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 27.38%, severe in 32.14%, and critical in 40.47% of enrolled cases. CT chest angiography, ECG, and cardiac ultrasound were performed to the paraclinical confirmatory exploration of cardiac damages of these patients. Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab was indicated for 17 patients with hyperferritinemia (20.23% of patients). The initial respiratory care of our patients required oxygen therapy using nasal cannula (7.14%) high concentration masks (33.33%), high flow nasal cannula treatment (11.9%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (5.95%), and mechanical ventilation (41.66%). Thrombolysis was performed in three subjects with myocardial infarction and 2 underwent angioplasty with placement of an active stent at the proximal interventricular anterior artery, which all were successful. Three massive pulmonary embolisms died despite adequate treatment. Colchicine and salicylic acid were administered for pericarditis cases. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated for all patients and was reinforced if a venous thrombotic episode was confirmed. Patients with limb ischemia underwent surgical treatment. Among the 84 patients included in our cohort, 34 (40.47%) died in intensive care unit and 50 (59.52%) had a favorable evolution.

Procalcitonin is classically used as a diagnostic marker in bacterial infections, but its role in predicting Covid-19 disease severity is emerging. We aimed to identify the association between procalcitonin and Covid-19 disease severity in a critical care setting and whether bacterial co-infection is implicated. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Covid-19 patients with procalcitonin concentrations measured in a critical care setting at our institution between February and September 2020. Laboratory markers including peak procalcitonin values and a range of bacterial culture results were analysed. Outcomes were the requirement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as well as inpatient mortality. RESULTS: In total, 60 patients were included; 68% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 45% died as inpatient. Univariate analysis identified higher peak procalcitonin concentrations significantly associated with both the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, P = 0.02) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.6, P = 0.03). Higher peak procalcitonin concentrations was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.4, P = 0.03). There was a significant positive correlation between increased peak procalcitonin concentrations and duration on invasive mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between peak procalcitonin concentrations of patients with positive and negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated procalcitonin concentrations in Covid-19 patients are associated with respiratory failure requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and inpatient mortality. This association may be independent of bacterial co-infection.","output":"Elevated procalcitonin concentrations in severe Covid-19 may not reflect bacterial co-infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Having inadequate health care systems and poor socio-economic infrastructure, Bangladesh has been braving to contain the impact of current COVID-19 pandemic since March, 2020. To curb the diffusion of COVID-19, the local government has responded to the outbreak by enforcing a set of restricted measures on economic and social activities across the country. OBJECTIVES: Here, we aim to assess the propagation of COVID-19 by estimating the coronavirus active cases and mortality rate in two major business hubs of Bangladesh, namely Dhaka and Chittagong city under flexible lockdown conditions. METHODS: We apply a data-driven forecasting model using Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deaths status through time to deal with coronavirus outbreak. RESULTS: The epidemiological model forecasts the dire consequences for Dhaka city with 2400 death cases at the end of December, 2020, whereas Chittagong city might experience 14% more deaths than Dhaka if the severe restrictions are not implemented to control the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Although lockdown has a positive impact in reducing the diffusion of COVID-19, it is disastrous for human welfare and national economies. Therefore, a unidirectional decision by the policymakers might cost a very high price on either way for a lower-middle-income country, Bangladesh. In this study, we suggest a fair trade-off between public health and the economy to avoid enormous death tolls and economic havoc in Bangladesh.","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka and Chittagong: Two business hubs of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to a sharp rise in opioid-involved overdose deaths in the USA, states have deployed increasingly aggressive strategies to limit the loss of life, including civil commitment-the forcible detention of individuals whose opioid use presents a clear and convincing danger to themselves or others.

Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. OBJECTIVES Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. SEARCH METHODS On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross-checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta-analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID-19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). Objective 1: a mixed-methods study that incorporated a cluster-randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work-based intervention, provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well-being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well-being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID-19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow-up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings.","output":"Interventions to support the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic: a mixed methods systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of tele-clinics on palliative care patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study (chart review) carried out from March 17, 2020, to September 16, 2020, included all patients who were booked into the palliative care clinic. Patients were assessed by the palliative nurse specialist for COVID-19 symptoms using the acute respiratory illness screening form and Edmonton Symptoms Assessment System, also identifies the needs of the patient. Data were analyzed to investigate the effect of tele-clinics on the patients regarding ER visits and admission. RESULTS: A total of 167 individuals were analyzed and the results showed that 234 of 447 visits were virtual, supporting the increasing value of telemedicine. The number of virtual patients' visits dropped slightly at the beginning of the pandemic (46.4% in March to 39.8% in July). Subsequently, it increased steadily to 72.2% in September. The choice of virtual/non-virtual visits for individuals with cancer diagnosis significantly depends on other factors.

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in a province of Indonesia with a high TB prevalence. Two districts representing rural and urban areas were selected to obtain information from TB service providers (i.e., physicians and nurses) at the CHC level. In addition, key informant interviews with TB patients, hospital TB specialists, pharmacists, and activists were conducted. The trustworthiness and credibility of the information were established using information saturation, participant validation, and triangulation approaches. The interviews were also transcribed for the inductive analysis using Atlas.ti 8.4 software. Results: We identified 210 meaning units from 48 participants and classified them into two main themes: organizational capacity and TB program activities. We identified the inadequacy of human resources, facility, and external coordination as the main barriers to organizational capacity. Furthermore, the barriers were identified regarding TB program activities, that is, inadequate TB case finding, diagnosis, drug supply chain and dispensing management, treatment and monitoring, case recording and reporting, and public-private collaboration.

Since its recent appearance, genomic epidemiology included the precise identification of new lineages or species of pathogens and the reconstruction of their genetic variability in real time, evidenced in past outbreaks of influenza H1N1, MERS, and SARS.

The aim of this study was to compare post-extubation morbidity and TT exchange rates when using cuffed vs uncuffed tubes in small children. METHODS Patients aged from birth to 5 yr requiring general anaesthesia with TT intubation were included in 24 European paediatric anaesthesia centres. Patients were prospectively randomized into a cuffed TT group (Microcuff PET) and an uncuffed TT group (Mallinckrodt, Portex, Rsch, Sheridan). Endpoints were incidence of post-extubation stridor and the number of TT exchanges to find an appropriate-sized tube. For cuffed TTs, minimal cuff pressure required to seal the airway was noted; maximal cuff pressure was limited at 20 cm H(2)O with a pressure release valve. Data are mean (SD). RESULTS A total of 2246 children were studied (1119/1127 cuffed/uncuffed). The age was 1.93 (1.48) yr in the cuffed and 1.87 (1.45) yr in the uncuffed groups.

Methods: We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with COVID-19 (0-15 yrs.-old) between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020. We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of children's lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells, RNA-sequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infections. Results: It revealed that infants (< 1yrs.-old), with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children (> 1 yrs.-old) are more resistant to lung injury. The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in children's lung. ACE2 is notably expressed not only in Alveolar Type II (AT II) cells, but also in SOX9 positive lung progenitor cells detected in both pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants' lungs. The ACE2+SOX9+ cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children. Conclusions: Infants (< 1 yrs.-old) with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more vulnerable to lung injuries.

To address these problems, we propose an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) segmentation model, called U-shaped GAN, for limited-annotated chest radiograph datasets. The semi-supervised learning approach and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach are modeled into a unified framework for effective segmentation. We improve GAN by replacing the traditional discriminator with a U-shaped net, which predicts each pixel a label. The proposed U-shaped net is designed with high resolution radiographs (1,024  1,024) for effective segmentation while taking computational burden into account. The pointwise convolution is applied to U-shaped GAN for dimensionality reduction, which decreases the number of feature maps while retaining their salient features. Moreover, we design the U-shaped net with a pretrained ResNet-50 as an encoder to reduce the computational burden of training the encoder from scratch. A semi-supervised learning approach is proposed learning from limited annotated data while exploiting additional unannotated data with a pixel-level loss. U-shaped GAN is extended to UDA by taking the source and target domain data as the annotated data and the unannotated data in the semi-supervised learning approach, respectively. Compared to the previous models dealing with the aforementioned problems separately, U-shaped GAN is compatible with varying data distributions of multiple medical centers, with efficient training and optimizing performance. U-shaped GAN can be generalized to chest radiograph segmentation for clinical deployment. We evaluate U-shaped GAN with two chest radiograph datasets. U-shaped GAN is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models.","output":"U-shaped GAN for Semi-Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in High Resolution Chest Radiograph Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is a severe complication associated with a high mortality. However, evidence and guidance on management is sparse. The aim of this international survey was to assess differences in prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies for AE-IPF in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres worldwide. Material and Methods: Pulmonologists working in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres were invited to participate in a survey designed by an international expert panel. Responses were evaluated in respect to the physicians' institutions. Results: Three hundred and two (65%) of the respondents worked in a specialised ILD centre, 134 (29%) in a non-specialised pulmonology centre. Similarities were frequent with regards to diagnostic methods including radiology and screening for infection, treatment with corticosteroids, use of high-flow oxygen and non-invasive ventilation in critical ill patients and palliative strategies. However, differences were significant in terms of the use of KL-6 and pathogen testing in urine, treatments with cyclosporine and recombinant thrombomodulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in critical ill patients as well as antacid medication and anaesthesia measures as preventive methods. Conclusion: Despite the absence of recommendations, approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AE-IPF are comparable in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres, yet certain differences in the managements of AE-IPF exist.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa implemented a nationwide lockdown as confirmed cases continued to rise. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on SLPs has a three-fold purpose: to re-evaluate service provision, service delivery platforms and to identify the need for support to SLPs during a time of crisis. It is also crucial in guiding how policies and interventions need to be modified. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to better understand how the workspace of SLPs in hospitals was impacted by COVID-19, how they experienced this process and the implications for them as healthcare professionals in both the private and public sector throughout South Africa. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory cross-sectional study design was used to meet the aims of the study. Thirty-nine SLPs from different provinces in South Africa, working in government and private hospitals during COVID-19, responded to the online survey. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: SLPs' roles, responsibilities and service delivery were impacted by COVID-19. It was necessary for typical outpatient therapy services to be modified; there were changes to the role of the SLP in the hospital and inpatient services were curtailed. CONCLUSION: This study provides insightful information to SLPs employed in hospitals to know that they are experiencing similar challenges.

Long-term exposure to subinhibitory level QACs can lead to multidrug resistance, but the contribution of mutagenesis to resistance evolution is obscure. In this study, we subcultured E. coli K-12 under subinhibitory (0.25 and 0.5 Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC) or inhibitory (1 and 2  MIC) concentrations of benzalkonium chloride (BAC, mono-chained) or didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC, twin-chained) for 60 days. The sensitivity of QAC-adapted cells to five typical antibiotics decreased significantly, and in particular, the MIC of rifampicin increased by 85 times. E. coli adapted faster to BAC but developed 20C167% higher antibiotic resistance with 56% more mutations under DDAC exposure. The broader mutations induced by QACs, including negative regulators (acrR, marR, soxR, and crp), outer membrane proteins and transporters (mipA and sbmA), and RNA polymerase (rpoB and rpoC), potentially contributed to the high multi-drug resistance. After QACs stresses were removed, the phenotypic resistance induced by subinhibitory concentrations of QACs was reversible, whereas that induced by inhibitory concentrations of QACs was irreversible. The different patterns and molecular mechanism of antibiotic resistance induced by BAC and DDAC is informative to estimating the risks of broader QACs present at varied concentrations in the environment.","output":"Molecular mechanism of antibiotic resistance induced by mono- and twin-chained quaternary ammonium compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity and life expectancy of quilombola elders.

In this regard, the province-wise data from Nepal provides a unique opportunity to study the effective control strategies. This is because (a) some provinces of Nepal share an open-border with India, resulting in a significantly high inflow of COVID-19 cases from India; (b) despite the inflow of a considerable number of cases, the local spread was quite controlled until mid-June of 2020, presumably due to control policies implemented; and (c) the relaxation of policies caused a rapid surge of the COVID-19 cases, providing a multi-phasic trend of disease dynamics. In this study, we used this unique data set to explore the inter-provincial disparities of the important indicators, such as epidemic trend, epidemic growth rate, and reproduction numbers. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to identify prevention and control policies that are effective in altering these indicators. Our analysis identified a noticeable inter-province variation in the epidemic trend (3 per day to 104 per day linear increase during third surge period), the median daily growth rate (1 to 4% per day exponential growth), the basic reproduction number (0.71 to 1.21), and the effective reproduction number (maximum values ranging from 1.20 to 2.86).

The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Potential epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 HLA class I families. Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations. AUTHOR SUMMARYThe cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.","output":"Predicted Impact of the Viral Mutational Landscape on the Cytotoxic Response against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With increasing age, functional connectomes become dissimilar across normal individuals, reflecting heterogenous aging effects on functional connectivity (FC).

With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.","output":"Role of dopamine and gray matter density in aging effects and individual differences of functional connectomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To understand the anti-virus adaptive immune response occurring during SARS-Cov-2 infection is necessary to have methods to investigate cellular and humoral components.

Surgery-related morbidity at 90 postoperative days (POD) based on the Clavien-Dindo procedure-related complication score and clinical outcome in terms of recurrence and reoperation rate at 12 postoperative months (POM) was collected. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were randomized according to HD grade. In the DGHAL arm, the number of ligations and mucopexies was higher in the AMI group (p < 0.0001); at 90 POD, the overall morbidity was similar between the two groups. In the CSH arm, donut sizes were similar; at 90 POD, the PPH group had a higher risk of postoperative grade 1 morbidity (anal urgency or incontinence) compared to the HEM group (p = 0.003). At 12 POM, no statistical difference was found between the two groups of each arm in terms of grade III recurrence or reoperation.

The commonest AEFI observed were injection site tenderness (n=198/263), fatigue (114/263), headache (n=107/263), and muscle pain (n=85/263). Females (AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.15, 6.58), and participants who felt the vaccine was unsafe (AOR=2.84, 95% CI: 1.03, 7.85) were having nearly three times more odds of AEFI immunization as compared to males and those who felt the vaccine was safe, respectively. CONCLUSION: Adverse event following immunization has been a public health problem in Northwest Ethiopia. Being female and having a feeling that the vaccine is unsafe were statistically significantly associated with AEFI.","output":"More Than Three-Fourths of AstraZeneca (ChAdox1 COV-19) COVID-19 Vaccinated Individuals Develop Post Immunization Adverse Event in Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we address the connection between population density centers in urban areas, and the nature of human flows between such centers, in shaping the vulnerability to the onset of contagious diseases. A study of 163 cities, chosen from four different continents reveals a universal trend, whereby the risk induced by human mobility increases in those cities where mobility flows are predominantly between high population density centers. We apply our formalism to the spread of SARS-COV-2 in the United States, providing a plausible explanation for the observed heterogeneity in the spreading process across cities. Armed with this insight, we propose realistic mitigation strategies (less severe than lockdowns), based on modifying the mobility in cities. Our results suggest that an optimal control strategy involves an asymmetric policy that restricts flows entering the most vulnerable areas but allowing residents to continue their usual mobility patterns.","output":"Interplay between intra-urban population density and mobility in determining the spread of epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) infection can have various abnormal hematologic parameters.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the human capital approach to estimate the DMVHL (assuming Spain's life expectancy of 83 years and a 3% discount rate) of the 20,453 human lives lost in Spain from COVID-19 as of 19 April 2020. Sensitivity analysis was conducted alternately assuming (a) 5% and 10% discount rate; and (b) global life expectancy of 72 years, and the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years. Findings: The 20,453 human lives lost due to COVID-19 had a total DMVHL of Int$ 9,629,234,112, and an average of Int$ 470,798 per human life lost. Alternate re-estimation of the economic model with a 5% and 10% discount rates led to 19.8% and 47.4% reductions in the DMVHL, respectively. Re-calculation of the economic model using the global life expectancy of 72 years, while holding the discount rate constant at 3%, diminished the DMVHL by 41%. While the re-run of the same model using the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years instead, it increased the DMVHL by 18%.

Objective: To evaluate the interferon (IFN)-&#945; levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients in relation to severity, evolution of the clinical manifestations and immune/inflammatory profile. Methods: This is prospective study recruiting consecutive hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with SARS-COV-2 infection and matched controls. After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7  2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. Results: Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN-&#945; were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, p < 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN-&#945; levels. A significant increase in blood IFN-&#945; was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population). A similar trend was found for blood IFN-? with IFN-? levels below the threshold of detectability in a substantial proportion of subjects. Significantly higher values of blood lymphocytes and lower levels of IL-10 were found at each time point in patients who survived compared to patients who died. In patients who clinically improved and survived during the study, we found an inverse association between IL-10 and IFN-&#945; levels. Conclusion: The study identifies a blood immune profile defined by deficient IFN-&#945; levels associated with increased IL-10 expression in patients progressing to severe/life threatening COVID-19 conditions, suggesting the involvement of immunological pathways that could be target of pharmacological intervention.

Two specific modifiable components included in the Israeli program from which the US can learn are (a) a national (not individual state-based) strategy for vaccine distribution and administration and (b) a functioning public health infrastructure. As a federal government, the US maintains an often complex web of state and national authorities and responsibilities. The federal government assumed responsibility for the ordering, payment and procurement of COVID vaccine from manufacturers. In designing the subsequent steps in their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration plan, the Trump administration decided to rely on the states themselves to determine how best to implement guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This strategy resulted in 50 different plans and 50 different systems for the dissemination of vaccine doses, all at the level of each individual state. State health departments were neither financed, experienced nor uniformly possessed the expertise to develop and implement such plans. A national strategy for the distribution, and the workforce for the provision, of vaccine beyond the state level, similar to that which occurred in Israel, would have provided for greater efficiency and coordination across the country. The US public health infrastructure was ill-prepared and ill-staffed to take on the responsibility to deliver > 450 million doses of vaccine in an expeditious fashion, even if supply of vaccine was available. The failure to adequately invest in public health has been ubiquitous across the nation at all levels of government. Since the 2008 recession, state and local health departments have lost > 38,000 jobs and spending for state public health departments has dropped by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments has fallen by 18%.

In addition, high-titer IGs (hyperimmune) against a specific pathogen can be obtained from vaccinated or convalescing donors. Currently, IGs can be used for the treatment of a variety of infections for which no specific therapy exists or that remain difficult to treat. Moreover, the recent pathogen outbreaks for which there is no approved treatment have renewed attention to the role of convalescent plasma and IGs. Areas covered: In this review, a historical perspective of the use of sera and IGs in humans as anti-infective agents (any viral, bacterial, parasitic infection), excluding immunodeficient patients, is presented from early development to the latest clinical studies. A Medline search was conducted to examine the peer-reviewed literature, with no date limits. Expert commentary: Human pooled plasma-derived IG products benefit from the polyclonal response of every individual donor and from the interindividual variability in such response. The trend to increased availability of vaccines for infectious diseases also opens new potential applications of hyperimmune IGs for emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g.: Ebola, Zika, Dengue), for the prevention and treatment in the general population, healthcare personnel and caregivers.","output":"Use of human immunoglobulins as an anti-infective treatment: the experience so far and their possible re-emerging role."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEACS) patients fail to activate the Emergency Medical System (EMS), with possible dramatic consequences. Prior studies focusing on barriers to EMS activation included patients with any acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without representation of southern European populations. We aimed to investigate the barriers to EMS call for patients diagnosed for STEACS in Italy. A prospective, single-center, survey administered to all patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEACS in a tertiary hospital in northern Italy from 01/06/2018 to 31/05/2020. The questionnaire was filled out by 293 patients. Of these, 191 (65.2%) activated the EMS after symptoms onset. The main reasons for failing to contact EMS were the perception that the symptoms were unrelated to an important health problem (45.5%) and that a private vehicle is faster than EMS to reach the hospital (34.7%). Patients who called a private doctor after symptoms onset did not call EMS more frequently than those who did not and 30% of the patients who did not call the EMS would still act in the same way if a new episode occurred. Previous history of cardiovascular disease was the only predictor of EMS call. Information campaigns are urgently needed to increase EMS activation in case of suspected STEACS and should be primary focused on patients without cardiovascular history, on the misperception that a private vehicle is faster than EMS activation, and on the fact that cardiac arrest occurs early and may be prevented by EMS activation.

This study compared the results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and a Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs a Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in thymine and adenine homopolymeric regions than the R9, at the expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than the RBK, and provided longer reads than the RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99 vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK preparation library provided longer DNA fragments which contributed to a better assembly of the SARS-CoV-2, despite an impaired detection of variants in a R10 flow cell. Nanopore sequencing could be used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. KEY POINTS: ? Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome is of great importance for the pandemic surveillance. ?

We use an unusually rich dataset which tracks the economic and financial transactions of sixty poor and very poor individuals and their families on a daily real-time basis for 12 months, from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020. These households for the past five years have volunteered as respondents in a financial diaries study known as the Hrishipara Daily Diaries Project. We use a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative case studies of five diarists with a quantitative analysis of the daily data extracted from the diaries. We document the behavioral responses to COVID-19 by individual diarists, which shows the varied experiences of the poor during the pandemic. Further, we find that the pandemic had significant negative effects on the livelihoods of the poor in our study, with financial inflows and outflows, incomes and household expenditures much below pre-pandemic levels in the pandemic period. Government lockdowns in April and May 2020 led to a sharp decline in incomes and household expenditures. While incomes and expenditures recovered in the post-lockdown period, they remained below pre-pandemic levels. Financial transactions such as borrowing, saving withdrawals and exchange of monetary gifts came to a standstill in the lockdown period, making it difficult for households to use conventional coping mechanisms in the face of a large unanticipated decline in incomes. Exploring the coping mechanisms that households used to adjust to the declines in incomes and their lack of access to formal and informal sources of finance, we find that households drew down on their cash reserves at home as well as cutting down on non-food expenditures to protect their spending on food.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the poor: Insights from the Hrishipara diaries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 main protease is one of the major targets in drug development efforts against Covid-19. Even though several structures were reported to date, its dynamics is not understood well. In particular, impact of dimerization and ligand binding on the dynamics is an important issue to investigate. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases to investigate influence of dimerization on the dynamics by modeling monomeric and dimeric apo and holo forms. The dimerization causes an organization of the interdomain dynamics as well as some local structural changes. Moreover, we investigated impact of a peptide mimetic (N3) on the dynamics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The ligand binding to the dimeric forms causes some key local changes at the dimer interface and it causes an allosteric interaction between the active sites of two protomers. Our results support the idea that only one protomer is active on SARS-CoV-2 due to this allosteric interaction. Additionally, we analyzed the molecular dynamics trajectories from graph theoretical perspective and found that the most influential residues - as measured by eigenvector centrality - are a group of residues in active site and dimeric interface of the protease. This study may form a bridge between what we know about the dynamics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) are good candidates for CO2 reduction because of their excellent photoelectric properties, including high molar extinction coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and defect tolerance. However, the pristine CsPbBr3 QDs generally have low photocatalytic performance mainly due to dominant charge recombination and lack of efficient catalytic sites for CO2 adsorption/activation. Herein, we report a new photocatalytic system, in which CsPbBr3 QDs are coupled with covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction.

AIMS: A rapid review was conducted to provide educators, allied health practitioners and policymakers with a synthesis of valid, relevant and actionable evidence relating to telepractice delivery of instructional reading and spelling procedures. The aim was to investigate the nature and outcomes of studies examining instructional reading and spelling procedures delivered via telepractice to school-aged students. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A rapid review was undertaken in accordance with the eight-step process published by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Medline (all databases), Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest Central were systematically searched with predefined search terms organized across four key concepts relating to the research questions. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this rapid review. Reading and spelling instruction and intervention using telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice assessment for reading and spelling can be equally effective as onsite assessment. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The evidence base for telepractice delivery of reading and spelling procedures is in its infancy in terms of both the quantity and the quality of the evidence. Insufficient evidence exists to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy, and therefore practitioners should proceed cautiously. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject For onsite delivery, evidence-based reading and spelling assessment, instruction and interventions delivered by educators and allied health practitioners have been shown to accelerate students' skills; less is known about the efficacy of instructional reading and spelling procedures in a telepractice model, which have rapidly become the new norm in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of telepractice include improved access to services, increased service availability, convenience, time efficiency, caseload management efficiency and removal of logistical barriers relating to cost and geographical location. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telepractice has facilitated continued access to services. What this study adds to existing knowledge Reading and spelling instruction and intervention delivered via telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice is a viable mode to deliver reading and spelling assessments with strong agreement between telepractice and onsite scores. Given their low methodological quality, the studies in this review provide valuable information around the how of telepractice reading and spelling procedures and highlight the factors that may contribute to positive outcomes with this service delivery model. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Educators and allied health practitioners need a thorough understanding of the student's telepractice environment and require adequate training and support to engage in telepractice service delivery. Educators and allied health practitioners should consider students for telepractice on a case-by-case basis. Practitioners should proceed cautiously with telepractice reading and spelling assessment, intervention and instruction, with the knowledge that the current available evidence is of limited quality.","output":"An evidence-based synthesis of instructional reading and spelling procedures using telepractice: A rapid review in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause different symptoms, from mild cold to severe respiratory distress, and they can be seen in different types of animals such as camels, cattle, cats and bats Novel coronavirus called COVID-19 is a newly emerged virus that appeared in many countries of the world, but the actual source of the virus is not yet known The outbreak has caused pandemic with 26,622,706 confirmed infections and 874,708 reported deaths worldwide till August 31, 2020, with 17,717,911 recovered cases Currently, there exist no vaccines officially approved for the prevention or management of the disease, but alternative drugs meant for HIV, HBV, malaria and some other flus are used to treat this virus In the present paper, a fractional-order epidemic model with two different operators called the classical Caputo operator and the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator for the transmission of COVID-19 epidemic is proposed and analyzed The reproduction number R0 is obtained for the prediction and persistence of the disease The dynamic behavior of the equilibria is studied by using fractional Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion and fractional La Salle invariant principle Special attention is given to the global dynamics of the equilibria Moreover, the fitting of parameters through least squares curve fitting technique is performed, and the average absolute relative error between COVID-19 actual cases and the model's solution for the infectious class is tried to be reduced and the best fitted values of the relevant parameters are achieved The numerical solution of the proposed COVID-19 fractional-order model under the Caputo operator is obtained by using generalized Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method, whereas for the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator, we have used a new numerical scheme Also, the treatment compartment is included in the population which determines the impact of alternative drugs applied for treating the infected individuals Furthermore, numerical simulations of the model and their graphical presentations are performed to visualize the effectiveness of our theoretical results and to monitor the effect of arbitrary-order derivative","output":"Modeling and analysis of COVID-19 epidemics with treatment in fractional derivatives using real data from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic HIV infection causes systemic immune activation and dysregulation, resulting in the impairment of most T-cell subsets including MAIT cells.

The aim of this study was to determine whether combining FIT with routine blood test results could improve the performance of FIT in the primary care setting. METHODS: Results of all consecutive FITs requested by primary care providers between March 2017 and December 2020 were retrieved from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Demographic factors (age, sex), reason for referral, and results of blood tests within 90 days were also retrieved. Patients were followed up for incident colorectal cancer in linked hospital records. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of FIT alone, FIT paired with blood test results, and several multivariable FIT models, were compared. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine colorectal cancers were diagnosed (0.8%). Sensitivity and specificity of FIT alone at a threshold of 10 g Hb/g were 92.1 and 91.5% respectively. Compared to FIT alone, blood test results did not improve the performance of FIT. Pairing blood test results with FIT increased specificity but decreased sensitivity. Multivariable models including blood tests performed similarly to FIT alone.

These rules can enhance the psychological mechanisms resulting from fear of contamination and may lead to exacerbating prejudiced attitudes towards certain social groups seen as possible carriers of infection. Fear of infection and ideas about cleanliness and dirtiness have indeed historically and culturally influenced the way we interact with other people, both on an inter-personal and inter-group level. The aim of the present research is to analyse whether the concern about COVID-19 is linked to prejudices towards other social groups and whether this relationship is mediated by individual representations of cleanliness. Results on 251 Italian citizens showed that concerns about COVID-19 are positively related to prejudicial attitudes towards immigrants and that such a relation is indeed mediated by so-called cultural representations of cleanliness. Specifically, the so-called cultural representations of hygiene-by which people and groups are categorized as being more or less civilized on the basis of their cleaning practices-was a significant mediator.

A specific adaptation of the Shewhart p-chart, called a funnel chart, was used to compare case fatality rates. Important differences in case fatality rates across the counties did not appear to be reflective of differences in testing or incidence rates. Instead, a higher prevalence of comorbidities and vulnerabilities was observed in high fatality rate counties, while showing no differences in access to acute care. Funnel charts reliably identify counties with unexpected high and low COVID-19 case fatality rates. Social determinants of health are strongly associated with such differences.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity (PA) trajectory over the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the south of Brazil. METHODS: Data from three timepoints of the PAMPA Cohort were used, as follows: (1) pre-COVID-19 (retrospective); (2) Jun/Jul 2020; (3) Dec 2020/Jan 2021. Self-reported PA practice, frequency, duration, as well as place where activities were performed (at or out of home) were assessed. RESULTS: A reduction in any (from 68.7 to 47.7%), sufficient (from 41.5 to 22.1%) and out of home PA (from 59.4 to 30.1%) was observed from the first (pre-COVID-19) to the second (Jun/Jul 2020) timepoint, followed by an increase in the third timepoint (Dec 2020/Jan 2021) (60.1%, 37.9%, and 54.3% for any, sufficient, and out of home PA, respectively). The PA trajectory was similar, regardless of sex, educational level or income. Only any (p = 0.0007) and sufficient (p = 0.0012) PA showed significant interaction with time by sex. Female participants were less likely to engage in any (OR 0.45 95% CI 0.26; 0.77) and sufficient PA (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.24; 0.66).

To foster a supportive community where such concerns may be addressed, residents can be educated in identification and first-line support of burnout in fellow residents. The literature has not described peer roleplaying applied toward aiding fellow residents with burnout. METHOD: This pilot study evaluated an educational component aimed at fostering a strong emotional and informational social support system. The curriculum used peer roleplaying to develop self-awareness and social support, improve communication skills, and teach about existing mental health resources, thereby encouraging intervention. Residents listed behavioral manifestations of burnout and dysphoria that we developed into real-life scenarios. During experiential workshops, residents roleplayed distressed and helper residents and practiced communicating empathy. To tackle mental health stigma, all were required to practice expressing distress and seeking help. Residents completed a pre-roleplaying questionnaire, curriculum satisfaction questionnaire, and reflection essay. RESULTS: All 42 Internal Medicine and Transitional Year residents (69% male, 93% international medical graduates) participated. Resident-reported comfort, competence, confidence, and knowledge increased, as did positive appraisals of the clinical teaching environment representing a safe atmosphere. Six themes were cited in >25% of essays: knowledge of communication techniques, knowledge of approach tactics or strategies, knowledge of hospital resources, commitment to helping colleagues, importance of burnout, and belief this training produced a better understanding of oneself. CONCLUSION: As first-witnesses of resident physician distress, peers occupy an underutilized, yet crucial preventive and supportive role in burnout and mental health intervention, especially during times of shared crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. Creating roleplays from personal experiences facilitated meaningful discussion of burnout and dysphoric emotions. Roleplaying offered a low-cost, effective method to destigmatize and encourage discussion of burnout, educate on signs and symptoms, and learn available resources to offer an afflicted colleague in osteopathic and allopathic residency programs.","output":"Encouraging a Little Help from Our Friends: Resident Physician Burnout & Peer Communication Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research article focuses on the ecological operation of accommodation services in Bulgaria. The aim of this article is to evaluate the application of various green management elements and measures in selected hotels in Bulgaria, namely in the cities of Sofia and Varna. The research will pay attention to the implementation of individual green measures in hotel operations as well as a comparison between hotel categories and hotels in the two cities in terms of the application of green measures. Running an environmentally friendly hotel can have several positive effects, it significantly manifests itself in the area of marketing - it creates an image, has an effect on current and prospective guests, and defines the positioning of the hotel. It also impacts the economic and operational aspects, with ecological elements having the potential to reduce hotels' operating costs. The societal impact of running hotels in an environmentally friendly fashion lies in resource conservation and ensuring environmental sustainability. This research was carried out using mixed research methods, combining semi-structured interviews with hotel management staff in Varna (n = 90) and Sofia (n = 96). The total sample of participating hotels represented 81.6% of hotels in the two cities. The interviews were complemented with a questionnaire survey, which focused on the application of environmentally friendly solutions in hotel operations. In the data analysis stage, the methods of correspondence analysis, the ANOVA test and the Kru?kal-Wallis test were used. The results suggest that the higher the hotel category, the stronger the trend to use environmentally friendly methods in running hotels. The research also found that there were differences between the level at which green measures were applied in hotel operations in the two cities.

In nations with aging populations, ensuring equitable use of health check-ups by senior citizens is a public health concern. The objective of this research was to quantify income-related inequality and its effect on the use of health checkup services in Taiwan during the 2007C2008 global financial crisis. We used the 2005 and 2009 datasets of the Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys to assess how income-related inequality influenced health check-up use among older adults in Taiwan during the 2007C2008 financial crisis. Corrected concentration indices (CCIs) were calculated and decomposed to determine the influences of explanatory variables. The dependent variable was whether participants had used free senior health check-ups in the past year, and the determinant factors were health behavior, health situation, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and area health care resources accessibility factors. The study assessed 2,460 older adults from the 2005 dataset and 2,514 such individuals from the 2009 dataset. The utilization of health check-ups increased from 21.6% in 2005 to 34.0% in 2009. Income-related inequality in the use of health check-up services was generally tilted toward the higher income individuals among both women and men in 2005 and 2009, and income-related inequality decreased among women group and increased among men group with non significantly from 2005 to 2009 (women: CCI decreased from.0738 in 2005 to.0658 in 2009; men: CCI increased from.1068 in 2005 to.1256 in 2009). We analyzed the effect of explanatory factors on mens and womens intention to use health check-ups by using a probit model. After controlling for other factors, we determined that income significantly influenced womens health check-up service use in 2005 and mens in 2005 and 2009. Positive health behavior significantly increased health check-up services use among men and women group after the financial crisis, and negative health behavior significantly reduced health check-ups use among men across financial crisis. The 2008 global financial crisis strengthened the effect on health check-ups use of income-related inequality of elderly men, especially in older adults with negative health behaviors. Elderly men with negative health behaviors tended to contribute more income-related inequality in use health check-up services after the financial crisis.

Autoregulation can be monitored in real time with transcranial Doppler (TCD). We have previously demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rS(c)O(2)) provides a clinically suitable surrogate of CBF for autoregulation monitoring. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a stand-alone \\"plug-and-play\\" investigational system for autoregulation monitoring that uses a commercially available NIRS monitor with TCD methods. METHODS TCD monitoring of middle cerebral artery CBF velocity and NIRS monitoring were performed in 70 patients during CPB. Indices of autoregulation were computed by both a personal computer-based system and an investigational prototype NIRS-based monitor. A moving linear correlation coefficient between slow waves of ABP and CBF velocity (mean velocity index [Mx]) and between ABP and rS(c)O(2) (cerebral oximetry index [COx]) were calculated. When CBF is autoregulated, there is no correlation between CBF and ABP; when CBF is dysregulated, Mx and COx approach 1 (i.e., CBF and ABP are correlated). Linear regression and bias analysis were performed between time-averaged values of Mx and COx derived from the personal computer-based system and from COx measured with the prototype monitor. Values for Mx and COx were categorized in 5 mm Hg bins of ABP for each patient. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was defined as the ABP where Mx incrementally increased to 0.4. RESULTS There was correlation and good agreement between COx derived from the prototype monitor and Mx (r = 0.510; 95% confidence interval, 0.414-0.595; P < 0.001; bias, -0.07  0.19). The correlation and bias between the personal computer-based COx and the COx from the prototype NIRS monitor were r = 0.957 (95% confidence interval, 0.945-0.966; P < 0.001 and 0.06  0.06, respectively). The average ABP at the lower limit of autoregulation was 63  11 mm Hg (95% prediction interval, 52-74 mm Hg). Although the mean ABP at the COx-determined lower limit of autoregulation determined with the prototype monitor was statistically different from that determined by Mx (59  9 mm Hg; 95% prediction interval, 50-68 mm Hg; P = 0.026), the difference was not likely clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring CBF autoregulation with an investigational stand-alone NIRS monitor is correlated and in good agreement with TCD-based methods. The availability of such a device would allow widespread autoregulation monitoring as a means of individualizing ABP targets during CPB.","output":"Validation of a stand-alone near-infrared spectroscopy system for monitoring cerebral autoregulation during cardiac surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world, hospitals have played a major role in managing the crisis;therefore, the hospital's readiness to continue medical care in the crisis of COVID-19 has particular importance to communities The aim of the current study was to determine the readiness of hospitals in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran in the COVID-19 crisis Methods: This is a cross-sectional study and the research population includes all hospitals in Sistan and Baluchestan province, which includes 24 hospitals The data collection tool was the Comprehensive Hospital Preparedness Checklist for COVID-19, which was translated and validated Data were collected by sending an online questionnaire to the province's hospitals Results: The average score obtained out of 100 in the hospital readiness checklist for COVID-19;in the general information part was 36, the structure for planning and decision making was 53 3, development of a written COVID-19 plan was 40 9, elements of a COVID-19 plan was 46 7, facility communications were 15, consumables and durable medical equipment and supplies were 37 9, identification and management of ill patients were 54 2, visitor access and movement within the facility was 33 3, occupational health was 30 7, education and training was 49 and healthcare services/surge capacity was 19 1 The average total hospital readiness score for COVID-19 was 40 12, which is classified as weak Conclusion: The hospitals of Sistan and Baluchestan province received the lowest level of readiness in facility communications among other items of hospital readiness This indicates that these hospitals are not ready to cooperate and coordinate with each other, and this slows down the process of fighting with COVID-19 in the province The low amount of healthcare services/surge capacity at the peak of COVID-19 is one of the reasons in which the province's hospitals have not been able to perform well, therefore, it is necessary for the authorities to pay attention to this issue and create serious and quick solutions to increase the readiness of the hospitals in this field in order to reduce casualties and further harm of the society ? 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences All rights reserved","output":"Investigating the readiness of hospitals in Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Crisis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of palliative breast radiation therapy (RT), with single fraction RT compared with fractionated RT.

All of these data were collected in 140 countries at six time points. Correlations were studied using univariate and multivariate regression models. The world was interpreted as a single global ecosystem consisting of ecosystem units representing countries. We first studied 140 countries around the world together, and infection rates were related to per capita GDP, Ecological Footprint, median age, urban population, and Biological Capacity, globally. We then ranked the 140 countries according to infection rates. We created four groups with 35 countries each. In the first group of countries, the infection rate was very high and correlated with the Ecological Footprint (consumption) and GDP per capita (production). This group is dominated by developed countries, and their ecological conditions have proved to be particularly significant. In country groups 2, 3, and 4, infection rates were high, medium, and low, respectively, and were mainly related to median age and urban population. In the scientific discussion, we have interpreted why infection rates are very high in developed countries. Sustainable ecosystems are balanced, unlike the ecosystems of developed countries. The resilience and the health of both natural ecosystems and humans are closely linked to the world of microbial communities, the microbiomes of the biosphere.

Yet, the socio-contextual determinants of a biopsychosocial phenomenon as sleep are poorly investigated. We examine changes concomitantly occurring in the child's sleep per familial and community stressors. Methods During the pre-COVID-19 outbreak period, in 24 minority children (5.41.7 years old, 54.2% girls), sleep was objectively measured 24-hours for two consecutive weeks, and this was repeated three times over the study period of three months. The caregiver filled out questionnaires surveying sociodemographic, community and family aspects. Results Children went to bed at 22:26 and woke up at 07:04, with each a variability of about 50 minutes. Money and time were revealed as related key stressors to sleep. Five dimensions best fitted their association. In general, concurrent changes within the individual child indicate that mean sleep variables seem to relate to predominantly features of the stressors (explained variance of 34.7% to 56.7%), while variability of sleep tends to associate to situational aspects of the stressors (explained variance of 30.4% to 61.8%). Associations were best explained in terms of the 24-hour dimension, particularly exposing sleep variability. Conclusion Individual variabilities in a child's sleep are associated with familial resources, such as caregiver's time to self, money and basic needs. Time spent in bed, a modifiable factor by society and shaper of sleep quantity and quality, plays a key role in stressor-sleep associations.

Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can withstand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is a dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organising a scoping review aiming to explore the application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and O'Malley. Peer-reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled using a standardised and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the WHO's Global Research Database on COVID-19 and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full-text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrix. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June 2020 to May 2021. Results from this scoping review will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed article and will assist policy-makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic responses.","output":"Evidence of integrated health service delivery during COVID-19 in low and lower-middle-income countries: protocol for a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the world causing acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. For SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study, we show that S can be cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2' site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 in human airway cells. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with furin inhibitor MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. Therefore, this approach has considerable therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","output":"TMPRSS2 and furin are both essential for proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While receiving treatment for COVID-19, Mr G, age 56, experiences an acute psychotic episode He has no known psychiatric history What could be causing his symptoms? ? 2020 Quadrant Healthcom Inc All rights reserved","output":"New-onset psychosis while being treated for coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a new phenomenon reported worldwide with temporal association with Covid-19.

Using age-standardized death rates, we attribute changes for Black, Hispanic, and White populations to various underlying causes of death and show how these racial and ethnic patterns vary by age and sex. We find that although Covid-19 death rates in 2020 were highest in the Hispanic community, Black individuals faced the largest increase in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020. Exceptionally large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death accounted for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population. Within Black and White populations, percentage increases in all-cause mortality were similar for men and women, as well as for ages 25C64 and 65+. Among the Hispanic population, however, percentage increases in mortality were greatest for working-aged men.

We evaluated combination of mutations from SARS-CoV-2 lineages and found that maximum number of lineage-defining mutations were present in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Based on mutant 3D-structural models of known Variants of Concern (VOCs), we found that structural properties such as accessibility, secondary structural type, and intra-protein interactions at local mutation sites are greatly altered. Further, we observed significant differences between intra-protein networks of wild-type and Delta mutant, with the latter showing dense intra-protein contacts. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of D614G mutant spike structure with hACE2 further revealed dynamic features with 47.7% of mutations mapping on flexible regions of spike protein. Thus, we propose that significant changes within spike protein structure have occurred that may impact SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and repositioning of vaccine candidates is required to contain the spread of COVID-19 pathogen.","output":"A rigorous framework for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutational ensemble from genomic and structural features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon-lambda (IFN-) is a recently described cytokine found to be of critical importance in innate immune regulation of intestinal viruses.

Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a better clinical trial information retrieval that supports searching by specifying criteria including both eligibility criteria and structured trial information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding. RESULTS: The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information. We observed clustering in clinical trials via graph embedding, which also showed superiority over the baseline (0.8704 vs. 0.8199) in evaluating whether a trial can complete its recruitment successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Trial Graph is a novel representation of clinical trials that allows diverse search queries and provides a graph-based visualization of COVID-19 clinical trials.

Recently in silico studies have indicated that phytochemicals present in olive oil are a potential candidate to act against SARS-CoV-2. Although extensive studies on olive oil and its phytochemical composition; still, some lacunas persist in understanding how the phytochemical composition of olive oil is dependent on upstream processing. The signaling pathways regulated by olive oil in the restriction of various diseases is also not clear. To answer these queries, a detailed search of research and review articles published between 1990 to 2019 were reviewed in this effect. Olive oil consumption was found to be advantageous for various chronic non-communicable diseases. Olive oil's constituents are having potent anti-inflammatory activities and thus restrict the progression of various inflammation-linked diseases ranging from arthritis to cancer. But it is also notable that the amount and nature of phytochemical composition of household olive oil are regulated by its upstream processing and the physicochemical properties of this oil can give a hint regarding the manufacturing method as well as its therapeutic. Moreover, daily uptake of olive oil should be monitored as excessive intake can cause body weight gain and change in the basal metabolic index.

METHODS AND RESULTS This was a non-industry-funded, prospective academic study in all-referrals-tracked symptomatic and asymptomatic CS. In asymptomatic lesions, intervention was mandated only in case of increased stroke risk CS features. There was independent neurologist evaluation before CAS, at 48 hours and 30 days. There was external source data verification, angiographic core lab, and statistical analysis. Over 11 months, 108 referrals were recommended by the NeuroVascular Team for revascularisation: 101 (51-86 years, 55 symptomatic, evolving stroke in nine) underwent 106 (100% MN-EPS use) neuroprotection device-assisted (46% proximal, 54% distal) CAS; CEA was performed in seven. MN-EPS device success was 99.1%. Angiographic diameter stenosis was reduced from 839% to 6.75% (p<0.001). No MN-EPS foreshortening/elongation occurred (30 mm long was 29.820.68 mm; 40 mm long was 39.890.59 mm). The periprocedural death/major stroke/MI rate was 0%.

Final test results and Ct changes were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 17 of 20 specimens that contained SARS-CoV-2 were detected after 10:1 pooling with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Cepheid), rendering an 85% positive percentage of agreement.

METHOD: A quantitative research was developed through a simple random sampling in different Spanish hospitals through the period of greatest impact of the pandemic (N = 157). Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire from Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) containing 22 items, which measures three subscales: emotional burnout, depersonalization, and self-fulfillment. RESULTS: depersonalization values reached 38.9%. A total of 90.4% of the health professionals considered that psychological care should be provided from the work centers. Furthermore, 43.3% of the health professionals estimated that they might need psychological treatment in the future. Finally, 85.4% stated that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) generated an increase in stress and anxiety.

This study investigated IPC generation from two practical canine mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs), canine bone marrow-derived MSCs (cBM-MSCs) and canine adipose-derived MSCs (cAD-MSCs). The results illustrated that cBM-MSCs and cAD-MSCs contain distinct pancreatic differentiation potential and require the tailor-made induction protocols. The effective generation of cBM-MSC-derived IPCs needs the integration of genetic and microenvironment manipulation using a hanging-drop culture of PDX1-transfected cBM-MSCs under a three-step pancreatic induction protocol. However, this protocol is resource- and time-consuming. Another study on cAD-MSC-derived IPC generation found that IPC colonies could be obtained by a low attachment culture under the three-step induction protocol.

The super-wet and tumescent techniques are used most frequently. Both serve to reduce collateral blood loss, facilitate the suctioning procedure, and providing local anesthesia. Overall, liposuction is considered safe and effective, with minor adverse effects such as swelling, minute bleeding, contour irregularities, and seroma. Serious complication such as life-threatening bleeding are rare. In this case report, we present a patient with significant postoperative bleeding following minor-to-moderate liposuction performed at a day surgery center. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old healthy man, 4 days after 1600-cc aspirate tumescent liposuction performed in a day surgery center, was admitted to our ward with tachycardia, weakness, abdominal pain and disseminated hematoma. On admission, laboratory testing showed hematocrit of 20.9% and hemoglobin of 6.9 gr/dl. Immediate abdominal CT angiography was performed to exclude active bleeding, showing diffused hematoma in the subcutaneous fat all over the abdomen and scrotum, with some edema without active bleeding. The patient was treated with blood transfusion to facilitate fast home discharge during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic that time. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the common work-up and treatment of postoperative hemorrhage. Blood transfusion following minor-to-moderate liposuction is unusual but during the COVID-19 pandemic it can facilitate quick discharge of a patient with postoperative hemorrhage with no active bleeding. Improper patient selection, an inexperienced surgeon, and inadequate operating locale can all result in postoperative complications. We call for the formulation of more detailed guidelines for liposuction setting.","output":"Severe Postoperative Bleeding Following Minor-to-Moderate Abdominal and Flank Liposuction Performed at a Day Surgery Center: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an unprecedented threat for individuals and societies, revealing stark inequalities in preparedness, exposure, and consequences.

This research investigates the social responsiveness (CSR(2)) approaches implemented by credit unions during the pandemic, the type of actions implemented, the stakeholders assisted, and whether the size of credit unions may affect their responses. Data were collected from the 100 largest credit unions from nine Canadian provinces and assessed through qualitative content analysis. Results show that Canadian credit unions have implemented accommodative and proactive approaches when addressing COVID\\\\19, through more operational than financial actions directed to their clients and employees, and that those with larger assets implement a greater number of actions compared to credit unions with smaller assets. More importantly, results show that traditional CSR(2) approaches (e.g., RDAP) do not fit unexpected crises, so novel approaches are required to face future crises and remain resilient. While we aim to contribute to the body of literature by examining how credit unions have assisted their stakeholders during the pandemic, we also, and most importantly, seek to provide material for discussing and reflecting on how organizations are prepared to face crises that will likely arise in the future.","output":"COVID\\\\19 and credit unions: CSR approaches to navigating the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper describes the interaction between vibration modes associated with the machine-spindle and those associated with the holder-tool when the holder-tool combination is inserted in the milling machine spindle.

Methods Seventy-two patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV from multiple medical centers in western China were retrospectively analyzed, including epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and HRCT chest features. Results All patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on HRCT scans, which were mostly multifocal in both lungs and asymmetric in all patients, and were mostly in the peripheral or subpleural lung regions in 52 patients (72.22%), in the central lung regions in 16 patients (22.22%), and in both lungs with \\"white lung\\" manifestations in 4 patients (5.56%). Subpleural multifocal consolidation was a predominant abnormality in 38 patients (52.78%). Ground-glass opacity was seen in 34 patients (47.22%). Interlobular septal thickening was found in 18 patients, 8 of whom had only generally mild thickening with no zonal predominance. Reticulation was seen in 8 patients (11.11%), and was mild and randomly distributed. In addition, both lungs of 28 patients had 2 or 3 CT imaging features.

It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies.

A piecewise linear random-effects multivariate regression analysis showed a bi-phasic antibody decay with a more pronounced decrease during the first 6 months post symptoms onset by analysis of two intervals. Interestingly, antibodies to Spike showed better longevity whereas their neutralization ability contracted faster. As a result, neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 76% of patients at the last time point. In a multivariate analysis, older age and hospitalization were independently associated with higher Spike, Spike-RBD, Nucleocapsid, N-RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibody levels. Results on persistence and neutralizing ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially against Spike and Spike-RBD, should be considered in the design of future vaccination strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics eight months from COVID-19 onset: Persistence of spike antibodies but loss of neutralizing antibodies in 24% of convalescent plasma donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Suicide rates among Ethiopian immigrants to Israel (EI) are relatively high. This study sought to identify suicide-risk factors in this population in order to suggest some potentially preventive measures to mental health policymakers who are struggling to prevent suicide among EI. METHOD: Nationwide age-adjusted suicide rates were calculated for EI, Former Soviet Union immigrants (FSUI) and Israeli-born (IB) Jews by age, gender, and year of death and, for EI, by marital status and immigration period in the years 1985C2017 (1990C2017 for FSUI). RESULTS: Age-adjusted suicide rates for the period 1990C2017 confirmed the significantly higher rate among EICC3.1 times higher than for FSUI and 4.1 times higher than for IB. Similar rates were obtained for both genders, within each age group, and in all study years. Comparable male/female rate ratios were found among EI and IB (3.3, 3.6, respectively). Over the years of the study, only among the Ethiopian immigrants were there large fluctuations in suicide rates: a decrease (1992C2001), followed by an increase (2001C2006), and then a progressive decrease (from 2006). The secular changes differed greatly according to age. Among females, these fluctuations were smaller, the decrease began earlier and was greater, and the subsequent increase was much smaller. Marriage was found to be less protective for Ethiopian immigrants than for the other surveyed populations. CONCLUSIONS: The considerable gap between the EIs and FSUIs suicide rates highlights the critical role of immigrants integration difficulties. These difficulties among EI lead to ongoing conflict within the family, which may explain why marriage is less protective for EI. Nevertheless, progressive integration is occurring as indicated by the decline in suicide rates since 2006. The fluctuations in EI suicide rates over time seem to be associated with modifications in social welfare allowances, which are crucial for EI of low socioeconomic status. Groups at risk, particularly EI men facing socioeconomic challenges and EI with considerable family conflict, typically identified by HMOs and welfare services, should be screened for suicide risk, and those identified as at risk referred to tailored workshops sensitive to Ethiopian culture.","output":"Suicide rates and risk factors for suicide among Israeli immigrants from Ethiopia (1985C2017)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuous assessment of the effectiveness of approved COVID-19 vaccines is crucial to gain an insight into the longer-term impact on health outcomes, and eventually boosting public confidence. For this reason, we conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using data on infection and vaccination rates among employees of three Prague hospitals in the period between 27 December 2020 and 31 August 2021. The post-vaccination and post-infection protectiveness were assessed in a total of 11,443 hospital workers who were followed up for more than 14 days either after their Comirnaty vaccination or study enrolment, depending on their previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effectiveness of full vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection achieved 88.3% (83.2C91.8%) over the eight months of follow-up, a figure not much different from the 92.5% (76.5C97.6%) level of protection built by a previous infection. Despite this, the post-vaccination level of protection declined to about 65% between June and August. No case of breakthrough infection was registered among hospital workers having received one or two vaccine doses more than three months after previous infection. The eight-month effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine exhibited a declining trend requiring a new booster dose.

The United States has been severely affected, accounting for the most COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. Without a coordinated national public health plan informed by surveillance with actionable metrics, the United States has been ineffective at preventing and mitigating the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance has incomplete ascertainment and is limited by the use of standard surveillance metrics. Although many COVID-19 data sources track infection rates, informing prevention requires capturing the relevant dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop dynamic metrics for public health surveillance that can inform worldwide COVID-19 prevention efforts. Advanced surveillance techniques are essential to inform public health decision making and to identify where and when corrective action is required to prevent outbreaks. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted COVID-19 data from global public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers for our use case in 50 US states and the District of Colombia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Examination of the United States and state data demonstrated that most US states are experiencing outbreaks as measured by these new metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Larger US states have high COVID-19 caseloads as a function of population size, density, and deficits in adherence to public health guidelines early in the epidemic, and other states have alarming rates of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence in novel infections. North and South Dakota have had the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission combined with positive acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence. Wisconsin and Illinois also have alarming indicators and already lead the nation in daily new COVID-19 infections. As the United States enters its third wave of COVID-19, all 50 states and the District of Colombia have positive rates of speed between 7.58 (Hawaii) and 175.01 (North Dakota), and persistence, ranging from 4.44 (Vermont) to 195.35 (North Dakota) new infections per 100,000 people. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance techniques such as daily and cumulative infections and deaths are helpful but only provide a static view of what has already occurred in the pandemic and are less helpful in prevention. Public health policy that is informed by dynamic surveillance can shift the country from reacting to COVID-19 transmissions to being proactive and taking corrective action when indicators of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence remain positive week over week. Implicit within our dynamic surveillance is an early warning system that indicates when there is problematic growth in COVID-19 transmissions as well as signals when growth will become explosive without action. A public health approach that focuses on prevention can prevent major outbreaks in addition to endorsing effective public health policies. Moreover, subnational analyses on the dynamics of the pandemic allow us to zero in on where transmissions are increasing, meaning corrective action can be applied with precision in problematic areas. Dynamic public health surveillance can inform specific geographies where quarantines are necessary while preserving the economy in other US areas.","output":"Dynamic Public Health Surveillance to Track and Mitigate the US COVID-19 Epidemic: Longitudinal Trend Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of an effective vaccine requires a long and complicated process.

It seems only right that she, and other blind people who enjoy this privilege, have a responsibility to share the experience as a way to expand cultural knowledge about art. The projects described here enable her to begin to establish a taxonomy and vocabulary of tactile and haptic aesthetics, and model tactile descriptions of art that can benefit anyone.

Different subsets carry out different functions and have been previously associated with multiple inflammatory conditions. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and poor reproducibility. Publicly available transcriptome profiles provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real-world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in cell levels. Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures maintain their accuracy regardless of disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing and are specific to their respective subset when compared to other immune cells from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages profiled across 6160 transcriptome profiles. Consequently, we show that these signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets.

We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively).

RESULTS: Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-&#945;2a, rIFN-&#945;2b, or rIFN-?1a; none received rIFN-?1b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73-1.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30-1.44]; P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-&#945;2a, rIFN-&#945;2b, or rIFN-?1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.","output":"Ribavirin and Interferon Therapy for Critically Ill Patients With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Multicenter Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While facial coverings over the nose and mouth reduce the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 by filtration, masks capable of viral inactivation by heating could provide a complementary method to limit viral transmission.

BACKGROUND The association between hemorrhagic complications and mortality may explain the survival benefit with bivalirudin. METHODS A total of 3,602 STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were randomized to bivalirudin versus UFH+GPI. Three-year cardiac mortality was analyzed in patients with and without major bleeding. RESULTS When compared with UFH+GPI, bivalirudin resulted in lower 3-year rates of major bleeding (6.9% vs. 10.5%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51 to 0.80], p < 0.0001) and cardiac mortality (2.9% vs. 5.1%, HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.40 to 0.80], p = 0.001). Three-year cardiac mortality was reduced in bivalirudin-treated patients with major bleeding (20 fewer deaths with bivalirudin; 5.8% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.025) and without major bleeding (18 fewer deaths with bivalirudin; 2.6% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.048). In a fully-adjusted multivariable model accounting for major bleeding and other adverse events, bivalirudin was still associated with a 43% reduction in 3-year cardiac mortality (adjusted HR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.39 to 0.83], p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin reduces cardiac mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, an effect that can only partly be attributed to prevention of bleeding.

The highest mortality rate is observed among the older adult population. During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). The control group comprises 106 individuals with hip fractures who were admitted in the respective time periods during the previous 2 years, that is, March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, and March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. The facility's occupancy rates were much lower during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with previous years (78 and 99%, respectively). Patients showed similar demographics and comorbidities, but the social isolation group was more severely deconditioned upon admission. All rehabilitation outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION According to the findings of this retrospective study, social isolation from family and caregivers did not have a detrimental effect on the rehabilitation outcomes of these patients.

The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.","output":"How COVID-19 Has Globalized: Unknown Origin, Rapid Transmission, and the Immune System Nourishment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this chapter is to review the various considerations necessary to safely perform gynecologic surgery in the setting of a viral pandemic.

We present an overview of local experience with dialysis unit management and reorganisation, local epidemiology and outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak in Geneva, Switzerland, where SARS-CoV-2 incidence was one of the highest in Europe. METHODS All SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients on maintenance dialysis were transferred from their usual dialysis facility to the Geneva University Hospitals dialysis unit to avoid creation of new clusters of transmission. Within this unit, appropriate mitigation measures were enforced, as suggested by the institutional team for prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS From 25 February to 31 December 2020, 82 of 279 patients on maintenance dialysis tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during two distinct waves, with an incidence rate of 73 cases per 100,000 person-days during the first wave and 342 cases per 100,000 during the second wave, approximately four- to six-fold higher than the general population. The majority of infections (55%) during both waves were traced to clusters. Most infections (62%) occurred in men. Sixteen patients (34%) died from COVID-19 related complications. Deceased patients were older and had a lower body mass index as compared with patients who survived the infection. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high infection and fatality rates in the dialysis population. Strict mitigation measures seemed to be effective in controlling infection spread among patients on maintenance dialysis outside of clusters.

Twenty-four healthy volunteers received either 2  40 mg intravenous dexamethasone or placebo. These doses were administered 12 h apart prior to bronchoscopy-guided intrabronchial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (control: saline into the contralateral lung segment). We quantified ACE2 concentration, the Angiotensin-II-to-Angiotensin-1-7 conversion rate as well as FDP in BALF 6 h after LPS instillation. In placebo-treated subjects, LPS instillation increased ACE2 concentrations compared to unstimulated lung segments [1,481 (IQR: 736C1,965) vs. 546 (413C988) pg/mL; p = 0.016]. Dexamethasone abolished the increase in ACE2 concentrations (p=0.13).

As a vulnerable population, university students are at high risk during the epidemic, as they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease because they receive incomplete information about the epidemic. In addition to the risk of death from infection, the epidemic has placed substantial psychological pressure on the public. In this respect, university students are more prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population because for most students, university life is their first time outside the structure of the family, and their mental development is still immature. Internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure on students, and unhealthy lifestyles also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this study was to investigate the influencing factors of the psychological responses of Chinese university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study used data from a survey conducted in China between February 21 and 24, 2020, and the data set contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the compulsive behaviors portion of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A total of 2284 questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them were valid and were used for analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 nonmedical students. Among them, 251/2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.363, P=.02), past medical history (OR 3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR 3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health issues.

In this study, we sought to investigate whether smoking could be an additional risk factor for hand eczema in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Using a questionnaire about smoking details and hand eczema, we conducted a study among nurses involved in the frontline management of COVID-19 patients. A total of 1,000 questionnaires were sent out. The questionnaires were anonymous and based on self-reported answers, with no clinical examination or medical data evaluation. All nurses enrolled in the study were women, working in shifts for the last three months since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Two-hundred forty-seven questionnaires were accepted for the study, after eliminating non-responders and nurses without hand eczema. The majority of nurses denied smoking (87.85%) in the past and at the moment of the study. Statistics related to years of smoking and occurrence of hand eczema showed no increase in the number of cases in correlation with the number of years of smoking. Similarly, a random distribution of cases of hand eczema was observed when compared to the number of cigarettes per day. Conclusion: Our data does not support the hypothesis that smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of occupational hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Smoking Habit and Correlation with Hand Eczema in Healthcare Workers in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pesquisa emprica teve como objetivo investigar as possveis similitudes informacionais entre o ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos e o presidente do Brasil, em virtude do alinhamento poltico-ideolgico entre, respectivamente, Donald Trump e Jair Bolsonaro, que tiveram um posicionamento contraditrio no combate  Covid-19.

Stressors include altered working conditions such as working from home or changes in working hours as well as the difficulty to reconcile work and childcare due to the closure of childcare facilities. The present study examined the relationship of psychosocial work stress (i.e., work-privacy conflict and effort-reward imbalance at work) and depressive symptoms in working parents and whether this association was moderated by individual resilience. Methods: : Data of the present study ( n = 452) were collected in Germany between May and June 2020 as part of the DREAM CORONA study. A subsample of working mothers ( n = 191) and fathers ( n = 261) completed the subscale for work-privacy conflict (WPC) of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multiple linear regression analyses including moderation were performed, controlling for gender, working hours per week, and a lifetime history of depression as potential confounders. Results: : Both WPC ( = 0.336, p < .001) and ERI ( = 0.254, p < .001) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Resilience moderated the relationship between ERI and depressive symptoms ( = -0.101, p = .018), indicating that higher resilience weakened the relationship. However, this effect was not found regarding the relationship between WPC and depressive symptoms ( = 0.055, p = .167). Conclusions: : The results highlight the need for measures to reduce psychosocial work stressors such as WPC and ERI during the COVID-19 pandemic on the one hand and to promote resilience on the other hand. The findings partially support the potential protective role of resilience buffering the association of psychosocial stress and mental health in working parents. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this effect.","output":"Mental health of working parents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Can resilience buffer the impact of psychosocial work stress on depressive symptoms?

OBJECTIVE: To explore the macro-level, meso-level and micro-level barriers and facilitators to the provision of good quality EIA care. METHODS: A qualitative study within 16 purposively sampled rheumatology units across England and Wales. Quality was assessed in relation to 11 quality indicators based on clinical opinion, evidence and variability observed in the data. Data from semi-structured interviews with staff (1-5 from each unit, 56 in total) and an online questionnaire (n=14/16 units) were integrated and analysed using the framework method for thematic analysis using a combined inductive and deductive approach (underpinned by an evidence-based framework of healthcare team effectiveness), and constant comparison of data within and between units and its relationship with the quality criteria. FINDINGS: Quality of care was influenced by an interplay between macro, meso and micro domains. The macro (eg, shared care arrangements and relationships with general practitioners) and meso (eg, managerial support and physical infrastructure) factors were found to act as crucial enablers of and barriers to higher quality service provision at the micro (team) level. These organisational factors directly influenced team structure and function, and thereby EIA care quality. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in quality of EIA care is associated with an interplay between macro, meso and micro service features. Tackling macro and meso barriers is likely to have a significant impact on quality of EIA service, and ultimately patient experience and outcomes.","output":"Exploring the macro-level, meso-level and micro-level barriers and facilitators to the provision of good quality early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) care in England and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This study examines the journey of U.S. dental schools' predoctoral senior class of 2020, from the influences on and their motivations to pursue careers in dentistry, aspects of their dental school experiences, to plans upon graduation and the investment in their careers. METHODS: The study is an analysis of the results of the ADEA Survey of Dental School Seniors, 2020 Graduating Class. Each year, ADEA surveys senior predoctoral students from the accredited U.S. dental schools. Whenever feasible, the answers of the survey respondents from the 2020 class were compared with their 2015 counterparts. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that 46% of the 2020 respondents decided to become a dentist before going to undergraduate college, more than the proportion of those deciding while in college (42%). When it comes to preparedness to practice dentistry, the responses indicated a high level of readiness to go into the profession. Seventy-seven percent of survey participants reported the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect their plans after graduation. Between 2015 and 2020, the share of survey respondents who planned to go into advanced dental education immediately after graduation increased from 35% to 40%. Almost a third of the 2020 respondents who planned to go into private practice immediately upon graduation intended to join a Dental Service Organization (DSO). Grants and scholarships represented a higher share of the average funding for dental education for the 2020 respondents than five years ago. The share of respondents expecting to graduate without any loans to finance their dental degrees and predental education (educational debt) increased significantly, from 12% in 2015 to 17% in 2020.

He showed signs of debilitating dystonia that had been present since puberty. Dystonic symptoms, especially a protrusion of the tongue and bilateral hand tremor, had not responded to botulinum toxin therapy. We diagnosed Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS). METHODS AND MATERIAL Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral globus pallidus internus was performed predominantly with stereotaxic computed tomography angiography guidance under general anesthesia. Electrophysiology was used to identify the target regions and to guide DBS electrode placement. RESULTS In the immediate postoperative course and stimulation, the patient showed marked improvement of facial, extremity, and cervical dystonia. More than 2 years after implantation, his dystonic symptoms had dramatically improved by 82%. DISCUSSION MTS is a rare genetic disorder leading to sensorineural deafness, dystonia, and other symptoms. The use of DBS for the dystonia in MTS was previously described but not in the presence of bilateral CIs. CONCLUSION DBS in MTS may be a viable option to treat debilitating dystonic symptoms.

In 2020 GOSH had installed an EMR. We had unsuccessfully raised concerns about the associated air travel for system assessment, training, and support at that time. COVID exposed the profligacy of business travel and the ease and efficacy of online events. So, we decided to investigate the difference in the carbon emissions before and after this COVID-induced behaviour change.MethodsWe identified all EMR-related training, assessment and support from 2017 to 2021. Using UK Government published conversion factors we calculated emissions for all flights that occurred pre-COVID or would have occurred without COVID.ResultsWe identified 618 pre-COVID flights generating a total of 939tCO2e. 83 (143tCO2e) were for tender/system assessment worldwide, 291 (304tCO2e) were trips for training of GOSH staff in the US and 244 (492tCO2e) were for Go-Live support.During the Pandemic, staff trained at a total of 119 virtual courses generating a total of 0.2tCO2e (assuming Zoom on a PC with a monitor), which with pre-COVID process would have wasted 221tCO2e of the earths exhausted carbon budget.For context, the GOSH total flight emissions equate to 939 knee replacements on the NHS, or the lifetime healthcare emissions of 226 Indians.DiscussionImplementation of a whole hospital EMR has many potential benefits including CO2e emission reductions.

The possibility of having automatic tools helping doctors in performing these important decisions is highly welcome.

The problem with such methods is that they represent black boxes, so they do not provide users with an explanation of the reasons for their decisions. Confidence from medical experts in clinical decisions can increase if they receive from Artificial Intelligence tools interpretable output under the form of, e.g., explanations in natural language or visualized information. This way, the system outcome can be critically assessed by them, and they can evaluate the trustworthiness of the results. In this paper, we propose a new general-purpose method that relies on interpretability ideas. The approach is based on two successive steps, the former being a filtering scheme typically used in Content-Based Image Retrieval, whereas the latter is an evolutionary algorithm able to classify and, at the same time, automatically extract explicit knowledge under the form of a set of IF-THEN rules.

The results of this are increases in morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease in elderly individuals, as well as a weakened vaccination response. The aging of the immune system is thought to affect and be affected by the human virome, the collection of all viruses present in an individual. Persistent viral infections, such as those caused by certain herpesviruses, can be present in an individual for long periods of time without any overt pathology, yet are associated with disease in states of compromised immune function. To better understand the effects on human health of such persistent viral infections, we must first understand how the human virome changes with age. We have now analyzed the composition of the whole blood virome of 317 individuals, 21C70 years old, using a metatranscriptomic approach. Use of RNA sequencing data allows for the unbiased detection of RNA viruses and active DNA viruses. RESULTS: The data obtained showed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the most frequently expressed virus, with other detected viruses being herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, torque teno viruses, and papillomaviruses. Of the 317 studied blood samples, 68 (21%) had EBV expression, whereas the other detected viruses were only detected in at most 6 samples (2%). We therefore focused on EBV in our further analyses. Frequency of EBV detection, relative EBV RNA abundance and the genetic diversity of EBV was not significantly different between age groups (21C59 and 60C70 years old). No significant correlation was seen between EBV RNA abundance and age. Deconvolution analysis revealed a significant difference in proportions of activated dendritic cells, macrophages M1, and activated mast cells between EBV expression positive and negative individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As it is likely that the EBV RNA quantified in this work is derived from reactivation of the latent EBV virus, these data suggest that age does not affect the rate of reactivation nor the genetic landscape of EBV. These findings offer new insight on the genetic diversity of a persistent EBV infection in the long-term.

CASE PRESENTATION: This case study documents a therapeutic intervention for comfort eating with a client, Sarah, in a National Health Service adult Community Learning Disabilities Service. Sarah is a white, British woman in her late thirties, with a diagnosis of Down syndrome who experienced significant problems with comfort eating and subsequent weight management. Despite dieting and exercising, Sarah was clinically obese and experienced weight related pain and psychological distress. Systemic intervention between Sarah, her mother, and the therapist formulated Sarahs eating difficulties using a cognitive behavioural framework. This hypothesised how comfort-eating met her emotional needs and maintained her health difficulties. Remote cognitive behavioural therapy interventions included collaborative behavioural experiments, coping strategies, and homework tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The Maslow Assessment of Needs Scale-Learning Disabilities, Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability, Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability, qualitative feedback from family, as well as frequency data showed significant improvement. Additionally, the case considers the evidence base, assessment, formulation and intervention, before reflecting on its various strengths and limitations. It reflects on the intersectionality of sexuality and intellectual disabilities, and the desire for romantic attachment, which was additionally complicated by the context of coronavirus and social isolation. The environmental influences on comfort eating regarding this case, and in general, the experiences of people with intellectual disabilities are also considered. The potential clinical impact of this case study includes exemplifying an effective comfort eating therapeutic intervention in an often overlooked client group.","output":"Adapted remote cognitive behavioural therapy for comfort eating with a woman with intellectual disabilities: Case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Manatees are the most endangered aquatic mammals in Brazil. The current conservation scenario, together with their biological characteristics, raises concern with the future of this species. Pyothorax, also known as septic pleural effusion or pleural empyema, is characterized by the accumulation of a septic purulent exudate within the pleural space. Although this infection often has a multifactorial etiology, it is most commonly associated with respiratory tract disorders and trauma. Here, we report a case of pyothorax in a Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus) held in captivity for acclimatization in Brazil. Case: A young, male Antillean manatee, aged 4 years and 11 months, measuring 227 cm in total length, and weighing 258 kg was held in captivity for acclimatization (natural environment) in Porto de Pedras in the State of Alagoas, Brazil. The animal died in February 2013 and was sent for necropsy at the CMA/ICMBio laboratory. The study was developed with authorisation from the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (License number 020/2009) and under the license SISBIO/ ICMBio number 20685-1. Externally, the carcass of the animal showed swelling and bulging of the right antimere and purulent secretion from the right nostril.

This could trigger endothelial dysfunction, pyroptosis, and thrombosis, which are the vascular changes, commonly referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) endotheliopathy. Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung samples of patients with COVID-19 and to compare them to pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 subtype 2009 and control cases. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Postmortem lung samples (COVID-19 group =6 cases; H1N1 group =10 cases, and control group =11 cases) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-IL (interleukin)-6, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-, anti-ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and anticaspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and suggested the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in the pulmonary samples.

METHODS Children aged from 2 to 18 years and receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy were eligible for this prospective multicentre study. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the PedsQL? 4.0 questionnaire. Correlations between quality of life scores and time in therapeutic range were measured. RESULTS A total of 121 children were included in the study (mean age 9.64.9 years). Cardiac conditions were the predominant indication for vitamin K antagonists. The mean time in therapeutic range was 0.780.15 overall, and 0.760.24 over the 3-month period before quality of life assessment. The mean total quality of life score was 76.218 in self reports, 71.422 in mother reports and 73.519 in father reports.

While traditionally understood as a myeloid-driven lipid-storage disease, growing evidence suggests that the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ignites an autoimmune response with CD4(+) T-helper (T(H)) cells that recognize self-peptides from Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), the core protein of LDL-C. These autoreactive CD4(+) T cells home to the atherosclerotic plaque, clonally expand, instruct other cells in the plaque, and induce clinical plaque instability.

Their phenotypes and functions deviate from classical immunological concepts of distinct and terminally differentiated T(H) immunity. Instead, ApoB-specific CD4(+) T cells have a highly plastic phenotype, can acquire several, partially opposing and mixed transcriptional programs simultaneously, and transit from one T(H) subset into another over time. In this review, we highlight adaptive immune mechanisms in atherosclerosis with a focus on CD4(+) T cells, introduce novel technologies to detect ApoB-specific CD4(+) T cells at the single cell level, and discuss the potential impact of ApoB-driven autoimmunity in atherosclerosis.","output":"ApoB-Specific CD4(+) T Cells in Mouse and Human Atherosclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: AquaSafe is a mobile learning application that can be used as one of the modalities for teaching, training and risk assessment in aquaculture occupational health and safety (AOHS).

This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. RESULTS Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. CONCLUSION The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government.

Whether MIS-C can also follow SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not clear, making MIS-C an adverse event of special interest following immunization. Monitoring for post-vaccine MIS-C is complicated by the clinical overlap of MIS-C with numerous other inflammatory conditions including Kawasaki Disease, toxic shock syndrome, and viral myocarditis. A case definition for MIS-C was recently created with the Brighton Collaboration (BC). We aimed to determine the performance of the BC MIS-C case definition among a large, single-center MIS-C cohort. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed for the first 100 MIS-C cases at our institution (May 2020-February 2021). All cases met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. Data on age, presentation, laboratory results and cardiac studies were collected and used to determine cases that fulfilled the BC case definition for MIS-C (see figure). Case Definition: Definite Case [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of 100 children (age < 21 years) diagnosed with MIS-C using the CDC case definition, 93 patients also fulfilled the BC definition. All 100 patients had elevated laboratory markers of inflammation and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, 1 patient was excluded for significant respiratory symptoms (pulmonary hemorrhage), 5 were excluded due to only 1 clinical feature, and an additional patient was excluded for having none of the measures of disease activity. Among the 93 patients fulfilling the revised case definition, 88 (95%) met criteria for a definite case. Five of the 93 patients (5%) were considered probable cases, 1 reported only 1 day of fever and 4 had only 1 measure of disease activity. CONCLUSION: The original case definitions for MIS-C were created rapidly following the first emerging reports of this hyperinflammatory state. Knowledge of the varied clinical presentations of this disorder has grown substantially. Modification of the case definition to include features truly representative of MIS-C will allow for more precise diagnosis in the face of conditions which mimic MIS-C, and for accurate and reliable monitoring for adverse events following immunization.

There is concern surrounding potential release of patient-derived bioaerosol during nebuliser drug refill, which could impact the health of caregivers. Consequently, mesh nebulisers have been recommended by various clinical practice guidelines. Currently, there is a lack of empirical data describing the potential for release of patient-derived bioaerosol during drug refill. This study examined the release of simulated patient-derived bioaerosol, and the effect on positive end expiratory pressure during nebuliser refill during mechanical ventilation of a simulated patient. During jet nebuliser refill, the positive end expiratory pressure decreased from 4.5 to 0 cm H(2)O. No loss in pressure was noted during vibrating mesh nebuliser refill. A median particle number concentration of 710 particles cm(?3) above ambient was detected when refilling the jet nebuliser in comparison to no increase above ambient detected when using the vibrating mesh nebuliser. The jet nebuliser with the endotracheal tube clamped resulted in 60 particles cm(?3) above ambient levels.

High prevalence of unnecessary use of antimicrobials in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) has driven demand for the development and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes. The Stepped-wedge Trial to increase antibiotic Appropriateness in Residential aged care facilities and model Transmission of antimicrobial resistance (START) will implement and evaluate the impact of a nurse-led AMS programme on antimicrobial use in 12 RACFs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The START trial will implement and evaluate a nurse-led AMS programme via a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial design in 12 RACFs over 16 months. The AMS programme will incorporate education, aged care-specific treatment guidelines, documentation forms, and audit and feedback strategies that will target aged care staff, general practitioners, pharmacists, and residents and their families. The intervention will primarily focus on urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. RACFs will transition from control to intervention phases in random order, two at a time, every 2 months, with a 2-month transition, wash-in period. The primary outcome is the cumulative proportion of residents within each facility prescribed an antibiotic during each month and total days of antibiotic use per 1000 occupied bed days.

Furthermore, it is not understood why adaptive immune reactions continue to exhibit circadian changes over long periods of time. Using a combination of experimental and mathematical modelling approaches, we show here that dendritic cells (DCs) migrate from the skin to the draining lymph node (LN) in a time-of-day-dependent manner, which provides an enhanced likelihood for functional interactions with T cells. Greater numbers of infiltrating DCs induce rhythmic expression of TNF- in the draining LN, which enhances ICAM-1 expression in high endothelial venules (HEVs), resulting in lymphocyte infiltration and LN expansion. Icam1 is controlled by binding of the core circadian clock transcription factor BMAL1 to its promoter region, and rhythmic Icam1 expression is lost in mice lacking endothelial cell BMAL1.

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Well Women Clinics in regional Hong Kong hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Women attending the Well Women Clinics of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals for breast cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All screening-detected breast cancers. RESULTS After 46 637 screening mammograms and excluding palpable masses detected by the patients themselves, 232 women were detected with cancers, yielding a crude detection rate of 5.0 per 1000. Age range for cancer detection was 35 to 72 (median, 49) years. Clinic staff detected palpable lumps in 83 patients, constituting 36% of the detected cancers, of which 15 (6.5% of all detected cancers) were not identified by mammography. The cancer detection rate was 5.9 per 1000 in the age-group 40-49 years and 3.7 per 1000 in those 50 years or older. The cancer detection rate was 58.5 per 1000 in the high-risk group (aged <40 years with positive family history). The minimal cancer detection rate was 2.2 per 1000, representing 45% of all cancers whose pathology was available to us. Ductal carcinoma in situ comprised 28% of all such cancers. Our recall rates were 4.6% for additional views only, 3.3% for ultrasound only, and 2.3% for both. Positive predictive values for abnormal mammograms and biopsies were 4.9% and 26.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Mammographic screening has been reported to reduce mortality up to 35% in western countries. However, data concerning Asian Chinese populations are meagre. Our Well Women Clinics pioneered large-scale self-referred breast screening in Hong Kong. Despite the lower incidence of breast cancers than in Occidental populations, our screening programme performed comparably to those in the West, and has improved over time. Our screening service for self-referred women detected breast cancers even at an early stage, which facilitated a better prognosis and more treatment options, whilst appearing to be highly acceptable to our community. Besides, it could provide training and expertise in breast radiology and mammography, which are essential prerequisites for establishing population screening.","output":"Opportunistic breast cancer screening in Hong Kong; a revisit of the Kwong Wah Hospital experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives combining restrictive and enabling components may be an effective strategy to achieve short- and long-term objectives.

Objective Analyze the immediate and long-term impact on aztreonam prescribing of combining restrictive and enabling interventions. Setting Single 233-bed community hospital with 45 adult intensive care unit beds in Nashville, Tennessee. Method Retrospective, interrupted time series analysis comparing all patients receiving aztreonam prior to intervention between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011 and following intervention between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2019. Quarterly defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days and microbiology laboratory annual surveillance data were utilized for analysis. Main outcome measure Post-intervention change in trend of aztreonam consumption. Results Following intervention, a significant decline in aztreonam consumption was observed (? 1.97 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days; p = 0.003) resulting in a sustained decrease in aztreonam consumption from 2011 (3rd quarter) to 2019 (3rd quarter) from 15.2 to 0.26 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days.

In order to enhance the contrast, the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm was used to preprocess the X-ray image before network training, then the images were put into the training network and the parameters of the network were adjusted to the optimal. Meanwhile, Leaky ReLU was selected as the activation function. VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, DenseNet121 and SDenseNet models were used to compare with the model proposed in this paper. Compared with ResNet34, the proposed classification model of pneumonia had improved 2.0%, 2.3% and 1.5% in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. Compared with the SDenseNet network without depthwise separable convolution, number of parameters of the proposed model was reduced by 43.9%, but the classification effect did not decrease.

METHODS: Eighty\\\\nine intensive care unit (ICU) patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 were prospectively enrolled and tracked. Point\\\\of\\\\care ultrasound (POCUS) examinations were performed with phased array, convex, and linear transducers using portable machines. The thorax was scanned in 12 lung areas: anterior, lateral, and posterior (superior/inferior) bilaterally. Lower limbs were scanned for deep venous thrombosis and chest computed tomographic angiography was performed to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Follow\\\\up POCUS was performed weekly and before hospital discharge. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (84.2%), with a median age of 43 years. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17 (interquartile range, 10C22) days; the ICU length of stay was 22 (interquartile range, 20.2C25.2) days; and the 28\\\\day mortality rate was 28.1%. On ICU admission, POCUS detected bilateral irregular pleural lines (78.6%) with accompanying confluent and separate B\\\\lines (100%), variable consolidations (61.7%), and pleural and cardiac effusions (22.4% and 13.4%, respectively).

It is a decision-making exploration: the design outcome may vary greatly depending on the designers knowledge and philosophy. Integrated design is one type of design philosophy that takes an interdisciplinary and holistic approach. In civil engineering, structural design is such an activity for creating buildings and infrastructures. Recently, structural design in many countries has emphasized a performance-based philosophy that simultaneously considers a structures safety, durability, serviceability, and sustainability. Consequently, integrated design in civil engineering has become more popular, useful, and important. Material-oriented integrated design and construction of structures (MIDCS) combine materials engineering and structural engineering in the design stage: it fully utilizes the strengths of materials by selecting the most suitable structural forms and construction methodologies. This paper will explore real-world examples of MIDCS, including the realization of MIDCS in timber seismic-resistant structures, masonry arch structures, long-span steel bridges, prefabricated/on-site extruded light-weight steel structures, fiber-reinforced cementitious composites structures, and fiber-reinforced polymer bridge decks. Additionally, advanced material design methods such as bioinspired design and structure construction technology of additive manufacturing are briefly reviewed and discussed to demonstrate how MIDCS can combine materials and structures. A unified strength-durability design theory is also introduced, which is a human-centric, interdisciplinary, and holistic approach to the description and development of any civil infrastructure and includes all processes directly involved in the life cycle of the infrastructure.

Finally, I discuss further questions (e.g., whether using MDMA for enhancing connection can backfire) and promising research areas for building a new science of psychedelic social psychology.

Mouse B-1a cells are a phenotypically and functionally unique sub-population of B cells, providing immediate protection against infection by releasing natural antibodies and immunomodulatory molecules. We hypothesize that B-1a cells ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI. METHODS: Sepsis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). PBS or B-1a cells were adoptively transferred into the septic mice intraperitoneally. After 20 h of CLP, lungs were harvested and assessed by PCR and ELISA for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1) and chemokine (MIP-2) expression, by histology for injury, by TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis, and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay for neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: We found that septic mice adoptively transferred with B-1a cells significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, IL-1 and MIP-2 in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice. Mice treated with B-1a cells showed dramatic improvement in lung injury compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. We found apoptosis in the lungs was significantly inhibited in B-1a cell injected mice compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. B-1a cell treatment significantly down-regulated MPO levels in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice in sepsis.

METHODS: A triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical feeding trial was conducted among children with uncomplicated SAM in Malawi with 3 types of RUTF: DHA-HO-RUTF, HO-RUTF, and S-RUTF. The primary outcomes, measured in a subset of subjects, were the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) global z-score and a modified Willatts problem-solving assessment (PSA) intention score for 3 standardized problems, measured 6 mo and immediately after completing RUTF therapy, respectively. MDAT domain z-scores, plasma fatty acid content, anthropometry, and eye tracking were secondary outcomes. Comparisons were made between the novel PUFA RUTFs and S-RUTF. RESULTS: Among the 2565 SAM children enrolled, mean global MDAT z-scores were C0.69  1.19 and C0.88  1.27 for children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF and S-RUTF, respectively (difference 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.38).

Five teachers were interviewed to better understand their thoughts towards music utilization into their language classrooms. Questions were mainly designed to elicit attitudes of participants related to the research questions. The results of the study indicate that English teachers have positive attitudes toward the use of music in language teaching and view songs as a significant didactic tool that should be employed in EFL classes. Regarding the utilization of music and songs in the context of Covid 19 pandemic, teachers did not face any difficulties during online learning, on the contrary the music activities kept the enthusiasm alive and made learning interesting and fun. However, during face-to-face learning, the pandemic has affected the employment of songs in the English language classes as the students have to use hand sanitizers all the time and wear masks while singing songs. Teachers have also restricted the movement and group work which might have sought the touching of hands with one another and so on. ? 2021, Fikri Soysal.

Objective measures to guide and assess efficacy of interventions in terms of enhanced thriving (as opposed to just decreased pathology) have been limited. Here we provide early data on modifiable targets, potential interventions, and comparative impact. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey-based study of mixed-level residents at 16 academic General Surgery training programs, gender-identity, race, post-graduate year, and gap years were self-reported. Correlation between our primary outcome variable, flourishing, and measures of resilience (mindfulness, personal accomplishment [PA], workplace support, workplace control) and risk (depression, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, perceived stress, anxiety, workplace demand) were assessed. RESULTS: Of 891 recipients, 300 responded (60% non-male, 41% non-white). Flourishing was significantly positively correlated with all measured resilience factors and negatively correlated with all measured risk factors. In multivariable modelling, mindfulness, PA, and workplace support were positively and significantly associated with flourishing, with PA having the strongest resilience effect. Depression and anxiety were negatively and significantly associated with flourishing, with depression having the strongest risk effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that interventions that increase mindfulness, workplace support, and PA, as well as those that decrease depression and anxiety may particularly impact flourishing (i.e., global wellbeing) in surgical trainees. These findings provide preliminary guidance on allocation of resources toward wellbeing interventions. In particular, cognitive (i.e., mindfulness) training is a feasible intervention with modest but significant association with flourishing, and potential indirect effects through influence on PA, anxiety and depression.

New geochronologic studies have further constrained the ages of the fossil-bearing beds, and recent investigations on Early Cretaceous tectonic settings have provided much new information for understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of the biota and dispersal pattern of its members. Notably, the occurrence of the Jehol Biota coincides with the initial and peak stages of the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous, and thus the biotic evolution is related to the North China craton destruction. However, it remains largely unknown how the tectonic activities impacted the development of the Jehol Biota in northeast China and other contemporaneous biotas in neighboring areas in East and Central Asia. It is proposed that the Early Cretaceous rift basins migrated eastward in the northern margin of the North China craton and the Great Xing'an Range, and the migration is regarded to have resulted from eastward retreat of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate. The diachronous development of the rift basins led to the lateral variations of stratigraphic sequences and depositional environments, which in turn influenced the spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota. This study represents an effort to explore the linkage between terrestrial biota evolution and regional tectonics and how plate tectonics constrained the evolution of a terrestrial biota through various surface geological processes.","output":"Spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota: Responses to the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A previously healthy 42-year-old male developed a fever and cough shortly after returning to Canada from overseas.

Both optical and radar imagery has its own deficiencies due to cloud cover in optical imagery and difficulties in interpretation in radar imagery. Therefore, combining optical and radar imagery and classifying the land cover through machine learning (ML) algorithm is necessary. In this study, we compare two methods of ML which are Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost. Sentinel 1 and 2 imageries utilized as the input to derive land cover change from 2016 to 2020. The data is classified into five classes: dense vegetation, sparse vegetation, bare land, water body, and urban, using supervised classification. As for training and validation, the field survey data was conducted.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where people may have limited access to affordable quality care, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to have a particularly adverse impact on the health and healthcare of individuals with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). A World Health Organization survey found that disruption of delivery of healthcare for NCDs was more significant in LMICs than in high-income countries. However, the study did not elicit insights into the day-to-day impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare by front-line healthcare workers (FLHCWs). AIM: To gain insights directly from FLHCWs working in countries with a high NCD burden, and thereby identify opportunities to improve the provision of healthcare during the current pandemic and in future healthcare emergencies. METHODS: We recruited selected frontline healthcare workers (general practitioners, pharmacists, and other medical specialists) from nine countries to complete an online survey (n = 1347). Survey questions focused on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and NCDs; barriers to clinical care during the pandemic; and innovative responses to the many challenges presented by the pandemic. FINDINGS: The majority of FLHCWs responding to our survey reported that their care of patients had been impacted both adversely and positively by the public health measures imposed. Most FLHCs (95%) reported a deterioration in the mental health of their patients.

PATIENTS: Thirty-four critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were compared with 33 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microcirculatory parameters quantified included total vessel density (mm  mm(C2)), functional capillary density (mm  mm(C2)), proportion of perfused vessels (%), capillary hematocrit (%), the ratio of capillary hematocrit to systemic hematocrit, and capillary RBC velocity (m  s(C1)). The number of leukocytes in capillary-postcapillary venule units per 4-second image sequence (4 s(C1)) and capillary RBC microaggregates (4 s(C1)) was measured. In comparison with healthy volunteers, the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed increases in total vessel density (22.8  sd 5.1 vs 19.9  3.3; p < 0.0001) and functional capillary density (22.2  4.8 vs 18.8  3.1; p < 0.002), proportion of perfused vessel (97.6  2.1 vs 94.6  6.5; p < 0.01), RBC velocity (362  48 vs 306  53; p < 0.0001), capillary hematocrit (5.3  1.3 vs 4.7  0.8; p < 0.01), and capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio (0.18  0.0 vs 0.11  0.0; p < 0.0001).

In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay $\\\\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, $R \\\\sim \\\\exp{(-\\\\omega \\\\Delta)}$, where $\\\\omega$ depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27~years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.","output":"Quickest Detection of Critical COVID-19 Phases: When Should Restrictive Measures Be Taken?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the type species of the Aphthovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family.

Importantly, treatment of FMDV-infected cell with autophagy inducer rapamycin, increased viral yield, and inhibition of autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine or small-interfering RNAs, decreased viral replication.

However, despite the adverse circumstances of their territories, leaders have mobilized to face the challenges. Between April and June 2020, the authors of this article interviewed informants in eight Brazilian state capitals, addressing the five points of discussion (intersectoriality, sustainability, empowerment and public participation, equity and the life cycle perspective) recently presented by EUPHA-HP, IUHPE and UNESCO Chair Global Health & Education. Official actions and documents from the Ministry of Health and Municipal Health Departments (SMS) of each capital were also analyzed. No records were found of official actions aimed at COVID-19 that addressed the territories specificities. In total, 15 promotional actions by the communities were identified. The selection of local actors to take on specific responsibilities during the pandemic is highlighted as a relevant action.

More bacterial infections were found in H1N1 negative group (68.8% vs. 89.2%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study patients infected with Influenza A H1N1 differed from H1N1 negative ILI patients in several clinical and laboratory characteristics. The same was observed also by other investigators. The results of the study suggest some other specific features, such as a higher incidence of headache and higher values of troponin in Influenza A H1N1 infected patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics of adult patients with influenza-like illness hospitalized in general ward during Influenza A H1N1 pandemic 2009/2010"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Africa's Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), in partnership with the Department of Defence (DOD) and Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI), is deploying seven hydrogen fuel cell systems at 1 Military Hospital in the capital Pretoria, to assist with the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"South Africa deploys hydrogen fuel cells at Pretoria hospital to support Covid-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A broad-based SARS-CoV-2 testing program for all symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) was implemented in Tenon hospital, Paris, France.

Elective surgical interventions were cancelled or postponed avoiding disease transmission and excessive consumption of critical hospital resources. The main objective for composing this survey was to document the preventive attitude and its variations against Covid19 pandemic in a specific group: Shoulder and elbow surgeons; to evaluate their perception of emergency and to envisage the new normal with the altered order of priority in the upcoming post-coronavirus era. METHODS: An anonymous survey composed of 25 questions was sent to all the members of the Turkish Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (TSSES) in April 22-29, while governmental preventive measures were maximale. A secure, web-based application (SurveyMonkey Inc, SanMateo, CA, USA) was used for the composition of the survey and the analysis of the responses. RESULTS: Eighty-eight responses collected from 129 members of TSSES (68%), with a mean 13.9 years of practice in shoulder and elbow surgery. More than 75% decrease in surgical and outpatient clinical activity was documented. Half of respondents used telemedicine and the rate of obtaining informed consent remained low. The preventive attitude showed significant variation. DISCUSSION: the perception of emergency and the protective measures showed a wide discrepancy among our respondents.

APPROACH We conducted qualitative analysis of responses to three open-ended questions about WHP program participation, collected as part of an existing WHP program evaluation. SETTING A large mid-western university. PARTICIPANTS Of the 20,000 employees emailed an online survey, 3,212 responded (16.1%). The sample was mostly female (75%), white (79%), and comprised of staff members (84%). The average age was 44 years and 67% had annual incomes <$75,001. METHOD We used NVivo-12 Plus and two coders to apply Grounded Theory on the open-ended questions and identify emergent themes. RESULTS Although most respondents were happy with the program, differences across wage categories emerged around time, financial incentives, commute, workload, and organizational policies/support. Employees at all wage levels were enthusiastic about creating a culture of health but needed different supports to do so. For instance, higher-wage workers needed to overcome self-made time constraints, while lower-wage workers needed supervisor support to overcome coverage constraints that prevented participation. CONCLUSION The unique participation challenges experienced by employees in different wage categories provide justification for WHP programs that can better accommodate the participation barriers of all employees.

Hematological manifestations such as thrombocytopenia and reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers are highly prevalent in COVID-19 and have prognostic significance. Few data, however, are available about the prevalence and significance of anemia in COVID-19. In an observational study, we investigated the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of anemia among 206 patients with COVID-19 at the time of their hospitalization in an Internal Medicine unit. The prevalence of anemia was 61% in COVID-19, compared with 45% in a control group of 71 patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of COVID-19, but nasopharyngeal swab tests negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (p = 0.022). Mortality was higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. In COVID-19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderate/severe anemia (25% versus 13%, p = 0.032). In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron and/or vitamin deficiencies. Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient. Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction.

Recent literature has highlighted the role of D-Dimer also in the diagnostic pathway of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and the importance of harmonized reporting [D-dimer unit (DDU) or fibrinogen equivalent unit (FEU);unit of measure;cut-off] in order to guarantee the correct interpretation of the results. Methods: D-Dimer data from 100 EQA participants and the inter-laboratory variability (CV%) of the last 7 years for the most used analytical systems: Werfen, HemosIL HS;Werfen, HemosIL HS-500;Auto D-D, Sclavo;Innovance, Siemens;VIDAS, bioMrieux and STA Liatest, Stago have been evaluated. Results: Concerning the results expression in DDU or FEU, we observed a prevalence of FEU (55.1%) over DDU (44.9%);the value was confirmed in the last 7 years (average FEU = 55.6%), differently from data obtained in the survey conducted in 2014 at a national level. The units used are: ng/mL (67.8%), g/L (29.0%) and mg/L (3.2%) for D-Dimer DDU;ng/mL (57.9%), g/mL (21.0%), g/L (15.8%) and mg/L (5.3%) for D-Dimer FEU.

Some countries have considered the use of immunity certification as a strategy to relax these measures for people who have recovered from the infection by issuing these individuals a document, commonly called an immunity passport. This document certifies them as having protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has advised against the implementation of immunity certification at present because of uncertainty about whether long-term immunity truly exists for those who have recovered from COVID-19 and concerns over the reliability of the proposed serological test method for determining immunity. Immunity certification can only be considered if scientific thresholds for assuring immunity are met, whether based on antibodies or other criteria. However, even if immunity certification became well supported by science, it has many ethical issues in terms of different restrictions on individual liberties and its implementation process. We examine the main considerations for the ethical acceptability of immunity certification to exempt individuals from restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as needing to meet robust scientific criteria, the ethical acceptability of immunity certification depends on its uses and policy objectives and the measures in place to reduce potential harms, and prevent disproportionate burdens on non-certified individuals and violation of individual liberties and rights.","output":"Immunity certification for COVID-19: ethical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected as the causative agent for an outbreak of viral pneumonia in 2019 in Wuhan, China..","output":"Evaluation of Performance of the BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 Chromatographic Immunoassay Test in Patients with Symptoms of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: COVID-19 can be presented with various gastrointestinal symptoms.

Methods: We used purposive sampling through social media and listservs to recruit emergency physicians, from all geographic regions and practice settings, who cared for older patients during the pandemic. We conducted 30-minute semi-structured interviews and offered incentives for participation. Initial interview questions elicited general experiences with telehealth during the pandemic, while later questions focused on special considerations for older patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and de-identified. We created a codebook a priori, double-coded the interview transcripts, and used framework matrix analyses to identify themes and subthemes. Results: We interviewed from July to November 2020. Participating physicians (n=15;academic 10/15, community 5/15) practiced in all US regions. Practice locations included metro (7/15), suburban (6/15), and rural areas (2/15). Physicians reported using telehealth in the outpatient setting and within the emergency department (ED), especially during personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages. Several themes emerged: (1) telehealth as a public health tool, (2) its suitability for EM patients, (3) special considerations for older patients, and (4) the future of telehealth. Physicians noted that telehealth was a valuable public health tool, providing access to accurate, timely information about COVID-19. This assistance was considered integral given changing guidance on testing, hospital capacity concerns necessitating thoughtful triage, and limited availability of PPE. Physicians noted that telehealth improved access to care for EM patients who lived in rural communities, had mental health concerns or mobility challenges, or received home hospital care. Most expressed that telehealth was suitable for low acuity EM complaints, but those with chest or abdominal pain, as well as critical patients, required in-person care to facilitate rapid diagnosis, testing, and interventions. They considered virtual care convenient, efficient and useful for establishing rapport with older patients and caregivers (including for end-of-life conversations). Emergency physicians indicated that telehealth would be beneficial in the future as a complementary method of care rather than a complete replacement of in-person ED visits if reimbursement policies and multi-state licensure concerns were addressed. Conclusions: Emergency physicians indicated that telehealth should be integrated into health care delivery as a complementary tool to traditional in-person EM care as it was integral to providing public health information, in addition to low acuity complaint diagnosis and treatment.

It considers the extent to which HR professionals were prepared for the crisis and their readiness in supporting the wellbeing of their people. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 senior HR professionals working across the public and private sectors in the UK. Using an in-depth interview structure, the research explored how respondents both reacted to and managed the crisis in their respective organisations. Template analysis was used to analyse the data allowing a certain degree of fluidity in the establishment of ordered relationships between the themes. Findings: This study finds that business continuity plans turned out to be useless during the pandemic because they focussed on data, not people. It highlights the tension between home-working and burn-out as online presenteeism increased due to staff changing their behaviour in response to self-surveillance. The paper emphasises the importance of soft skills and authentic leadership and the tensions in respect of equity. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted with HR professionals in the UK, not internationally. Although the sample did include HR professionals from across the public, private and third sectors, the experience may not be representative of all those working in HR. Originality/value: This research found that those organisations that had engaged in business continuity planning prior to the pandemic focussed on the retrieval and accessibility of data rather than people. This prioritises staff as a resource rather than emphasising people as an organisation's most valuable asset. Furthermore, the study found that staff worked harder and for longer periods of time as a consequence of self-imposed surveillance.

However, these representations do not allow quick identifications of significant changes in the outbreak;a key information for estimating the needs for hospital and ICU beds, for decision-making, and resource allocation. Moreover, an epidemic is characterised by a heterogeneous evolution that depends on many unpredictable factors, coming from the virus itself or from its ecosystem. Simulations are very complex and based on hypotheses that are impossible to certify a priori, since each outbreak is different and has specific characteristics. A validation phase is necessary that may delay the usefulness of these tools. We tested a simpler method for monitoring the epidemic and rapidly predicting the peak. RESULTS: We present here a simple and easy-to-draw figure by plotting the daily rate of change in the number of patients as a function of time. This allows: (1) to rapidly identify the changes in the infection growth, (2) to extrapolate the regression lines for predicting the peaks, and (3) to use simple statistical models for identifying the significant inflexions and deriving the uncertainties.

Samples were tested for HBoV by PCR amplifying a part of the NS1 gene. RESULTS: Human bocavirus was detected in 12 children (3.2%). Four of the 12 cases were co-infections, 3 of them with influenza A and 1 with coronavirus OC43. Cases were observed only during the cold months. The mean age of children was 1.8 years (range 2 months to 4 years). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and various degrees of respiratory distress. All children were clinically diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia and acute laryngotracheobronchitis, and recovered uneventfully.

Despite enormous efforts, it is not clear how SARS-CoV2 adapts and evolves in a clonal background. Laboratory research is hindered by high biosafety demands. How-ever, the rapid sequence availability opened doors for bioinformatics. Using different bioinformatics programs, we investigated 6305 sequences for clonality, expressions strategies, and evolutionary dynamics. Results showed high nucleotide identity of 99.9% among SARS-CoV2 indicating clonal evolution and genome. High sequence identity and phylogenetic tree concordance were obtained with isolates from different regions. In any given tree topology, ~50% of isolates in a country formed country-specific sub-clusters. However, abundances of subtle overexpression strategies were found including transversions, signature-sequences and slippery-structures. Five different short tracks dominated with identical location patterns in all genomes where Slippery-4 AAGAA was the most abundant. Interestingly, transversion and transition substitutions mostly affected the same amino acid residues implying compensatory changes. To ensure these strategies were independent of sequence clonality, we simultaneously examined sequence homology indicators;tandem-repeats, restriction-site, and 3 UTR, 5 UTR-caps and stem-loop locations in addition to stringent alignment parameters for 100% identity which all confirmed stability. Nevertheless, two rare events;a rearrange-ment in two SARS-CoV2 isolates against betacoronavirus ancestor and a polymorphism in S gene, were detected. Thus, we report on abundance of transversions, slippery sequences, and ON/OFF molecular structures, implying adaptive expressions had occurred, despite clonal evolution and genome stability. Furthermore, functional validation of the point mutations would provide insights into mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 virulence and adaptation.","output":"In-silico pangenomics of sars-cov-2 isolates reveal evidence for subtle adaptive expression strategies, continued clonal evolution, and sub-clonal emergences, despite genome stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning platforms take over a new role in education, especially in times of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The information on protective measures when using instrumental techniques in speech research and therapy may be useful for colleagues in research and the clinic. AIMS: The primary aims are: (1) to find out whether there are any published recommendations regarding protective measures for using EPG in research and clinic settings; (2) to discuss the impact of the pandemic and the corresponding restrictions and general protective measures directed (or advised) by local government and professional bodies at each stage of EPG work; and (3) to share experiences in using modified procedures for face\\\\to\\\\face EPG therapy sessions and combined EPG teletherapy. In addition, a brief overview of EPG and a summary of EPG research and clinical activities in Japan presented by one of the symposium organizers at the symposium are included. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A review of the literature regarding protective measures recommended for using EPG for speech assessment and treatment or research, supplemented by a discussion of our own experiences. MAIN CONTRIBUTION: The literature review showed that there are no guidelines regarding protective measures for using EPG, but there is some advice regarding speech recording using microphones. Most published articles related to speech and language therapy (SLT) service during COVID\\\\19 are about telepractice or general clinical guidelines for face\\\\to\\\\face speech therapy sessions. The protective measures for using EPG developed based on the general guidelines recommended by local government and professional bodies (e.g., using visors, transparent acrylic board) were described. Using EPG in telepractice was discussed as well. CONCLUSIONS: It has been challenging to continue EPG research and therapy during the pandemic. In order to deal with this crisis, available knowledge regarding infection control and recommendations from local government and professional bodies were applied to design methods and procedures that allowed EPG research and therapy to continue. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: There are general protective measures recommended by local government and professional bodies regarding speech therapy sessions (e.g., using personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing), but little is known about the measures for using instrumental techniques in speech research and therapy, particularly EPG. The equipment of each instrumental technique is different, so measures that are appropriate for one may not be suitable for others. Hence, specific recommendations are needed for EPG. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: This paper provides pointers to information about recommendations regarding protective measures for speech research and therapy, supplemented with suggestions specific to EPG provided by experienced users based on actual experience. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? In evaluating the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on EPG research and therapy, an analytical approach was taken to break down the steps involved in carrying out those activities, and the challenges we faced and the possible alternatives for completing the tasks were discussed. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate other aspects of speech therapy service.","output":"Electropalatography (EPG) activities in Japan and the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on EPG research and therapy: A report of presentations at the 7th EPG Symposium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate whether sarcoidosis patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for adverse disease outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System during March 1, 2020 to July 29, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. We identified sarcoidosis patients who met diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis according to accepted guidelines. An adverse disease outcome was defined as the presence of intubation and mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality. In sarcoidosis patients, we reported (when available) the results of pulmonary function testing measured within 3 years prior to the time of SARS?CoV?2 infection. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to generate an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to evaluate sarcoidosis as a risk factor for an adverse outcome. The same model was used to analyze sarcoidosis patients with moderate and/or severe impairment in pulmonary function. RESULTS: The study included 7337 patients, 37 of whom (0.5%) had sarcoidosis. The crude rate of developing an adverse outcome was significantly higher in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function (9/14 vs. 3/23, p = 0.003). While the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was not independently associated with risk of an adverse event, (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9C3.6), the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function was associated with an adverse outcome (aOR 7.8, 95% CI 2.4C25.8).

Peer supporters may be at risk for emotional exhaustion and secondary traumatic stress due to their primary roles and involvement as peer supporters during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Peer supporters from five well-established peer support programs completed surveys (ProQOL and a five-item emotional exhaustion measure) to assess secondary traumatic stress, compassion satisfaction, and burnout during the pandemic. Analysis of variance models analyzed differences in these well-being outcomes by role, age, years in health care, and working in high-risk areas. Qualitative content analysis was performed for open-response questions about challenges, needs, and successful well-being strategies using Braun and Clarke's six-phase thematic analysis. RESULTS A total of 375 peer supporters completed the survey between spring and summer 2021 for a response rate of about 38%. Most participants had low secondary traumatic stress and moderate to high compassion satisfaction; nearly 44% had concerning levels of emotional exhaustion. Compassion satisfaction was significantly lower (p = 0.003) and emotional exhaustion significantly higher (p < 0.001) among the youngest cohort, and both compassion satisfaction and emotional exhaustion differed across career stages (p = 0.003 and p = 0.04, respectively). Emotional exhaustion was significantly higher in peer supporters working in COVID units than in non-COVID units (p = 0.021).

METHODS: A survey form was sent to 424 residents in the School of Stomatology, Wuhan University (WHUSS) in September 2020. The form included 23 questions on demographics, study situation of residents during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak, effect of COVID\\\\19 on graduates, and status of residents who returned to clinic training. RESULTS: A total of 361 (85%) survey forms were collected. Over 70% of respondents felt anxious during Wuhan lockdown. Most respondents continued studying (94%) mainly through free online resources (79%). The majority reported improvement in didactic knowledge (80%), but the respondents perceptions of their clinical skills, especially those in Wuhan, did not change (41%) or worsened (40%) (p < 0.05). Most graduates (88%) reported having found jobs or continued study. Among the 209 responders who returned to clinical training, 52% felt no concern about COVID\\\\19 infection, 89% thought they were equipped with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and 57% indicated that they received sufficient knowledge for preventing COVID\\\\19 in clinic. Most respondents agreed that the way to gain the knowledge for preventing COVID\\\\19 in clinic was training at dental school (93%). CONCLUSION: Although online study has been appreciated by residents, concern about clinical skill learning in the COVID\\\\19 hardest\\\\hit area has arisen. Most graduates felt that the impact of COVID\\\\19 on their immediate postgraduation career was limited.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to identify patterns of daily coping and individuals' coping repertoires (i.e., range of coping patterns employed across situations) during a COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We investigated day-level covariates (appraisals, worrying, mood) of daily coping patterns and person-level covariates (psychopathology, average mood) of coping repertoires. Design: A non-representative community sample (n = 322, 15-82 years old) participated in a 21-day ambulatory assessment study. METHODS We applied multilevel latent class analysis.. RESULTS We identified seven daily coping patterns and ten classes of individuals differing in the size of their coping repertoire and their propensity for polyregulation. Daily coping patterns differed in daily perceived controllability and mood (but not in daily worrying or stress). At the person level, individuals with a higher level of average coronavirus-related worrying more frequently engaged in a high degree of polyregulation. The size of individuals' coping repertoire was unrelated to psychopathology and average mood. CONCLUSION The findings provide insights into the composition of daily coping patterns and individuals' coping repertoires during crisis periods and contribute to a new polyregulation perspective on coping.","output":"Coping under a COVID-19 lockdown: patterns of daily coping and individual differences in coping repertoires."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognised as a major contributor to disease, disability and ultimately death, but measuring the levels of chronic inflammation remains non-canonised, making it difficult to relate chronic inflammation and mortality. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), an emerging biomarker of chronic inflammation, has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker associated with future incidence of chronic disease and mortality in general as well as patient populations. Proper prognostic biomarkers are important as they can help improve risk stratification in clinical settings and provide guidance in treatment or lifestyle decisions as well as in the design of randomised trials. Here, we wish to summarise the evidence about the overall association of the biomarker suPAR with mortality in healthy, general and patient populations across diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The search will be conducted using Medline, Embase and Scopus databases from their inception to 03 June 2020 to identify studies investigating 'suPAR' and 'mortality'. Observational studies and control groups from intervention studies written in English or Danish will be included. The 'Quality In Prognosis Studies' tool will be used to assess the risk of bias for the studies included. Unadjusted and adjusted mortality outcome measures (eg, risk ratios, ORs, HRs) with 95% CIs will be extracted for healthy individuals, general and patient populations. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality within any given follow-up. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on time of outcome, cause of death, population type, adjustments for conventional risk factors and inflammation markers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will synthesise evidence on the use of suPAR as a prognostic marker for mortality. The results will be disseminated by publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Data used will be obtained from published studies, and ethics approval is therefore not necessary for this systematic review.

To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune na?ve population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population. Importance Facing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders.

The results show that isolation measures can significantly reduce the epidemic final size and the number of dead, and the greater the intensity of measures, the better, but duration of the epidemic will be prolonged. Whenever isolation measures are taken, the epidemic final size and the number of dead can be reduced. In early stage of the epidemic, taking measures one day later has little impact, but after a certain period, if taking measures one day later, the epidemic final size and the number of dead increase sharply. Taking measures as early as possible makes the maximum number of patients appear later, which is conducive to expanding medical bed resources and reducing the pressure on medical resource demand.

Methods: We compared immune responses in ambulatory adults vaccinated with mRNA-1273 , BNT-162b2 or Ad26.COV2.S in Massachusetts, USA between February and May 2021. Control groups were pre-pandemic controls (n=1220) and individuals without (n=112) or with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=130) sampled in mid-2020. We measured total anti-spike IgG/M/A antibodies (Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2 S assay), anti-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) antibodies; neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus; and T-cell responses. Findings In individuals with prior infection, all vaccines were associated with higher antibody concentrations and neutralization than those in convalescent individuals, even after a single dose. In individuals without prior infection, a single dose of either mRNA vaccine yielded comparable concentrations and neutralization to convalescent unvaccinated individuals, and Ad26.COV2.S yielded lower antibody concentrations and neutralization titers. The second dose of either mRNA vaccine boosted responses. At a median of 24 days after vaccination, two of 21 (9.5%) Ad26.COV2.S recipients had a neutralization titer higher than pre-pandemic controls; repeat sampling at a median 66 days after vaccination found most (11/15 (73%) remained negative. Antibody concentrations and neutralization titers increased similarly after the first dose of either vaccine, and even further in recipients of a second dose of vaccine. T-cell responses were higher in mRNA1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines vary significantly in immunogenicity in individuals without prior infection.

The United States has been the worst affected, with more than 11M confirmed cases and 246K deaths (as of November 2020). Two primary and persisting concerns are the continued necessity for shutdown/isolation and the possibility of singular waves of rapid virus spread that could overwhelm global healthcare systems, resulting in preventable mortality and substantial economic burden. While vaccines are being developed and disseminated, the need for remote patient care has never been more critical. To that end, we developed a Covid-19 remote triage software, Vironix, which uses machine-learning algorithms to enable real-time risk stratification and decision support for users. This remote management approach has significant potential to increase safety, improve health outcomes, and stem virus spread as organizations reopen. METHODS Vironix uses personalized machine-learning algorithms trained off clinical characteristic data from the EU, East Asia, and the USA in tandem with prescribed guidelines from the CDC, WHO, and Zhejiang University's handbook on Covid-19 prevention. Clinical characteristics of thousands of patients in the literature were mapped into patient vignettes using Bayesian inference. Subsequent stacked, ensemble decision tree classifiers were trained on these vignettes to classify severity of presenting symptoms and signs. Crucially, the algorithm continuously learns from ongoing use of the application, strengthening decisions, and adapting decision boundaries based on inputted information. Vironix was deployed using a user-friendly API, allowing users to easily screen themselves and obtain remote decision support through a variety of devices (mobile apps, computers, health monitors, etc).RESULTS Algorithm performance was assessed based on its binary classification performance in an out-of-sample test set including severe and nonsevere labels. Vironix correctly assigned the severity classes with an accuracy of 87.6%. Vironix further demonstrated superior specificity (87.8%) and sensitivity (85.5%) in identifying positive (severe) presentations of Covid-19. The algorithms, deployed behind the Vironix Web Application, have been invoked by tens of thousands of users around the world. CONCLUSION 1. The Vironix approach is a highly novel, generalizable methodology for mapping clinical characteristic data into patient scenarios for the purpose of training machine-learning prediction models to detect health deterioration due to viral illness. 2. Vironix exhibits excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying and triaging clinical presentations of Covid-19 and the most appropriate level of medical urgency. 3. Algorithms continuously learn and improve decision boundaries as individual user input increases. .","output":"Vironix: A machine-learned approach to remote screening, surveillance, and triage of viral respiratory illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the sociodemographic features, impairments, and functional changes of COVID-19-positive individuals who underwent inpatient rehabilitation at three rehabilitation hospitals in Toronto, Canada Design: Retrospective chart review of patients admitted to three COVID-19 rehabilitation units between 20 April 2020 and 3 June 2020 Sociodemographic factors, impairments, length of stay, and Functional Independence Measure data were reported Results: A total of 41 patients were included in this study, including 22 males and 19 females The median age was 75 years Thirty-six percent of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit during their acute stay The most commonly affected body functions were: neuromusculoskeletal (73 2%);combined cardiovascular, haematological, immunological, and respiratory (65 9%);and mental functions (29 3%) Median total Functional Independence Measure score was 85 at admission and 108 5 at discharge Conclusion: This study represents some of the first data on the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19-positive individuals admitted to inpatient rehabilitation in Toronto, Canada early in the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19-Positive Individuals Admitted for Inpatient Rehabilitation in Toronto, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract More and more educational institutions have to replace face-to-face classes with online learning classes or e-learning due to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Each surveillance system may have a unique situation in which evaluating its quality depends on its methodology, aims, and other factors, such as the frequency of repeating the survey in the case of survey-based surveillance. OBJECTIVE: As the consistency of the surveillance system to capture demographic data and its sensitivity to monitor the intended health-related event are important indicators of the quality of the surveillance system, the aim of this article is to evaluate the Saudi Arabia Mental Health Surveillance System (MHSS) in terms of consistency and sensitivity via the scientific hypothesis testing process. METHODS: The quality of the MHSS was assessed by examining (1) the consistency of the main demographic variables and (2) the sensitivity to changes in score between the 2 mental health screening tools used in the MHSS and between the 3 waves collected in 3 consecutive months. The assessment uses all data collected via the MHSS between May 2020 and July 2020. The first null hypothesis predicted there were differences between the distributions of the demographic variables between the 3 waves. The second predicted there were no differences between the scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) between the 3 waves. RESULTS: In terms of sampling variables (age, gender, and region), there were no significant differences between the 3 waves in age, using one-way ANOVA, nor in gender and region, using the chi-square test. In addition, there were no significant differences between the 3 waves in all other demographic variables, except in the income variable. However, in terms of the PHQ-9 score, the one-way ANOVA (F(2,12334)=8.05; P<.001) showed significant differences between waves. Similarly, significant differences between waves were found in the GAD-7 score (F(2,12334)=7.09; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The MHSS showed a consistent distribution of the sample demographic variables, while being sensitive to the changes in mental health scores across waves. The MHSS can generate an acceptable level of consistency and sensitivity to monitor mental health trends.

Covid-19 and hospitalizations for Covid-19 may carry several potential risk factors for thrombosis. Severe coagulation abnormalities may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a strong pathophysiological rationale, the evidences in literature are not enough to recommend an aggressive antithrombotic therapy in COVID- 19. However, it is our opinion that an early use, even at home at the beginning of the disease, could improve the clinical course.","output":"The thromboembolism in COVID-19: the unsolved problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing quantity of public and private data sets focused on small molecules screened against biological targets or whole organisms provides a wealth of drug discovery relevant data. This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches.

Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and the effectiveness of control efforts. Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focussed on high-income settings. METHODS: Here, we conduct a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis of surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to surveys previously carried out in high-income countries. Using individual-level data from 28,503 participants and 413,069 contacts across 27 surveys we explored how contact characteristics (number, location, duration and whether physical) vary across income settings. RESULTS: Contact rates declined with age in high- and upper-middle-income settings, but not in low-income settings, where adults aged 65+ made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and mixed with all age-groups. Across all settings, increasing household size was a key determinant of contact frequency and characteristics, but low-income settings were characterised by the largest, most intergenerational households. A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low-income settings, and work/school contacts were more frequent in high-income strata. We also observed contrasting effects of gender across income-strata on the frequency, duration and type of contacts individuals made. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for both spread of respiratory pathogens, as well as the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region;here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG in seroprevalent patients receiving dialysis. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Nationwide sample from dialysis facilities. PATIENTS: 2215 patients receiving dialysis who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Remainder plasma from routine monthly laboratories was used to measure semiquantitative RBD IgG index value over 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 2063 (93%) seroprevalent patients reached an assay detectable response (IgG index value 1). Most (n = 1323, 60%) had responses in July with index values classified as high (IgG 10); 1003 (76%) remained within this stratum. Adjusted median index values declined slowly but continuously (July vs. December values were 21 vs. 13; P < 0.001). The trajectory of the response did not vary by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, or diabetes status. Patients without an assay detectable response (n = 137) were more likely to be White and in the younger (18 to 44 years) or older (80 years) age groups and less likely to have diabetes and hypoalbuminemia. LIMITATION: Lack of data on symptoms or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnosis, cohort of persons who survived infection, and use of a semiquantitative assay. CONCLUSION: Despite impaired immunity, most seropositive patients receiving dialysis maintained RBD antibody levels over 6 months.

Ebselen shows some efficacy in post-stroke neuroprotection and is currently in trial for the treatment and prevention of hearing loss, Menieres Disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In vitro screening studies show that ebselen is also an effective inhibitor of the enzyme inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which is a key target of the mood-stabilising drug lithium. Further, in animal experimental studies, ebselen produces effects on the serotonin system very similar to those of lithium and also decreases behavioural impulsivity. The antidepressant effects of lithium in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have been attributed to its ability to facilitate presynaptic serotonin activity; this suggests that ebselen might also have a therapeutic role in this condition. Human studies utilising magnetic resonance spectroscopy support the notion that ebselen, at therapeutic doses, inhibits IMPase in the human brain. Moreover, neuropsychological studies support an antidepressant profile for ebselen based on positive effects on emotional processing and reward seeking. Ebselen also lowers a human laboratory measure of impulsivity, a property that has been associated with lithiums anti-suicidal effects in patients with mood disorders.

Coronavirus infections are highly species specific with virus exhibiting a strong tissue and cell specificity. In this report we evaluated the cellular basis of JHM virus retinal tropism. Retinal cultures and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)-retinal mixed cell cultures were prepared from eyes obtained from Balb/c mice. The ability of JHM virus to infect and replicate in these retinal cultures was evaluated by light microscopy, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and virus isolation. Cytopathology was not observed and virus could not be detected in supernatant fluid in retinal cultures. However, low levels of infectious virus could be detected within the cells for the first 4 days. This observation suggested that cell-to-cell interactions may be critical since virus particles and virus antigens can be seen in vivo within the neural retina and the RPE. In contrast to the retinal cultures, retinal-RPE mixed cultures were supportive to JHM virus replication. Syncytial cytopathology was observed for the first 4 days and virus was isolated from supernatant fluids. By electron microscopy, virus was found intracellularly within vacuoles and extracellularly at the plasma membrane. After Day 4, a persistent virus infection was established in which cells produced virus for 5 weeks without cytopathic effects or cell death. Double-labeling immunofluorescent studies of retinal-RPE mixed cultures showed that the virus antigen was co-expressed with a Muller cell marker, glutamine synthetase.

Despite this recent success, there are still several aspects related to the structure, function and dynamics of the CoV-2 polymerase that still need to be addressed. This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three 'druggable' allosteric sites within the NSP12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in \\"smart working\\", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home.

Here, we consider the route of immunization as a critical factor in eliciting tissue resident memory (Trm) populations that are not a target of current licensed intramuscular vaccines. Intranasal vaccination has the potential to boost tissue resident B and T cell populations that reside within specific niches of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Within these niches, Trm cells are poised to respond rapidly to pathogen re-encounter by nature of their anatomic localization and their ability to rapidly deliver anti-pathogen effector functions. Unique features of mucosal immunity in the upper and lower respiratory tracts suggest that antigen localized to these regions is required for the elicitation of protective B and T cell immunity at these sites and will need to be considered as an important attribute of a rationally designed intranasal vaccine.

ECOG PS is a longstanding and ubiquitous feature of oncology. It was evolved 40 years ago as an adaption of the 70-year-old Karnofsky performance score. It is short, easily understood and part of the global language of oncology. The wide prevalence of the ECOG PS attests to its proven utility and worth to help triage patient treatment. The ECOG PS is problematic. It is a unidimensional functional score. It is mostly physician assessed, subjective and therefore open to bias. It fails to account for multimorbidity, frailty or cognition. Too often the PS is recorded only once in wilful ignorance of a patient's changing physical state. As modern oncology offers an ever-widening array of therapies that are personalised to tumour genotype, modern oncologists must strive to better define patient phenotype. Using a wider range of scoring and assessment tools, oncologists can identify deficits that may be reversed or steps taken to mitigate detrimental effects of treatment. These tools can function well to identify those patients who would benefit from comprehensive assessment.

In addition, motivators and barriers regarding sharing of medical records were examined. METHODS: This observational survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic (second half of 2020). The questionnaire link was disseminated through two social media platforms (WhatsApp and Facebook), targeting Jordanian adults (age >18 years). RESULTS: In this study, 1,194 participants agreed to complete the study survey. Results showed that 58.3% of them (n = 696) reported to be willing to share their medical data. while 17.6% of the participants (n = 210) showed hesitancy to share their medical information. The most important motivators as perceived by the study participants were helping other patients who have similar health conditions (n = 995, 83.3%). Moreover, fearing from stigma (n = 753, 63.1%), and the lack of confidence in data security and privacy (n = 728, 61.0%) were among the main barriers preventing participants from sharing their information. Finally, results showed that participants with higher educational level (bachelor or higher) (OR = 0.299, P<0.001), or those living in center of Jordan (OR = 0.270, P<0.001) showed a lower tendency to share their medical data. While participants those who have shared data before showed a higher tendency to share their medical data (OR = 2.524, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, many of the participants had a positive attitude towards sharing biomedical data for scientific research during the COVID-19 pandemic, many had doubts in the control over their data.

A major limitation in the comparability of the data available is attributed to the differences in diagnostic techniques employed and cat populations sampled. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. infantum infection in owned cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and the identification of potential risk factors. Blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum, by an immunofluorescence antibody test and for the parasites DNA, by real-time PCR. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. An overall cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and/or qPCR (0.8%), with a higher rate (10.5%) in southern Italy. The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was significantly associated to the geographical areas (South vs North and Centre; p<0.0001), age class (from 19 months to 6 years old vs 18 months old, p = 0.0003), neutering status (not neutered vs neutered, p = 0.0028) and FIV infection (p = 0.0051).Though the role of cats in the epidemiology of L. infantum is still debated, our findings indicate that cats are exposed to and/or infected by this protozoan, mainly in endemic regions of Italy. Hence, a standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats and for screening cat population is crucial for a better understanding of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis, and of the potential role of cats in the transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.","output":"A nationwide survey of Leishmania infantum infection in cats and associated risk factors in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is serological evidence that bovine group C rotaviruses exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.","output":"Dual infection of gnotobiotic calves with bovine strains of group A and porcine-like group C rotaviruses influences pathogenesis of the group C rotavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three novel substituted zinc (II) phthalocyanines (one anionic, one cationic and one neutral) were compared to two clinically used photosensitizers, 5,10,15,20-tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (m-THPC) and polyhematoporphyrin (PHP), as potential agents for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Using the RIF-1 cell line, photodynamic efficacy was shown to be related to cellular uptake. The cationic phthalocyanine (PPC, pyridinium zinc [II] phthalocyanine) had improved activity over the other two phthalocyanines and slightly improved activity over PHP and m-THPC. The initial subcellular localization of each photosensitizer was dependent upon the hydrophobicity and plasma protein binding. The phthalocyanines had a punctate distribution indicative of lysosomes, whereas m-THPC and PHP had a more diffuse cytoplasmic localization. A relocalization of phthalocyanine fluorescence was observed in some cases following low-level light exposure, and this was charge dependent. The anionic phthalocyanine (TGly, tetraglycine zinc [II] phthalocyanine) relocalized to the nuclear area, the localization of the hydrophobic phthalocyanine (TDOPc, tetradioctylamine zinc [II] phthalocyanine) was unchanged, whereas the distribution of the cationic phthalocyanine (PPC) became more cytoplasmic.

A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others.

The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images. METHODS: Due to the scarcity of the COVID-19 benchmark dataset, we have employed deep transfer learning techniques, where we examined 15 different pre-trained CNN models to find the most suitable one for this task. RESULTS: A total of 860 images (260 COVID-19 cases, 300 healthy and 300 pneumonia cases) have been employed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, where 70% images of each class are accepted for training, 15% is used for validation, and rest is for testing. It is observed that the VGG19 obtains the highest classification accuracy of 89.3% with an average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.90, 0.89, 0.90, respectively.

Patients on dialysis may be exposed to greater risk of infection due to an inability to isolate. Consideration of these competing risks is important before restarting suspended transplant programs. This study compared outcomes in kidney and kidney/pancreas transplant recipients with those on the waiting list, following admission with COVID-19 in a high prevalence region. METHODS Audit data from all 6 London transplant centres were amalgamated. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and outcomes included mortality, intensive care (ITU) admission and ventilation. Adult patients who had undergone a kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant, and those active on the transplant waiting list at the start of the pandemic were included. RESULTS 121 transplant recipients (TR) and 52 waiting list patients (WL) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 36 TR died (30%), whilst 14 WL patients died (27% p=0.71). There was no difference in rates of admission to ITU or ventilation. 24% of TR required renal replacement therapy, and 12% lost their grafts. Lymphocyte nadir and D-dimer peak showed no difference in those who did and did not die. No other co-morbidities or demographic factors were associated with mortality, except for age (odds ratio of 4.3 [95% CI 1.8 - 10.2] for mortality if aged over 60 years) in TR.

RECENT FINDINGS: We noticed that most elective surgeries including living donor transplant operations were suspended in most countries. The response to deceased donor transplants varied between countries: in some deceased donor transplants continued with modified donor and recipient criteria, while in other countries this surgery was suspended. There was a general trend of decreasing or holding antimetabolites, treating the virus with hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin, and converting outpatient clinics to virtual clinics. SUMMARY: We learned how to carefully select donors and recipients, tailor immunosuppressant regiments, and implement telemedicine.

Uro-oncology (UO) patients are particularly vulnerable but in urgent need of life-saving systemic treatments. Our multicentric study examined the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the medical care of UO patients in German university hospitals receiving ongoing systemic anti-cancer treatment and to detect the delay of medical care, defined as deferred medical treatment or deviation of the pre-defined follow-up assessment. METHODS: Data of 162 UO patients with metastatic disease undergoing systemic cancer treatment at five university hospitals in Germany were included in our analyses. The focus of interest was any delay or change in treatment between February 2020 and May 2020 (first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in Germany). Statistical analysis of contingency tables were performed using Pearsons chi-squared and Fishers exact tests, respectively. Effect size was determined using Cramrs V (V). RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 162 patients (14.8%) experienced a delay in systemic treatment of more than 2 weeks. Most of these received immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments (13/24, 54.2%, p = 0.746).

We present a means to optimize a forecasting model by functionalizing our previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model with SEIR-like parameters. Conversely, SEIR models can be adapted to better incorporate real-time data. Methods: Our previously reported asymmetric Gaussian model was shown to greatly improve on forecasting accuracy relative to use of symmetric functions, such as Gaussian and error functions for death rates and cumulative deaths, respectively. However, the reported asymmetric Gaussian implementation, which fitted well to the ascent and much of the recovery side of the real death rate data, was not agile enough to respond to changing social behavior that is resulting in persistence of infections and deaths in the later stage of recovery. We have introduced a time-dependent {sigma}(t) parameter to account for transmission rate variability due to the effects of behavioral changes such as social distancing and subsequent social easing. The {sigma}(t) parameter is analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 (infection factor) that is evidently not a constant during the progression of COVID-19 for a particular population. The popularly used SEIR model and its many variants are also incorporating a time dependent R0(t) to better describe the effects of social distancing and social easing to improve predictive capability when extrapolating from real-time data. Results: Comparisons are given for the previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model and to the revised, what we call, SEIR Gaussian model. We also have developed an analogous model based on R0(t) that we call SEIR Statistical model to show the correspondence that can be attained. It is shown that these two models can replicate each other and therefore provide similar forecasts based on fitting to the same real-time data. We show the results for reported U.S. death rates up to June 12, 2020 at which time the cumulative death count was 113,820. The forecasted cumulative deaths for these two models and compared to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model are 140,440, 139,272, and 149,690 (for 8/4/20) and 147,819, 148, 912, and 201,129 (for 10/1/20), respectively. We also show how the SEIR asymmetric Gaussian model can also account for various scenarios of social distancing, social easing, and even rebound outbreaks where the death and case rates begin climbing again. Conclusions: Forecasting models, based on real-time data, are essential for guiding policy and human behavior to minimize the deadly impact of COVID-19 while balancing the need to socialize and energize the economy. It is becoming clear that changing social behavior from isolation to easing requires models that can adapt to the changing transmission rate in order to more accurately forecast death and case rates. We believe our asymmetric Gaussian approach has advantages over modified SEIR models in offering simpler governing equations that are dependent on fewer variables.","output":"A Statistical and Dynamical Model for Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths based on a Hybrid Asymmetric Gaussian and SEIR Construct"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of the article is to analyse how to use the information technologies for the sanitary education and training in dentistry.

Renal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used to evaluate regional oximetry in a non-invasive continuous real-time fashion, and reflects tissue perfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between renal oximetry and development of AKI in the operative and post-operative setting in infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. METHODS In this prospective study, we enrolled 59 infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart disease for univentricular (n = 26) or biventricular (n = 33) repair. Renal NIRS was continuously measured intraoperatively and for at least 24 hours postoperatively and analysed for the intraoperative and first 12 hours, first 24 hours and first 48 hours postoperatively. The renal oximetry values were correlated with the paediatric risk, injury, failure, loss, end (pRIFLE) classification for AKI, renal biomarkers and the postoperative course. RESULTS Twenty-eight (48%) infants developed AKI based on pRIFLE classification. Already during intraoperative renal oximetry and further in the first 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively, significantly lower renal oximetry values in AKI patients compared with patients with normal renal function were recorded (P < 0.05). Of the 28 patients who developed AKI, 3 (11%) needed renal replacement therapy and 2 (7%) died. In the non-AKI group, no deaths occurred. Infants with decreased renal oximetry values developed significantly higher lactate levels 24 hours after surgery. Cystatin C was a late parameter of AKI, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values were not correlated with AKI occurrence. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that prolonged low renal oximetry values during cardiac surgery correlate with the development of AKI and may be superior to conventional biochemical markers.

The objective of this transdiagnostic analysis was to examine the effect of benzodiazepines on treatment outcomes in older patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS Secondary analyses of data from 2 clinical trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for GAD (escitalopram vs placebo, 2006-2009) or MDD (open treatment with venlafaxine, 2009-2014) were conducted. Participants included 640 adults aged 60+ years with DSM-IV-defined GAD (n = 177) or MDD (n = 463). Benzodiazepine data were collected at baseline. Adherence and treatment response were assessed over 12 weeks. The analysis addressed whether coprescribed benzodiazepines are associated with treatment response, antidepressant medication adherence, dropout, final dose of antidepressant medication, and report of antidepressant-related adverse effects. RESULTS Participants with GAD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were treated with a lower mean dosage of escitalopram and were less likely to complete the trial; there was no difference in adherence or treatment response. Participants with MDD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were less likely to tolerate a therapeutic dose of venlafaxine and reported more medication-related adverse effects; there was no difference in adherence, dropout, or treatment response. CONCLUSIONS Coprescription of benzodiazepines was associated with increased dropout in older patients with GAD and more medication-related adverse effects in older patients with MDD. However, with the systematic clinical attention offered in a clinical trial, they do not impede treatment response.

Several polysaccharides from natural sources such as algae, bacteria, and fungi have been considered as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration. They are safe, low-toxicity, biodegradable, and have biological activities. In this review, the bioactive polysaccharides derived from various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and algae were evaluated. Antiviral mechanisms of these polysaccharides were discussed. Finally, the potential use of microbial and algal polysaccharides as an antiviral and immune boosting strategy was addressed. The microbial polysaccharides exhibited several bioactivities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. Some microbes are able to produce sulfated polysaccharides, which are well-known to exert a board spectrum of biological activities, especially antiviral properties. Microbial polysaccharide can inhibit various viruses using different mechanisms. Furthermore, these microbial polysaccharides are also able to modulate immune responses to prevent and/or inhibit virus infections. There are many molecular factors influencing their bioactivities, e.g., functional groups, conformations, compositions, and molecular weight.

Among 9,122 responses, 71.5% indicated wanting a vaccine, below what previous modelling indicated as critical levels for progressing towards herd immunity. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. Teachers and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation. This study identifies factors to inform the public health messaging critical to improving uptake.","output":"Inadequate intention to receive Covid-19 vaccination: indicators for public health messaging needed to improve uptake in UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background New strains of different organisms, three of which has been caused by betacorona viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARSCoV- 2) have caused epidemics and pandemics. The COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in China in December 2019 has spread globally. Understanding its pattern of spread and how it affects the populace helps to guide formulation of strategies at curbing its spread, managing the disease and allocation of limited resources in tackling the pandemic. Methodology This is a review article about the epidemiology of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19). Various search engines were used to accumulate literature on the topic; these include PubMed, Google scholar, Ajol. Results As at October 29, 2020, SARS-CoV2 has spread to all continents except the Antarctica. Though a zoonotic disease, human to human transmission has resulted to this pandemic is via direct and indirect contact of droplets with mucosal surfaces. Most severe cases occur among the elderly, males, and people with co-morbid diseases. The average incubation period is 2-10 days. When compared with SARS-CoV (Ro: 2.3-3.7, mortality rate 11%) and MERS-CoV (Ro: 0.8-1.3, mortality rate: 34.3%), SARS-Cov-2 is a highly infective (Ro: as high as 6.5) with low mortality rates (average range mortality rates 1.83- 6.3%). Conclusion COVID-19 is a highly infective novel virus. Older persons and people with medical comorbidities are more susceptible to the severe form of the disease and mortality. As the second wave comes on, a sustainable measure of limiting the spread and consequences of COVID-19 should be more emphasized.","output":"SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS-2 (SARS-COV-2) INFECTION: AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes communities of practice (CoP) as a process to build moral resilience in healthcare settings.

Many countries implemented a rapid transition to distance education (DE), but the effects of such transition on family life remain largely underexplored. The current study used a cross-sectional, correlational survey design to explore the role of DE and family resources (parenting self-efficacy and family functioning) in perceived stress among Italian parents of first-grade children (N = 89). Results of hierarchical multiple regression indicated that, after controlling for stressful events experienced during school closure, parents' difficulty to manage children's DE was positively linked to levels of stress. However, this association became nonsignificant after adding family resources to the model, with more parental self-efficacy and good family functioning predicting less perceived stress. The findings underscore the importance of supporting positive resources within the family environment to reduce DE-related parental stress in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Parental stress during COVID-19: A brief report on the role of distance education and family resources in an Italian sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic reached the African continent in less than three months from when the first cases were reported from mainland China. As COVID-19 preparedness and response plans were rapidly instituted across sub-Saharan Africa, many governments and donor organizations braced themselves for the unknown impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have in under-resourced settings with high burdens of PLHIV. The potential negative impact of COVID-19 in these countries is uncertain, but is estimated to contribute both directly and indirectly to the morbidity and mortality of PLHIV, requiring countries to leverage existing HIV care systems to propel COVID-19 responses, while safeguarding PLHIV and HIV programme gains. In anticipation of COVID-19-related disruptions, PEPFAR promptly established guidance to rapidly adapt HIV programmes to maintain essential HIV services while protecting recipients of care and staff from COVID-19. This commentary reviews PEPFAR's COVID-19 technical guidance and provides country-specific examples of programme adaptions in sub-Saharan Africa. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may pose significant risks to the continuity of HIV services, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence and weak and over-burdened health systems. Although there is currently limited understanding of how COVID-19 affects PLHIV, it is imperative that public health systems and academic centres monitor the impact of COVID-19 on PLHIV. The general principles of the HIV programme adaptation guidance from PEPFAR prioritize protecting the gains in the HIV response while minimizing in-person home and facility visits and other direct contact when COVID-19 control measures are in effect. PEPFAR-supported clinical, laboratory, supply chain, community and data reporting systems can play an important role in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: As community transmission of COVID-19 continues and the number of country cases rise, fragile health systems may be strained. Utilizing the adaptive, data-driven programme approaches in facilities and communities established and supported by PEPFAR provides the opportunity to strengthen the COVID-19 response while protecting the immense gains spanning HIV prevention, testing and treatment reached thus far.","output":"PEPFAR's response to the convergence of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by single-stranded RNA virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The structural spike (S) protein of SARSCoV-2 plays a vital role in host cell entry, where the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor of the human cell binds to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the S1 domain and makes cell entry. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 is tenfold higher than the SARS-CoV-1-ACE2. Recent studies expose that the SARS-CoV-2 S D614G variant is highly infectious than D614 protein, also the D614G variant is highly stable than D614. So far, there is no effective viral-specific regimen for COVID-19. To overcome such problems, in our study, we have utilized the ZINC database to screen potent leads against the highly transmitting SARS-CoV-2 spike D614G protein, through a virtual screening procedure. We have applied three computational tools iGEMDOCK server, AutoDock version 4.2.6 and admetSAR to get active leads. The ZINC000150588351 (Elbasvir), ZINC000064540179 (Sofosbuvir analogue) and ZINC000137700912 (Sofosbuvir analogue) molecules have a greater binding affinity with the high binding energies of -8.22 kcal/mol, -8.13 kcal/mol and -7.64 kcal/mol respectively.

These studies identified atovaquone as a promising candidate for inhibiting viral replication. Methods Enrolled patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to atovaquone 1500 mg twice daily versus matched placebo. Patients received standard of care treatment including remdesivir, dexamethasone, or convalescent plasma as deemed necessary by the treating team. Patients agreed to allow collection of saliva at baseline and twice a day while hospitalized or up to 10 days. Saliva was collected and RNA extracted for viral load (VL) measurement by Real-time PCR. Our primary outcome was to examine the between group differences in log transformed VL(copies/mL) using generalized linear mixed-effect models of repeated measures from all samples. Additional analysis of Atovquone plasma concentrations were examined and correlated with viral load and body mass index (BMI). Results Of the 61 patients enrolled;41 were received atovaquone and 19 placebo. Overall the population was predominately male Hispanic with a mean age of 51 years. The two groups were balanced (Table 1) with regard to age, gender, race, co-morbidities, days from onset of symptoms, baseline oxygen requirements, and receipt of COVID-19 specific standard of care treatment. A higher proportion with diabetes was noted in the Atovaquone arm. The log10 VL was 5.25 copies/mL vs. 4.79 copies/mL at baseline in the atovaquone vs. placebo group. Although there was a decrease in VL over time, there was no differences between the atovaquone plus standard of care arm versus the standard of care arm (Figure 1). Additional analysis of atovaquone plasma concentration demonstrated a wide variation in atovaquone levels, inverse association between atovaquone levels and BMI (rho -0.44, p=0.03), and Day 5 concentrations and VL (rho -0.54, p=0.005). Figure 1. Mean viral load of COVID-19 over time of atovaquone (blue) vs. placebo (red). Table 1. Baseline characteristics Conclusion Although atovaquone showed promising in vitro antiviral properties for COVID-19, in this pilot study we did not detect a change in VL in patients who received atovaquone compared to placebo, possibly due to failure of patients achieve adequate drug levels.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, PMC PubMed Central, MEDLINE, WHO COVID-19 Database, Embase, Web-of-Science, COCHRANE LIBRARY, Emcare and Academic Search Premier (until June 30th2020). Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool the risk ratio and risk difference of individual studies. Risk of bias was appraised using the MINORS checklist. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 743 unique titles of which 10 studies (all on tocilizumab) comprising 1358 patients were included. Nine out of ten studies were considered to be of high quality. Meta-analysis showed that the tocilizumab group had lower mortality than the control group.

Since implementing precautions to reduce the spread of this disease, emergency departments have seen a decrease in the number of traumas. By evaluating the differences in the number of trauma admissions in different subgroups of patients, we can assess where to target messaging to increase compliance with these precautions. In this study, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma admissions. Methodology This was a retrospective review of the trauma database at our institution, a level 2 trauma center in Southern California, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of traumas. The inclusion criteria were patients activated as traumas, regardless of age. Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have complete information in the trauma database. Data were stratified by date into two groups: (a) COVID period (January to April 2020) and (b) pre-COVID period (January to April 2019). The primary endpoint of this study was to determine whether there was a significant change in the number of patients presenting as trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. This difference was analyzed and divided into subgroups based on age and trauma type. Results In our review, an average of 279 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April in 2019, and an average of 222 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April 2020 (p = 0.049). We found a significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with the chief complaint of fall and vehicular accident, but a nonsignificant difference in patients presenting as assaults or pedestrian accidents. There was also a significant decrease in the number of traumas in the 18-39 and 65+ age groups and a nonsignificant decrease in the 40-64 age group. It was also noted that the number of trauma admissions in May 2020 increased to 253 compared to 269 in 2019. This increase was most notable in the 18-39 and 40-64 age groups. Discussion As seen in the data, the most notable year-over-year difference was seen in March and April. In California specifically, a stay-at-home order was set in place in March, which was in conjunction with the WHOs declaration of a pandemic. An interesting finding was the significant decrease in patients with traumas in the age groups of 18-39 and 65+ from 2019 to 2020. There was a smaller, nonsignificant decrease in patients aged 40-64. This would be a good group to target with future messaging to increase compliance with health advisories. There was also a notable increase in the number of traumas in May 2020, signaling an end to the cooperation of the majority of people, also indicating that further measures needed to be enacted in all groups. Conclusions COVID-19 has disrupted social structures worldwide. As the pandemic continued, even the observers of stay-at-home and social distancing measures, the 18-39 age group, became fatigued with the guidelines and ventured out into the warming weather and summer activities. This difference in trauma admission due to COVID-19 between subsequent years can highlight the behavioral changes in our patient population and can be further extrapolated to target additional messaging to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Using the Decrease in Trauma Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Evaluate Compliance With Stay-at-Home and Social Distancing Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives During the current COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare has been transformed by the rapid switch from in person care to use of remote consulting, including video conferencing technology.

This rapid review aimed to identify the extent of use of video conferencing technology for delivery of group pain management programmes and provide an overview of its use. Methods A rapid review of the literature published up to April 2020 (PubMed, PsycINFO and PEDro) was performed. The search string consisted of three domains: pain/CP (MeSH term) AND Peer group[MeSH] AND Videoconferencing[MeSH]/Telemedicine[MeSH]/Remote Consultation[MeSH].

Results Literature searching yielded three eligible papers for this review. All studies had low methodological quality and risk of bias. Heterogeneity and variability in outcome reporting did not allow any pooling of data. The results demonstrated that videoconferencing for delivery of group programmes is possible, yet there is little extant literature on how to develop, deliver and measure outcomes of such programmes. Conclusions This review demonstrates that there is little evidence to support or guide the use of synchronous videoconferencing to deliver pain management programmes.

Scarce and/or costly control measures such as vaccines, anti-infective drugs, and social distancing must be allocated while epidemiological characteristics of the disease remain uncertain. Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. For vaccination of susceptible persons, the appropriate risk measure is force of infection; for social distancing, the appropriate risk measure is incidence of infection. Unlike existing methods that rely on detailed knowledge of group-specific transmission rates, the method described here can be implemented using only data that are readily available during an epidemic, and allows ready adaptation as the epidemic progresses.

DESIGN Nine SSD+CI listeners with at least 6 months of CI listening experience participated. Individual experimental FATs were created to best match the frequency-to-place mapping across ears using either sensitivity to binaural temporal-envelope disparities or estimated insertion depth. Spatial localization ability was measured, along with speech perception in spatially collocated or separated noise, first with the clinical FATs and then with the experimental FATs acutely and at 2-month intervals for 6 months. Listeners then returned to the clinical FATs and were retested acutely and after 1 month to control for long-term learning effects. RESULTS The experimental FAT varied between listeners, differing by an average of 0.15 octaves from the clinical FAT. No significant differences in performance were observed in any of the measures between the experimental FAT after 6 months and the clinical FAT one month later, and no clear relationship was found between the size of the frequency-allocation shift and perceptual changes. CONCLUSION Adjusting the FAT to optimize sensitivity to interaural temporal-envelope disparities did not improve localization or speech perception. The clinical frequency-to-place alignment may already be sufficient, given the inherently poor spectral resolution of CIs. Alternatively, other factors, such as temporal misalignment between the two ears, may need to be addressed before any benefits of spectral alignment can be observed.","output":"No Benefit of Deriving Cochlear-Implant Maps From Binaural Temporal-Envelope Sensitivity for Speech Perception or Spatial Hearing Under Single-Sided Deafness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a serious global health issue, and the societal interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic may have perturbed energy homeostasis, which affects the condition of obesity.

One is buying businesses at a price substantially below its intrinsic value (intrinsic value indicates the entity's future cash flows after estimating the number of accounting risk, macro-economic, managerial, and behavioral risk determinants). This Literature review, therefore, is organized to cover Behavioral, Accounting, Macro-economic, Volatility, and Management theories and Forecasting and ML techniques for clustering, predictions, and classification to support risk decisions using different models, e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, VAR, Facebook Prophet, ARCH and GARCH family models, etc. The literature review also establishes that the concept of risk is highly subjective and is perceived by different investors differently;it is not always entirely objective and outside the beliefs, cognitive and socio-cultural considerations requiring careful assessment before making investment decisions. However, examining the critical risk indicators would allow investors to make a more informed decision. The research gap and identified agenda for further review were defined and assessed using valuable ABCD and SWOT management frameworks. Consequently, the literature investigation findings are analyzed by offering recommendations for creating a comprehensive research agenda pertinent to long-term equity investors in the Indian Equity market.","output":"Literature Survey and Research Agenda of Risk Determinants in Indian Equities and Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In May 2015, an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in China, so rapid and reliable diagnosis of suspected cases was necessary. OBJECTIVES: An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). STUDY DESIGN: MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. RESULTS: Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.","output":"External quality assessment for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gut microbiome comprised of microbes from multiple kingdoms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Healthcare workers must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control prevention techniques given the high risk of transmission and potential morbidity associated with COVID-19. We present a case report highlighting the strengths and potential applications of telemedicine technology in a patient's evaluation during an ongoing emerging, novel infectious disease. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of fever. His presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a known exposure. Telemedicine evaluation was performed using InTouch Provider? software (InTouch Health, Goleta, CA, USA). The treating clinician was able to interact with the patient entirely through observations via web camera. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction testing was ordered and was performed by a dedicated triage nurse. The patient was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. Approximately 72 hours after discharge from the ED, the patient was contacted with positive COVID-19 swab results. CONCLUSIONS We present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19 in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place, this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit clinician exposure, decrease risk of transmission to key personnel, and assisted with preserving PPE supplies. Use of telemedicine affords multiple benefits in the effective diagnosis, evaluation, and potential prevention of spread of COVID-19.","output":"Diagnosis of a Case of Suspected COVID-19 Using Telemedicine Technology in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prediction of whether active NBA players can be inducted into the Hall of Fame (HOF) is interesting and important. However, no such research have been published in the literature, particularly using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The aim of this study is to build an ANN model with an app for automatic prediction and classification of HOF for NBA players. We downloaded 4728 NBA players data of career stats and accolades from the website at basketball-reference.com. The training sample was collected from 85 HOF members and 113 retired Non-HOF players based on completed data and a longer career length (15 years). Featured variables were taken from the higher correlation coefficients (<0.1) with HOF and significant deviations apart from the two HOF/Non-HOF groups using logistical regression. Two models (i.e., ANN and convolutional neural network, CNN) were compared in model accuracy (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC). An app predicting HOF was then developed involving the models parameters. We observed that (1) 20 feature variables in the ANN model yielded a higher AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.93C0.97) based on the 198-case training sample, (2) the ANN performed better than CNN on the accuracy of AUC (= 0.91, 95% CI 0.87C0.95), and (3) an ready and available app for predicting HOF was successfully developed. The 20-variable ANN model with the 53 parameters estimated by the ANN for improving the accuracy of HOF has been developed. The app can help NBA fans to predict their players likely to be inducted into the HOF and is not just limited to the active NBA players.","output":"Predicting Active NBA Players Most Likely to Be Inducted into the Basketball Hall of Famers Using Artificial Neural Networks in Microsoft Excel: Development and Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study investigates whether pharmacotherapy with liraglutide is similarly effective in reversing weight regain more than 6 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as revisional surgery aimed at restoring restriction. METHODS Ninety-five consecutive patients (11 male, 84 female; mean BMI 45  6 kg/m2) undergoing RYGB 9  4 years ago were treated for 24 months as follows: Patients, who gained less than 10% from weight NADIR, served as controls and were provided lifestyle counseling (DC, n = 30). The others were allowed to choose between three different treatment groups: daily s.c. administration of liraglutide (LG, n = 34); endosurgery using Apollo's Overstitch System? (ES, n = 15), or implantation of a Fobi-ring with pouch resizing (FP, n = 16). RESULTS Controls kept their weight stable during 24 months of study (- 0.1  1.7 kg/m2). Weight loss was 4.8  2.9 kg/m2 for LG and 5.5  2.9 kg/m2 for FP, both losing more than 85% of regained weight from weight NADIR (p < 0.001). In contrast, weight loss in ES was 1.0  0.9 kg/m2 (i.e., 20% of regained weight). Thirty-seven percent of FP experienced serious complications (p < 0.05) in contrast to the other groups. An improved prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in LG and FP (p < 0.02) 24 months after intervention. CONCLUSIONS Weight regain during more than 6 years after RYGB can be safely and effectively reversed with liraglutide. Compared with revisional surgery, pharmacotherapy with liraglutide was low risk and resulted in an important improvement in hypertension and dyslipidemia. Therefore, daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide are a valid option to treat weight regain after RYGB.","output":"Reversal of Long-Term Weight Regain After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Using Liraglutide or Surgical Revision.

Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","output":"Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 exhibit strong association with increased genome-wide mutation load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been extremely difficult to control.

On the other hand, there is a demand to incorporate Computational Thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the APEC InMside framework for CT: algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels, and that this is a powerful example of STEM integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families.","output":"Developing Computational Thinking to Help Tackle Pandemic Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate.

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and may have infected an intermediate host prior to spillover into humans. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 6 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood-brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed, and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, including IFN, IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8 expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission and localization into the olfactory bulb, recapitulating human neuropathology. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources determined the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease and neuropathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts in North America.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection, neuropathogenesis and transmission among deer mice: Implications for spillback to New World rodents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic, a disease that has become one of the world's greatest global health challenges, the role of the immune system has been at the forefront of scientific studies.

Specifically, we aim to: a) explore the psychosocial experiences of women in the early postnatal period; b) describe prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression; and c) explore whether psychosocial change occurring as a result of COVID-19 is predictive of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression. METHODS: A sample of UK mothers (N = 614) with infants aged between birth and twelve weeks were recruited via convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey design was utilised which comprised demographics, COVID-19 specific questions, and a battery of validated psychosocial measures, including the EPDS and STAI-S which were used to collect prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression and anxiety respectively. Data collection coincided with the UK government's initial mandated lockdown restrictions and the introduction of social distancing measures in 2020. FINDINGS: Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that a high percentage of mothers self-reported psychological and social changes as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures. For women who reported the presence of psychosocial change, these changes were perceived negatively. Whilst seventy women (11.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of depression, two hundred and sixty-four women (43%) reported a score of 13 on the EPDS, indicating clinically relevant depression. Whilst one hundred and thirteen women (18.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of anxiety, three hundred and seventy-three women (61%) reported a score of 40 on STAI-S, indicating clinically relevant anxiety. After accounting for current clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety, and demographic factors known to influence mental health, only perceived psychological change occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk of clinically relevant maternal depression (30%) and anxiety (33%). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first national study to examine the psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety were extremely high when compared to both self-reported current diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and pre-pandemic prevalence studies. Perceived psychological changes occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk for clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety.

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands.

Besides the usually high number of students (> 100), there is a preconception in considering the contents of physics courses very complex. These aspects, together with the fact that enrolment is required for an engineering study plan, make physics a course with low student engagement. This paper describes strategies and activities implemented in an Introductory Physics course (Physics EE), for first-year students of Industrial Electronics and Computers Engineering (Integrated Master) at the University of Minho to increase students' motivation, engagement and active learning. The implemented strategy includes: sharing the learning outcomes at the beginning of each lesson to help and guide students to successfully complete the tasks related to the topic and study more effectively;regular use of Audience Response Systems to encourage participation and give immediate feedback;use of in-class exercises to promote critical thinking and cooperation in the discussion of complex concepts;two-stage assessment (individual test followed by a similar test in groups), to promote collaborative learning and immediate feedback. These approaches took place during the 2018/2019 academic year in face-to-face teaching and in the 2019/2020 academic year in online teaching, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In both semesters, the students perceptions of the implemented changes were collected through anonymous questionnaires during the semester and at the end of term. The results indicate that, for both semesters, the students were satisfied with the implemented changes;they recognised the value of the immediate effective feedback to improve their learning experience and revealed high levels of satisfaction with the classes. These findings are consistent among students who attended face-to-face and online classes, and among students from different disciplinary areas, suggesting that the implementation of active learning strategies in this physics course may be transferable to different teaching contexts and scientific areas. ? 2021 University of Minho.

This study examines a specific cognitive skill that is of particular importance in DS, working memory, and the psychometric properties of a set of standardised measurements to assess working memory in individuals with DS. METHODS: Ninety children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years old with DS were assessed on a selection of verbal and visuospatial working memory subtests of standardised clinical assessments at two time points to examine feasibility, distributional qualities, test-retest reliability and convergent validity against a priori criteria. Caregivers also completed an adaptive behaviour questionnaire to address working memory subtests' associations with broader developmental functioning. RESULTS: The Stanford Binet-5 Verbal Working Memory, Differential Ability Scales-2 Recognition of Pictures, Stanford Binet-5 Nonverbal Working Memory and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-5 Picture Span measures met the most psychometric criteria overall across the full age and IQ range of the study. Although Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Sequential Order and Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Digits Backward met the fewest a priori criteria, follow-up analyses suggested greater feasibility in specific age and IQ ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Several working memory measures appear to be psychometrically sound and appropriate for use in clinical trials for children with DS, especially when focusing on raw scores. However, floor effects on standard scores and feasibility of some measures were problematic.

Myocardial involvement has been proved to be one of the primary manifestations of COVID-19 infection, according to laboratory test, autopsy, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the middle-term outcome of cardiac involvement after the patients were discharged from the hospital is yet unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate mid-term cardiac sequelae in recovered COVID-19 patients by CMR METHODS: A total of 47 recovered COVID-19 patients were prospectively recruited and underwent CMR examination. The CMR protocol consisted of black blood fat-suppressed T2 weighted imaging, T2 star mapping, left ventricle (LV) cine imaging, pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). LGE were assessed in mixed both recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The LV and right ventricle (RV) function and LV mass were assessed and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: A total of 44 recovered COVID-19 patients and 31 healthy controls were studied. LGE was found in 13 (30%) of COVID-19 patients. All LGE lesions were located in the mid myocardium and/or sub-epicardium with a scattered distribution. Further analysis showed that LGE-positive patients had significantly decreased LV peak global circumferential strain (GCS), RV peak GCS, RV peak global longitudinal strain (GLS) as compared to non-LGE patients (p < 0.05), while no difference was found between the non-LGE patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Myocardium injury existed in 30% of COVID-19 patients. These patients have depressed LV GCS and peak RV strains at the 3-month follow-up.

Yet the impact on mobility of different non-pharmaceutical countermeasures in the earlier stages of the pandemic is not well-understood. DESIGN: Trends were evaluated using Citymapper's mobility index covering 2nd to 26th March 2020, expressed as percentages of typical usage periods from 0% as the lowest and 100% as normal. China and India were not covered. Multivariate fixed effects models were used to estimate the association of policies restricting movement on mobility before and after their introduction. Policy restrictions were assessed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index as well as measures coding the timing and degree of school and workplace closures, transport restrictions, and cancellation of mass gatherings. SETTING: 41 cities worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Citymapper's mobility index. RESULTS: Mobility declined in all major cities throughout March. Larger declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with declines in mobility (r = - 0.75, p < 0.001). After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36 to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2 to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98 to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74 to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85 to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90).

CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the effect of public policy on mobility in the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19 transmission. By using Citymapper's mobility index, this work provides the first evidence about trends in mobility and the impacts of different policy interventions, suggesting that closure of public transport, workplaces and schools are particularly impactful.","output":"Using volunteered geographic information to assess mobility in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-city time series analysis of 41 cities in 22 countries from March 2nd to 26th 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleoli are nuclear domains present in almost all eukaryotic cells. They not only specialize in the production of ribosomal subunits but also play roles in many fundamental cellular activities. Concerning ribosome biosynthesis, particular stages of this process, i.e., ribosomal DNA transcription, primary RNA transcript processing, and ribosome assembly proceed in precisely defined nucleolar subdomains. Although eukaryotic nucleoli are conservative in respect of their main function, clear morphological differences between these structures can be noticed between individual kingdoms. In most cases, a plant nucleolus shows well-ordered structure in which four main ultrastructural components can be distinguished: fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar component, granular component, and nucleolar vacuoles. Nucleolar chromatin is an additional crucial structural component of this organelle. Nucleolonema, although it is not always an unequivocally distinguished nucleolar domain, has often been described as a well-grounded morphological element, especially of plant nucleoli. The ratios and morphology of particular subcompartments of a nucleolus can change depending on its metabolic activity which in turn is correlated with the physiological state of a cell, cell type, cell cycle phase, as well as with environmental influence. Precise attribution of functions to particular nucleolar subregions in the process of ribosome biosynthesis is now possible using various approaches.

Primary non-specific reported symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromal phase are malaise, fever, and dry cough. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Nonetheless, recent reports suggest an association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory and taste functions, although smell seems to be more affected than taste. These associations of smell and taste dysfunctions and CoV-2 are consistent with case reports describing a patient with SARS with long term anosmia after recovery from respiratory distress, with the observation that olfactory function is commonly altered after infection with endemic coronaviruses, and with data demonstrating that intentional experimental infection of humans with CoV-299 raises the thresholds at which odors can be detected.

Most of the participants had various misconceptions such as \\"females are more vulnerable to develop this infection, rinsing the nose with saline and sipping water every 15 minutes protects against Coronavirus, flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against this virus.\\" About one-third of participants (31.7%) had self-reported disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Many participants became more religious during this pandemic. Two-thirds of the study participants (68.1%) had good knowledge scores. Attitudes were highly positive in 93.1%, and practice scores were adequate in 97.7% of the participants. Participants' educational status was a predictor of high knowledge scores. Male gender and divorced status were predictors of low practice scores, and aged 51-61 years, private-sector jobs, and student status were predictors of high practice scores. Being Saudi was a predictor of a positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced status were predictors of a negative attitude. Higher education was a predictor of good concepts, while the older age and businessmen were predictors of misconceptions. Overall, our study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices, but several myths were also prevalent. Being a PhD and a Saudi national predicted high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. A higher education level was a predictor of good concepts, and students, private-sector jobs, and aged 51-61 years were predictors of high practice scores.

Here, we show that in mice early-stage CECs expand in anemia, have high levels of arginase 2 (ARG2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the spleens of anemic mice, CECs expansion-induced L-arginine depletion suppresses T-cell responses. In humans with anemia, CECs expand and express ARG1 and ARG2 that suppress T-cells IFN- production. Moreover, bone marrow CECs from healthy human donors suppress T-cells proliferation. CECs differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells potently suppress T-cell activation, proliferation, and IFN- production in an ARG- and ROS-dependent manner. These effects are the most prominent for early-stage CECs (CD71highCD235adim cells). The suppressive properties disappear during erythroid differentiation as more differentiated CECs and mature erythrocytes lack significant immunoregulatory properties.

Patients with severe COVID-19 suffer from life-threatening respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome in their lungs, a leading cause of COVID-19 mortality. This lung hyper-inflammation is induced by virus-caused massive tissue damage that is associated with uncontrolled cytokine release, known as a cytokine storm, through JAK/STAT signaling pathways.

Common circadian disrupting factors, such as night shift work and mistimed eating, can increase the risk of disease onset and symptoms. Disease can then, in turn, promote circadian disruption, leading to a vicious cycle of adverse circadian and overall health effects. This relationship suggests the importance of well-coordinated internal clock systems that maintain optimal synchrony with environmental and metabolic cues. In this review, we will recount the recent advances in circadian clock research and discuss how circadian clocks reciprocally interact with other signaling and metabolic factors to coordinate the daily rhythms of physiology. ABSTRACT: The circadian clock is a fundamental biological timing mechanism that generates nearly 24 h rhythms of physiology and behaviors, including sleep/wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. Evolutionarily, the endogenous clock is thought to confer living organisms, including humans, with survival benefits by adapting internal rhythms to the day and night cycles of the local environment. Mirroring the evolutionary fitness bestowed by the circadian clock, daily mismatches between the internal body clock and environmental cycles, such as irregular work (e.g., night shift work) and life schedules (e.g., jet lag, mistimed eating), have been recognized to increase the risk of cardiac, metabolic, and neurological diseases. Moreover, increasing numbers of studies with cellular and animal models have detected the presence of functional circadian oscillators at multiple levels, ranging from individual neurons and fibroblasts to brain and peripheral organs. These oscillators are tightly coupled to timely modulate cellular and bodily responses to physiological and metabolic cues. In this review, we will discuss the roles of central and peripheral clocks in physiology and diseases, highlighting the dynamic regulatory interactions between circadian timing systems and multiple metabolic factors.","output":"Multi-Modal Regulation of Circadian Physiology by Interactive Features of Biological Clocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Interferons are essential part of the innate immune and have antiviral and immunomodulatory functions. In the lack of definite medication for COVID-19, Interferons can be effective in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 and may decrease mortality of this disease. Material: and methods : This retrospective study was conducted on hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Loghman-Hakim hospital from 20 February 2020 to 20 April 2020, Tehran, Iran. Patients were selected from two groups, first group received Interferon -1a in addition to standard treatment regimen and patients of second group received standard care. The clinical progression of two groups during their hospital admission have been compared. Results: We studied total number of 395 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Out of this number, 111 patients (33.5%) died (31.3% of Interferon -1a (Recigen) group and 34.1% of control group). Mortality rate indicated no statistically significant difference between groups, however for patients who hospitalized more than a week, the rate of mortality was lower in Recigen group.

For example, in Fall 2020, the University of Connecticut operated remotely with most courses being offered in a distance learning format. In Fall 2021, students returned to campus for in person classes. Although there has been a great deal of speculation shared by students and faculty, the long-term impact of these abrupt transitions on student learning is largely unknown. In the present study, we begin to explore the impact of the pandemic on student engagement, investment, and performance in several undergraduate physiology courses by comparing student data from the Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 semesters. We analyzed the time students spent accessing synchronous and asynchronous learning materials, the frequency of student-instructor interactions, and scores on matched summative assessments. Furthermore, we explore the impact of course modality on these same metrics by comparing a flipped anatomy and physiology course to other courses offered in a traditional lecture and hybrid format. Our preliminary results indicate that while the overall student investment was comparable despite the instructional format, students engaged more consistently after returning to campus. However, the increased engagement does not correlate with assessment scores or other measures of student success (e.g., DFW rates). Our results contradict a widespread misconception that students were not adequately engaged by online learning during the 2020-2021 academic year. As pressure mounts to undo student support measures put in place during the pandemic, they may also serve as a warning to academic departments, graduate programs, and other stakeholders that the effects of the pandemic on students are ongoing, despite strong institutional desires for normalcy.","output":"Reflections on a Plague Academic Year: A Multiyear Comparison of Student Engagement, Investment, and Performance in Undergraduate Physiology Courses During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunoglobulin gene heterogeneity reflects the diversity and focus of the humoral immune response towards different infections, enabling inference of B cell development processes.

It now aims to eliminate malaria from the country by 2025. It launched the Malaria Elimination Action Framework (MEAF 2016-2020) in 2015 with strong political commitment targeting appropriate interventions on high-risk populations, particularly mobile and migrant groups. METHODS: In 2020, the household-level Cambodia Malaria Survey 2020 (CMS 2020) was conducted with the objective to assess the performance of malaria control activities using the indicators outlined in MEAF 2016-2020. The survey used a cross-sectional probability proportional to size approach drawing 4,000 households from 100 villages across the malaria-endemic districts of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3,996 households with 17,415 inhabitants were interviewed. Of the surveyed households, 98.4% owned a long-lasting insecticide-treated bednet or hammock (LLIN/LLIHN). However, only 79.5% of these reported sleeping under a net the previous night, with only 45.7% sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN). Given that forest visitors are at the highest risk of getting malaria, the survey also targeted this group. Of the forest visitor respondents, 89.3% brought an ITN along and 88.9% reported to have used a net during their forest stay. About 10.8% of forest goers had received a forest kit for malaria prevention from mobile malaria workers the last time they went to the forest. Knowledge about mosquito repellents was high among forest goers (62.5%) but the actual use thereof during the last visit to the forest was low (22%). While awareness about malaria prevention with LLINs remained high among most respondents, knowledge about malaria diagnosis and treatment was not universal. Source of malaria knowledge and its treatment was usually from a household member, followed by a village malaria worker or a primary health care center staff. Of those who had fever during the previous two weeks, 93.6% sought advice or treatment outside the home, and the most commonly reported source for advice or treatment was private providers (39.4%) followed by health center/district hospital (31.3%). CONCLUSIONS: ITN distribution and other malaria prevention interventions have largely benefited the high-risk groups including the forest visitors. Comparing the CMS 2020 results with the 2017 CMS results, it is clear that forest visitors use of LLIN/LLIHN has improved considerably. However, more needs to be done to ensure forest visitors be protected either through using LLINs or repellents while working and staying in the forest areas. Also, given that sleeping under LLINs has decreased over the past several years among the at-risk populations, the programme will have to develop strategies to ensure that the communities do not lower their guard against malaria as cases further dwindle in malaria prone areas. Heightened awareness amongst the general population will be critical for eliminating malaria in Cambodia without any possibility of malaria re-emergence or re-establishment.","output":"Cambodia malaria indicator survey 2020: Implications for malaria elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 which emerged suddenly with wide and deep effect on the life was stained by different clinical severity.

The present systematic review aims to provide an overview of studies that have used computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook a systematic search in five databases and included original articles in English that applied computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-one original articles utilizing computational drug methods for COVID-19 drug repurposing were included in the systematic review. Regarding the quality of eligible studies, high-quality items including the use of two or more approved drug databases, analysis of molecular dynamic simulation, multi-target assessment, the use of crystal structure for the generation of the target sequence, and the use of AutoDock Vina combined with other docking tools occurred in about 52%, 38%, 24%, 48%, and 19% of included studies. Studies included repurposed drugs mainly against non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV2: the main 3C-like protease (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir, Atazanavir, Nelfinavir, and Clocortolone), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Remdesivir and Ribavirin), and the papain-like protease (Mycophenolic acid, Telaprevir, Boceprevir, Grazoprevir, Darunavir, Chloroquine, and Formoterol). The review revealed the best-documented multi-target drugs repurposed by computational methods for COVID-19 therapy as follows: antiviral drugs commonly used to treat AIDS/HIV (Atazanavir, Efavirenz, and Dolutegravir Ritonavir, Raltegravir, and Darunavir, Lopinavir, Saquinavir, Nelfinavir, and Indinavir), HCV (Grazoprevir, Lomibuvir, Asunaprevir, Ribavirin, and Simeprevir), HBV (Entecavir), HSV (Penciclovir), CMV (Ganciclovir), and Ebola (Remdesivir), anticoagulant drug (Dabigatran), and an antifungal drug (Itraconazole).

This study investigates a novel LigaSure Small Jaw (LSJ) technique for sutureless thyroidectomy and compares the surgical complication rates between LSJ and conventional clamp-and-tie technique in one thousand consecutive neuro-monitored thyroidectomy patients. Five hundred patients received sutureless thyroidectomy performed with LSJ (Group L), and 500 patients received surgery performed with conventional clamp-and-tie technique (Group C). Complication rates of postoperative hematoma, hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy were compared between groups. The overall complication rates of hematoma, hypocalcemia (temporary/ permanent), and RLN (temporary/ permanent) palsy were 0.9%, 24.9% (24.6%/0.3%), and 1.7% (1.5%/0.2%), respectively. Group L and Group C significantly differed in postoperative hematoma rate (0.0% vs. 1.8%, respectively; p = 0.0026) and in postoperative hypocalcemia rate (20.1% vs. 30.0%, respectively; p = 0.0032). The incidence of RLN palsy did not significantly differ between Group L and Group C (1.38% vs. 2.08%; p = 0.2652). The overall surgical complication rates are low in neuro-monitored thyroidectomy.

METHODS: We obtained the number of confirmed cases and tests per day for almost every country in the world from Our World in Data. The Pearson correlation between the two time series was calculated according to the time delay to analyze the relationship between the number of tests and the number of cases with a lag. RESULTS: For each country, we obtained the time lag that makes the maximum correlation between the number of confirmed cases and the number of tests for COVID-19. It can be seen that countries whose time lag making maximum correlation lies in a special section between about 15 days and 20 days are generally been successful in controlling COVID-19. That section looks like a trench on the battlefield. CONCLUSIONS: We have seen the possibility that the success in mitigating COVID-19 can be expressed as a simple indicator of the time lag of the correlation between confirmed cases and tests. This time lag indicator is presumably reflected by efforts to actively trace the infected persons.","output":"Evidence of the importance of contact tracing in fighting COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world. Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization. It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission. As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.","output":"A Guide to Facial Trauma Triage and Precautions in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a robot designed for automated routine or emergency disinfection in closed premises. The robot is related to the combined type robots. The robot consists of two functional parts: a universal mobile platform (lower part) and a disinfector (upper part), which, if necessary, can be freely moved by personnel on 4 wheels. In the initial position, the upper part of the disinfection robot is at the charging station. The mobile robot drives up to the disinfector, ?hooks? it (puts it on itself) and moves along the planned route. The upper part of the disinfector will have its own independent intelligent system, separate from the mobile robot, which, when a person is recognized, stops liquid disinfection: in this case, the UV lamps turn through 180, the cylindrical body closes and ventilation of the disinfected air from the enclosed space is turned on. In addition, liquid disinfection is only enabled when detecting beds, tables and chairs. With the spray nozzles located at a height of 400 mm, the disinfector can carry out a simultaneous combined treatment of rooms with equipment and furniture, including high-quality processing of the lower surfaces of tables, chairs and beds. To improve the functional characteristics of robotic disinfectors and to simplify their design, a multifunctional robotic disinfector has been proposed. It was found that the result is achieved by the fact that in a multifunctional disinfection robot containing a mobile cart with an autonomous positioning and navigation system, a disinfection platform with a disinfection liquid spraying system and UV lamps with reflectors installed on it, the disinfection platform will have its own autonomous control and power systems ? 2022, Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies.

Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA. METHOD: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approachesBayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning. RESULTS: Our findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Swedens forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middlethe trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases. CONCLUSION: We show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden). Our study exhorts policy makers to take these results into account as they consider the implications of relaxing lockdown measures.","output":"Risk of a second wave of Covid-19 infections: using artificial intelligence to investigate stringency of physical distancing policies in North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pressure injury (PI) is still a significant public health problem to be solved.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Non-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Restricted visitation policies during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a major impact on the ways that Intensive Care Unit (ICU) clinicians communicated with patients and their families, requiring the use of innovative strategies to adapt to new communication structures. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to describe the impact of restricted visitation policies on communication and to identify strategies that could be used to facilitate better communication within Canadian ICUs from the perspective of those affected. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with critically ill patients, their families, and clinicians from 23 Canadian ICUs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between July 2020 and October 2020. We used inductive thematic analysis to identify relevant themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Forty-one interviews were conducted with three patients, eight family members, 17 nurses, and 13 physicians. Five themes were identified from the analysis: 1) Patient and family psychosocial and information needs; 2) Communication tools; 3) Quality of communication; 4) Changing roles and responsibilities of patients and nurses/physicians; and 5) Facilitators or barriers to implementing alternative communication. Participants identified strategies to leverage new videoconference technology and communication structures to preserve the quality of communication. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified challenges and opportunities related to communication between critically ill patients, families, and ICU clinicians due to the restricted hospital visitation policies during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, its dysregulation is associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Together, the ECS and the expanded endocannabinoidome (eCBome) are composed of genes coding for CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R, CB2R), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and the metabolic enzyme machinery for their synthesis and catabolism. The activation of CB1R is associated with adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS), which has limited the therapeutic use of drugs that bind this receptor. The discovery of the functional neuronal CB2R raised new possibilities for the potential and safe targeting of the ECS for the treatment of CNS disorders. Previous studies were not able to detect CB2R mRNA transcripts in brain tissue and suggested that CB2Rs were absent in the brain and were considered peripheral receptors. Studies done on the role of CB2Rs as a potential therapeutic target for treating different disorders revealed the important putative role of CB2Rs in certain CNS disorders, which requires further clinical validation. This review addresses recent advances on the role of CB2Rs in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease (PD), Alzheimers disease (AD), Huntingtons disease (HD) and addiction.","output":"New Insights and Potential Therapeutic Targeting of CB2 Cannabinoid Receptors in CNS Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peaked very early in comparison to the thresholds predicted by an analysis of prior lockdown regimes.

While it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception of an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two phenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any measure, be insignificant.

In the general population, higher potassium intake is considered protective for cardiovascular health. Due to the risk of hyperkalemia in CKD, limiting potassium intake is often recommended. However, given that poor cardiovascular function can cause kidney damage, following a low-potassium diet may be deleterious for patients with CKD. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on dietary potassium intake and CKD progression. Multiple databases were searched on 7 June 2019 and data were managed with Covidence. No intervention trials met the inclusion criteria. Eleven observational studies met the inclusion criteria (10 post hoc analyses, 1 retrospective cohort), representing 49,573 stage 1-5 predialysis patients with CKD from 41 different countries. Of the 11 studies, 6 studies reported exclusively on early CKD (stage 1-2), 4 studies separately reported analyses on both early and late (stage 3-5) CKD, and 2 studies reported exclusively on late CKD. A total of 9 studies reported risk of disease progression in early CKD; in 4 studies high potassium intake was associated with lower risk, while in 2 studies the low intake showed a higher progression of risk, and 3 studies reported no relation. In late CKD, results are mixed: 2 studies suggested benefit of higher potassium intake and 1 suggested benefit of lower potassium intake, whereas 3 studies were neutral. These results should be interpreted with caution, as considerations preventing firm conclusions include 1) the overall low range of dietary potassium intake, with all studies reporting an average intake below the 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives guidelines, and 2) the method used to assess potassium intake in most studies (i.e., urine) in late stages of CKD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 152 males with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the results of a positive PCR for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or computed tomography of the lungs hospitalized at the MSU University Clinic due to the moderate and severe COVID-19. Examination of the level of biochemical blood parameters (CRP, creatinine, urea, glucose, total testosterone (T)); CT of the lungs. To objectify the severity of the clinical symptoms, the NEWS2 distress syndrome severity scales and the original scale for assessing the clinical condition of patients with COVID 19 (SHOCS-COVID) were used. RESULTS The median T level in 152 examined patients was 2.14 [1.21; 3.40] ng/ml. In patients with a T level below the median, the CRP level was more than two times higher, and the D-dimer value was almost two times higher than in patients with T level above median. The duration of treatment in the hospital was longer in men with COVID 19 and an initial T level below the median than in patients with T about the median (13 days vs 10.5 days, p=0.003). Low T level was correlated with lung damage by lung CT. After improving the clinical condition, there was a linear increase in the level of T independent of its initial level. CONCLUSION Among men with moderate and severe COVID-19, a decreased testosterone level is detected in 46.7% of cases. Patients with low testosterone levels on admission have more severe COVID-19.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression (HRs) was performed to examine the relative risk of dying among women with anal cancer. Multivariable odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine odds of highly fatal disease (death within 12 months from diagnosis). RESULTS Non-Hispanic Black women (n = 1694) had greater risk of dying when compared with non-Hispanic White women (n = 15,821) with anal cancer (HR = 1.26, CI: 1.17-1.35), independent of other prognostic indicators. Stratifying by age at diagnosis, risk of death was highest for non-Hispanic Black women diagnosed younger than age 50 years compared with non-Hispanic White women of similar age (HR = 1.60, CI: 1.34-1.89), and lowest for Hispanic women (n = 1533) older than 74 years at diagnosis (HR = 0.80, CI: 0.69-0.92).

Some conflicts have emerged regarding the confrontation between adherence to hygienic measures and the performance of religious ceremonies, especially visit of Imam Reza shrine as the most important religious site in Iran. It seems that these conflicts have not been solved yet and are still at play. This survey study employs a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach to investigate pilgrims' justifications for making a pilgrimage to visit the shrine of Imam Reza during the spread of Coronavirus by means of content analysis. To this end, during the survey phase, 936 questionnaires were completed by the respondents and, in the qualitative phase, 46 pilgrims visiting the shrine of Imam Reza were interviewed in order to study the reasons for their presence in the shrine under such unique circumstances and analyze their justifications regarding their pilgrimage method in the shrine. The findings of the survey revealed that some pilgrims deemed the shrine to be so sacred that, basically, they would consider it free of any kind of disease. In contrast, the other pilgrims, while attesting that the virus can exist in the shrine, believed that it is possible to engage in pilgrimage as long as the required hygienic measures are observed. The findings of the qualitative phase revealed that pilgrims' justifications (rationalities for pilgrimage) can be categorized into four classes: tradition-devotion, repudiation-mitigation, obligation-imitation, and rational methods.

This would produce a cooling, which general circulation model (GCM) computations suggest could-subject to satisfactory resolution of technical and scientific problems identified herein-have the capacity to balance global warming up to the carbon dioxide-doubling point. We describe herein an account of our recent research on a number of critical issues associated with MCB. This involves (i) GCM studies, which are our primary tools for evaluating globally the effectiveness of MCB, and assessing its climate impacts on rainfall amounts and distribution, and also polar sea-ice cover and thickness; (ii) high-resolution modelling of the effects of seeding on marine stratocumulus, which are required to understand the complex array of interacting processes involved in cloud brightening; (iii) microphysical modelling sensitivity studies, examining the influence of seeding amount, seed-particle salt-mass, air-mass characteristics, updraught speed and other parameters on cloud-albedo change; (iv) sea water spray-production techniques; (v) computational fluid dynamics studies of possible large-scale periodicities in Flettner rotors; and (vi) the planning of a three-stage limited-area field research experiment, with the primary objectives of technology testing and determining to what extent, if any, cloud albedo might be enhanced by seeding marine stratocumulus clouds on a spatial scale of around 100100 km. We stress that there would be no justification for deployment of MCB unless it was clearly established that no significant adverse consequences would result.

With the proven entrepreneurial effectiveness in economic development and the efforts of scholars, policymakers and other stakeholders, competencies in entrepreneurship are becoming a set of essential learning objectives. In the digital era, entrepreneurship education can be made available in an online and blended format. Thereby, this study presents a systematic analysis of research focusing on blended and online entrepreneurial learning and teaching. Based on five keywords, collating an initial set of 121 articles, this systematic review details the research outcomes of the resulting set of 38 published research articles/contributions, where each described a specific online and blended learning environment. We obtained and analyzed the following information from each of these articles: definition of entrepreneurship education, context of study, methodology, applied technology, focused group, sample, outcome of entrepreneurship education and research rigor. Our findings showed that the current research status and achievements scholars have contributed in educational technologies utilized by online and blended entrepreneurship education can be summarized into three categories: social media, serious games and Massive Open Online Courses. In order to compare these technologies, we selected five examples from three educational technologies and utilized a marking sheet for evaluation and assessment. In general, it was found that Wiki was used to discuss entrepreneurial concepts and that Facebook was the most common social software in entrepreneurship education. In terms of serious games, FLYGBY and SimVenture facilitated the gamification and enjoyment of entrepreneurship activities the most. Finally, as Massive Open Online Courses platform, Coursera offers plenty of/online entrepreneurship education courses. In a nutshell, in online and blended entrepreneurship education, social media was utilized to facilitate cooperation amongst participants; serious games were used to enhance students enjoyment and engagement; and Massive Open Online Courses provided a platform as well as high-quality learning resources, anywhere anytime. Hence, each technology has advantages and challenges when we apply it to entrepreneurship education. We conclude that instructors and learners need to successfully compare and choose the most appropriate combination of technologies to achieve entrepreneurial course aims.","output":"Online and blended entrepreneurship education: a systematic review of applied educational technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pathogenesis is associated with an exaggerated immune response. However, the specific cellular mediators and inflammatory components driving diverse clinical disease outcomes remain poorly understood. We undertook longitudinal immune profiling on both whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of hospitalized patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Here, we report key immune signatures present shortly after hospital admission that were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Immune signatures were related to shifts in neutrophil to T cell ratio, elevated serum IL-6, MCP-1 and IP-10, and most strikingly, modulation of CD14(+) monocyte phenotype and function. Modified features of CD14(+) monocytes included poor induction of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme, COX-2, as well as enhanced expression of the cell cycle marker K(i)-67. Longitudinal analysis revealed reversion of some immune features back to the healthy median level in patients with a good eventual outcome. These findings identify previously unappreciated alterations in the innate immune compartment of COVID-19 patients and lend support to the idea that therapeutic strategies targeting release of myeloid cells from bone marrow should be considered in this disease. Moreover, they demonstrate that features of an exaggerated immune response are present early after hospital admission suggesting immune-modulating therapies would be most beneficial at early timepoints.","output":"Longitudinal immune profiling reveals key myeloid signatures associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rising threat of pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify therapeutics that are active in vitro and also translate in vivo.

We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivirs therapeutic time window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a clinically relevant dose, one drug C amodiaquine - significantly inhibited infection by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing.","output":"Human organ chip-enabled pipeline to rapidly repurpose therapeutics during viral pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (SARA) is the most feasible approach for removing aldosteronomas. AIM To analyse the advantages and disadvantages of surgical approaches to treating small adrenal tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2002-2011, 31 patients were operated on at Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics for aldosteronomas. Adrenalectomies were performed in the lateral laparoscopic (group A, n = 6), the endoscopic retroperitoneal (group B, n = 20), and the single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and SARA (group C, n = 5) approaches. Seventy five percent of patients were operated on by the same surgeon. The duration of adrenalectomies, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared. The possibility of minimally invasive adrenalectomies was evaluated. RESULTS According to the patients' age, body mass index and tumour size, the groups were equal. The average duration of surgery in group A was shorter than in groups B and C (91 23 min vs. 118 57 min vs. 144 88 min). Right laparoscopic adrenalectomy was longer than the left (105 26 min vs. 77 6 min), whereas right endoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy was shorter than the left (109 50 min vs. 126 57 min). The best cosmetic view was in group C. The SARA method was converted into the endoscopic retroperitoneal approach and then into the laparoscopic for one patient. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Evaluating the minimal invasion of the method, its abilities and simplicity of conversion into another type of endoscopic surgical way, the SARA approach should be the first option for removing aldosteronomas.","output":"Surgical treatment options for aldosteronomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic that has been raging in 2020 does affect not only the physical state but also the mental health of the general population, particularly, that of the healthcare workers Given the unprecedented large-scale impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital technology has gained momentum as invaluable social interaction and health tracking tools in this time of great turmoil, in part due to the imposed state-wide mobilization limitations to mitigate the risk of infection that might arise from in-person socialization or hospitalization Over the last five years, there has been a notable increase in the demand and usage of mobile and wearable devices as well as their adoption in studies of mental fitness The purposes of this scoping review are to summarize evidence on the sweeping impact of COVID-19 on mental health as well as to evaluate the merits of the devices for remote psychological support We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted a significant toll on the mental health of the population, leading to an upsurge in reports of pathological stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia It is also clear that mobile and wearable devices (e g , smartwatches and fitness trackers) are well placed for identifying and targeting individuals with these psychological burdens in need of intervention However, we found that most of the previous studies used research-grade wearable devices that are difficult to afford for the normal consumer due to their high cost Thus, the possibility of replacing the research-grade wearable devices with the current smartwatch is also discussed IEEE","output":"Potential Applications of Mobile and Wearable Devices for Psychological Support During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemiological compartmental model reported on May, 2020 was previously selected to estimate future outcomes to the dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic breakout in the city of S.

T he identification of patients at high risk for early recurrence, which are potential candidates to prompt anticoagulation, is crucial to justify the risk of bleeding associated with early anticoagulant treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate in patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF the association between findings at trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and 90 days recurrence. In consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF, TTE was performed within 7 days from hospital admission. Study outcomes were recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events (stroke or TIA) and systemic embolism. 854 patients (mean age 76.3  9.5 years) underwent a TTE evaluation; 63 patients (7.4%) had at least a study outcome event. Left atrial thrombosis was present in 11 patients (1.3%) among whom 1 had recurrent ischemic event. Left atrial enlargement was present in 548 patients (64.2%) among whom 51 (9.3%) had recurrent ischemic events. The recurrence rate in the 197 patients with severe left atrial enlargement was 11.7%. On multivariate analysis, the presence of atrial enlargement (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.06-4.29, p = 0.033) and CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.45, p = 0.018, for each point increase) were correlated with ischemic recurrences.

Prolonged physical proximity between adults and children under conditions of severe external stress, such as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic with shelter-in-place orders, may be associated with additional increased risk for child physical abuse. We hypothesized that child physical abuse rates and associated severity of injury would increase during the early months of the pandemic as compared to the prior benchmark period. METHODS: We conducted a nine-center retrospective review of suspected child physical abuse admissions across the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. Cases were identified for the period of April 1-June 30, 2020 (COVID-19) and compared to the identical period in 2019. We collected patient demographics, injury characteristics, and outcome data. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in child physical abuse cases between the time periods in the consortium as a whole or at individual hospitals. There were no differences between the study periods with regard to patient characteristics, injury types or severity, resource utilization, disposition, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Apparent rates of new injuries related to child physical abuse did not increase early in the COVID-19 pandemic. While this may suggest that pediatric physical abuse was not impacted by pandemic restrictions and stresses, it is possible that under-reporting, under-detection, or delays in presentation of abusive injuries increased during the pandemic. Long-term follow-up of subsequent rates and severity of child abuse is needed to assess for unrecognized injuries that may have occurred.","output":"Child physical abuse and COVID-19: Trends from nine pediatric trauma centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Global usage of bariatric surgery has been dictated for the past quarter century by National Institutes of Health recommendations restricting these operations to individuals with a BMI 35 kg/m(2). Strong evidence now demonstrates that bariatric procedures markedly improve or cause remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in part through weight-independent mechanisms, and that baseline BMI does not predict surgical benefits on glycemic or cardiovascular outcomes. This impels consideration of such operations as \\"metabolic surgery,\\" which is used expressly to treat T2DM, including among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2) who constitute the majority of people with diabetes worldwide. Here, we review available evidence to inform that consideration. RESULTS A meta-analysis of the 11 published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) directly comparing bariatric/metabolic surgery versus a variety of medical/lifestyle interventions for T2DM provides level 1A evidence that surgery is superior for T2DM remission, glycemic control, and HbA1c lowering. Importantly, this is equally true for patients whose baseline BMI is below or above 35 kg/m(2). Similar conclusions derive from meta-analyses of high-quality nonrandomized prospective comparisons. Meta-analysis of all pertinent published studies indicates that T2DM remission rates following bariatric/metabolic surgery are comparable above and below the 35 kg/m(2) BMI threshold. The safety, antidiabetes durability, and benefits on other cardiovascular risk factors from bariatric/metabolic surgery appear roughly comparable among patients with a BMI below or above 35 kg/m(2). Further studies are needed to extend long-term findings and measure \\"hard\\" macrovascular/microvascular outcomes and mortality in RCTs. CONCLUSIONS Extant data, including level 1A evidence from numerous RCTs, support new guidelines from the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit that advocate for the consideration of bariatric/metabolic surgery as one option, along with lifestyle and medical therapy, to treat T2DM among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2).","output":"Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery to Treat Type 2 Diabetes in Patients With a BMI <35 kg/m2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moaz Abdelwadoud, USA Usman Abubakar, Malaysia Nagesh Adla, India Ayaz Ahmad, Saudi Arabia Ali Ahmed, Malaysia A.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) concentration is usually undertaken at fixed time-points. Therefore, the extent of postoperative blood glucose fluctuation might be underestimated. To provide a more comprehensive assessment, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is beginning to be used. However, no previous studies have evaluated blood glucose concentrations using CGM following orthopedic surgery. Therefore, the differences between the maximum blood glucose concentrations measured using SMBG and CGM, and the mean amplitude of the glycemic fluctuation in patients with frank diabetes mellitus (DM) or pre-diabetes were evaluated. Blood glucose was measured in 20 patients who had undergone total hip or total knee arthroplasty (12 patients with DM and eight with pre-diabetes). Patients were fitted with a CGM device in the operating room, which was worn for 6 days postoperatively, and used to evaluate blood glucose concentration continuously. SMBG was performed simultaneously for the same period. RESULTS The mean difference between the maximum blood glucose concentrations measured using SMBG and CGM was 25.0  20.3 mg/dl (range, - 17 to 81 mg/dl), with the concentrations measured using CGM tending to be higher than those measured using SMBG (P = 0.04). Blood glucose concentrations measured using CGM tended to be higher than those measured using SMBG until postoperative day 2, and to decrease gradually after postoperative day 4. There were no significant differences in the standard deviation of the blood glucose concentrations between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Blood glucose concentrations > 200 mg/dl and larger fluctuations were more frequently recorded using CGM than SMBG, especially until postoperative day 2. Thus, CGM is more useful for the identification of high blood glucose concentrations and larger fluctuations.

It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse- labeled within the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, acquired numerous N- linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that less than 10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although mannose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not. Our findings support the proposal that the TGN is a distinct, fourth compartment of the Golgi apparatus that is insensitive to brefeldin-A.","output":"Compartmentation of the Golgi complex: brefeldin-A distinguishes trans- Golgi cisternae from the trans-Golgi network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first months of the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed a surge of social engineering attacks.

But the potential benefits of cTBS in reducing postoperative delirium have not been investigated. Therefore, we propose determining whether cTBS can prevent and/or treat postoperative delirium in senior patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants (65 years old or older) undergoing scheduled orthopaedic surgery (&#8805;2 hours, general anaesthesia) will be randomised to receive either cTBS or sham stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of the resting motor threshold. Every patient will receive 2-3 sets of stimulations during postoperative days (40 s per session, 3 sessions per set, 1 set per day). Participants will be assessed twice daily by a research assistant blinded to allocation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium measured by the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3.

METHODS The procedure combines extensive circular liposuction with circular skin resection immediately under the dermis. We classify lower trunk deformities using three parameters: (1) excess skin (in the horizontal direction, or both horizontally and vertically); (2) the body mass index (BMI); and, (3) skin quality (hyperlaxity or a normal tone). All patients can be divided into four groups, of whom groups I and II are the best candidates for the Lipo-Bodylift procedure. We also describe our perioperative management and patient outcomes, with a focus on postoperative complications. RESULTS Between January 2015 and January 2020, 100 patients underwent Lipo-Bodylift treatment. The median patient age was 41 years. The median preoperative BMI was 26.3 kg/m2. The median drainage duration and hospital stay were both 3 days. Of all patients, 30% experienced at least one complication, 2% of which were major. Of the minor complications, 27 patients evidenced wound dehiscence. Only (positive) smoking status was significantly associated with postoperative complications (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION We developed the Lipo-Bodylift technique after analyzing changes in the skin and subcutaneous fat after massive weight loss. The technique completes the arsenal of body contouring techniques, appears to be less invasive than the undermining that is usually performed during circumferential reconstruction of the lower trunk, and is associated with a lower rate of major complications.

Twenty-four embodied interaction prototypes were created to support remote videoconferencing by design students who were also, necessarily, active videoconferencing users during a COVID-19 lockdown. A reflective ordering process revealed a design space made up of six phenomenal aspects and three basic types of scaffolding. The analysis adds further details to existing design frameworks for embodied sensemaking. The paper provides guidance to designers who aim to create meaningful and theoretically grounded embodied augmentations of remote social interaction technologies. ? 2022 Owner/Author.","output":"Zooming in on embodied social sensemaking: Mapping the design space in the context of videoconferencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The burden of anemia in pregnancy is of global health importance. Tanzania is no exception. Its effects vary from one region to another due to the differing causes. Overall, it is a significant cause of maternal mortality. This study sought to assess the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic (ANC) in the Mkuranga district of the Pwani region of Tanzania. Methodology: This cross sectional study was conducted among 418 pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending the Mkuranga District Hospital and Kilimahewa Health Center. The outcome variable of interest was anemia in pregnancy defined as a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dl or less. Data was collected using face-to-face interviews with a standardized pretested questionnaire, and through blood samples collected for hemoglobin testing. Descriptive analysis was used to determine the prevalence of anemia while multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with anemia in pregnancy. Results: Anemia was prevalent among 83.5% of pregnant women attending the two major ANCs in Mkuranga district. Categorically, the hemoglobin of 16.3% of the included women was normal, 51.9% had moderate anemia, 24.4% had mild anemia, and 7.2% had severe anemia. Factors associated with anemia included being in the third trimester (AOR = 2.87, p = 0.026), not consuming vegetables (AOR = 2.62, p = 0.008), meat (AOR = 2.71, p = 0.003), eggs (AOR = 2.98, p = 0.002), and fish (AOR = 2.38, p = 0.005). The finding of unadjusted analysis revealed that women with inadequate minimum dietary diversity were having significantly greater odds of being anemic as compared with those with adequate dietary diversity (OR = 1.94, P = 0.016). Conclusion: More than 80% of pregnant women attending ANC in Mkuranga districts were anemic. Such unprecedented burden of anemia is associated with several factors, which include poor dietary practices such as not consuming iron-rich foods, for example vegetables, meat, eggs, and fish. Women in their third trimester were also more likely to suffer from anemia. This unprecedented burden of anemia in pregnancy can be addressed if efforts to improve feeding practices and early monitoring at the ANCs are sustained.","output":"The Burden of Anemia in Pregnancy Among Women Attending the Antenatal Clinics in Mkuranga District, Tanzania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toroviruses (ToVs) are enteric pathogens and comprise three species, equine torovirus (EToV), bovine torovirus (BToV), and porcine torovirus (PToV). In this study, a novel torovirus (antelope torovirus, AToV) was discovered from fecal samples of Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) with viral loads of 2.1010(9) to 1.7610(10) copies/g. The genome of AToV is 28,438 nucleotides (nt) in length encoding six open reading frames (ORFs) with 11 conserved domains in pp1ab and a putative slippery sequence ((14171)UUUAAAC(14177)) in the overlapping region of ORF1a and ORF1b. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated strains of AToV form a unique clade within ToVs and comparative analysis showed AToV share relatively low sequence identity with other ToVs in six ORFs (68.2C91.6% nucleotide identity). These data suggested that AToV represents a novel and distinct species of ToVs. Based on the M genes, evolutionary analysis with BEAST of AToV and other ToVs led to a most recent common ancestor estimate of 366years ago. Remarkably, recombination analysis revealed AToV was the unknown parental ToV that once involving in the recombinant events of HE genes of two Dutch strains of BToV (B150 and B155), which indicated that AToV occurred cross-species transmission and existed both in the Netherlands and China.

Passenger-specific area (PSA) is used as a QoS measure which is determined by considering passenger activities separately. As passengers perform various activities on the same platform space, there is a need to evaluate BRT platform QoS by considering the activities collectively. When evaluating transit station platforms, many researchers calculated PSA for the whole platform area, while very few researchers highlighted the importance of evaluating the platform as small, partitioned areas. By considering these findings and gaps in the literature, this study evaluates QoS of the platform on a cell by cell basis using PSA. We use timeCspace analysis and passenger-minutes of each activity to develop a methodology to determine PSA, by considering stationary passengers, circulating passengers, and passengers overall. To evaluate platform QoS, we define threshold service levels using passenger-minutes of activities and Fruins QoS criteria. For the case study BRT station, we find that PSA varies significantly between platform cells. It is evident from the results that it is important to identify highly congested areas in the platform and apply measures to improve platform QoS.","output":"TimeCspace analysis to evaluate cell-based quality of service in bus rapid transit station platforms through passenger-specific area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are experiencing marked declines, with potentially up to 11% of species currently under threat. Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.","output":"Pathogen prevalence in commercially reared bumble bees and evidence of spillover in conspecific populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sequelae and complications of COVID-19 infection continue to emerge during this pandemic era.

I will try to do so by focusing on three theoretical cornerstones of Espositos thought: the first concerns the evidence of a link between Europe, philosophy and politics. The second is deconstructive: it highlights the inadequacy of the answers of the most important contemporary ontological-political paradigms to the European crisis, as well as the impossibility of interpreting this crisis through theoretical-political categories such as sovereignty. The third relates more directly to the proposal of a new political ontology, which Esposito defines as instituent thought. Espositos discussion of political theology is the central theoretical nucleus of this study. This discussion will focus, in particular, on the category of negation, from which any political ontology that is based on pure affirmativeness or absolute negation is criticized. In his opinion, philosophical theories developed on the basis of these assumptions have proved to be incomplete or ineffective in relation to the current European and global philosophical and political crisis. Esposito therefore perceives the urgent need to propose a line of thought that is neither negatively destituent (post-Heideggerian), nor affirmatively constituent (post-Deleuzian, post-Spinozian), but instituent (neo-Machiavellian), capable of thinking about order through conflict (the affirmative through the negative).

METHODS: We compared 409 COVID-19 na?ve hemodialysis patients from 13 hemodialysis units in Israel to 148 non-dialysis dependent COVID-19 na?ve controls. Twenty-four previously infected (anti-nucleocapsid positive) hemodialysis patients were analyzed separately. Blood samples were obtained  14 days post vaccination (BNT162b2) to assess seroconversion-rates and titers of anti-S and neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Median time from vaccination to blood sample collection was 82 (IQR 64C87) and 89 (IQR 68C96) days, for hemodialysis patients and controls, respectively. Seroconversion rates were lower in hemodialysis patients compared to controls for both anti-S and neutralizing antibodies (89% and 77% vs. 99.3%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Antibody titers were also significantly lower in hemodialysis patients compared to controls: median 69.6 (IQR 33.2C120) vs. 196.5 (IQR 118.5C246), P < 0.0001; geometric mean titer 23.3 (95% CI 18.7C29.1) vs. 222.7 (95% CI 174C284), P < 0.0001, for anti-S and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated dialysis dependence to be strongly associated with lower antibody responses and antibody titers waning with time. Age, low serum albumin and low lymphocyte count were also associated with lower seroconversion rates and antibody titers. Hemodialysis patients previously infected with SARS-COV-2 had no difference in their seroconversion rates or antibody titers compared to COVID-19 na?ve patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates diminished and waning humoral responses following COVID-19 vaccination in a large and diverse cohort of hemodialysis patients, including those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Considering these results and reduced vaccine effectiveness against variants of concern, in addition to continued social-distancing precautions, a third booster dose should be considered in this population.","output":"Diminished and waning immunity to COVID-19 vaccination among hemodialysis patients in Israel: the case for a third vaccine dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indications for ileocolonoscopy were defined in 2002 by the Groupe Francophone dHpatologie Gastroentrologie et Nutrition.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection in asymptomatic cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic of a general hospital in a region with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (North Italy, first wave). Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of consecutive cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic of the oncology unit, General Hospital of Piacenza. All the patients having underlying cancer, without clinical suspicion of COVID-19, attending the outpatient clinic underwent nasopharyngeal swabs, from April 3, 2020 to June 3, 2020 and were included in this study. Results In a two-month period, 260 consecutive, asymptomatic (for COVID-19) cancer patients were tested for COVID-19. There were 160 women and 100 men; 218 patients were under active anticancer treatment, 32 in the diagnostic/staging phase waiting for treatment, and 10 treated with supportive care only. Ten of the 260 patients (3.85%) showed COVID-19 positivity. All but one (treated with hormone therapy) of the COVID-19 positive patients delayed anticancer treatment. The mean delay of anticancer treatment was 45.8627.66 days (range 21-87 days), and the mean time for viral clearance was 25.722.68 days (range 7-79 days). All the 10 patients with COVID-19 and cancer overcame the infection, and treated patients could restart anticancer treatment. Conclusion Our data indicate a high prevalence of COVID-19 in cancer patients in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Routine COVID-19 testing of cancer patients when asymptomatic allowed an early detection, isolation, and treatment, avoiding viral spread among other frail patients and among medical/nurse staff.","output":"Prevalence of COVID-19 Infection in Asymptomatic Cancer Patients in a District With High Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 virus diffusion is, nowadays, global and any clinical trial is potentially affected by the direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on over 150,000 online reviews about their satisfaction and experience posted by cruisers using so-called electronic Word of Mouth (e-WOM), the authors apply both a graphic and an econometric technique through input-output circular plots and discrete choice models. Findings: The main results show that cruisers behavior is influenced by multiple onboard attributes, such as the service crew, entertainment options, type of cabin, some characteristics of the ship (age, capacity) and the cruise line (Premium-Luxury versus mainstream), and, specifically, the quality and variety of the gastronomic experience. Practical implications: The results highlight that repeats cruisers are predominantly linked to a cruise company or a cruise corporation rather than a particular ship. This result provides information on the moderators that can influence the customers repetition behavior, which might be useful for planning revenue management and extending knowledge on hospitality loyalty in general and in the cruise industry in particular, specifically under the current uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey included 22 questions on five topics: consultation care, preinvasive cervical pathology, and cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The questionnaire was distributed to 1052 specialists in 14 Latin American countries. A descriptive analysis was carried out using statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 610 responses were received, for an overall response rate of 58.0%. Respondents favored offering teleconsultation as triage for post-cancer treatment follow-up (94.6%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (95.6%), and total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and defining adjuvant treatment with histopathological features in early stage endometrial cancer (85.4%). Other questions showed agreement rates of over 64%, except for review of pathology results in person and use of upfront concurrent chemoradiation for early stage cervical cancer (disagreement 56.4% and 58.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Latin American specialists accepted some alternative management strategies for gynecological cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reflect the region's particularities. The COVID-19 pandemic led Latin American specialists to accept alternative management strategies for gynecological cancer care, especially regarding surgical decisions.","output":"Alternative management for gynecological cancer care during the COVID-2019 pandemic: A Latin American survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Precautions in the Operating Room during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the technique of robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy.

RESULTS: Patients who eventually died from COVID-19 received CCP significantly later (3.95 versus 5.22 days after hospital admission) and had higher interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (28.9 pg/ml versus 102.5 pg/ml) than those who survived. In addition, CCP transfusion caused a significant reduction in the overall inflammatory status of the patients regardless of the severity of disease or outcome, as evidenced by decreasing C-reactive protein, IL6 and ferritin levels. CONCLUSION: We conclude that CCP transfusion is a safe and effective supplementary treatment modality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients characterized by better expected outcome if applied as early as possible.

Poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have shown improved clinical outcomes, a manageable toxicity profile, and favorable patient (pt)-reported outcomes versus chemotherapy in pts with gBRCA1/2 mutated HER2-locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. With the advent of PARPi, clinical guidelines have broadened eligibility criteria for gBRCA1/2 testing. However, limited information is available on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gBRCA1/2 testing rates. We assessed trends and factors associated with gBRCA1/2 testing in pts with HER2-ABC before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This retrospective study included pts from the Syapse LHN, a longitudinal database of pts with cancer cared for in community-based, integrated care delivery networks in 25 states in the United States. Pts were eligible for gBRCA1/2 testing from initial ABC diagnosis until death or date of last contact with the participating health system. Information on gBRCA1/2 testing was obtained from scaled sources and further curated by Certified Tumor Registrars. Logistic regression evaluated the associations between age at diagnosis, family Shistory of relevant cancer, race/ethnicity, median household income, health system, and diagnosis year with gBRCA1/2 testing among HER2-ABCs;models included hormone receptor status. Results: The study population included 1769 pts with HER2-ABC, including 577 pts with triple negative ABC initially diagnosed from 2010: 96% were women, 69% were non-Hispanic White, and 94% had an estimated median household income >$30, 000 USD;median age at initial diagnosis was 61 years. The percentage of pts ever gBRCA1/2-tested among those eligible increased over time: 26%, 28%, and 31% by end of 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Similarly, the percentages of new testing among eligible but not previously tested pts increased from 2018-March 2020, decreased from April-September 2020, and trended upwards thereafter (Table 1). In logistic regression models combining data from pre-and post-COVID-19 periods, family history of relevant cancer (odds ratio [OR]=1.9;95% CI, 1.5-2.4), younger age at diagnosis (>65 reference;<45: OR=12.8, 95% CI, 8.9-18.3;45-54: OR=6.7, 95% CI, 4.9-9.3;55-64: OR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.5-2.8), and diagnosis year of 2013 or later (OR=1.9, 95% CI, 1.4-2.6) were significantly associated with increased odds of gBRCA1/2 testing. Positive hormone receptor status (OR=0.5;95% CI, 0.4-0.6) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR=0.5;95% CI, 0.3-0.9) were significantly associated with reduced odds;associations with non-Hispanic Black ethnicity did not reach statistical significance (OR=0.8;95% CI, 0.6-1.1). Conclusion: Following the expanded eligibility criteria for gBRCA1/2 testing, testing rates increased from 2018 to 2019 and decreased only slightly during the national COVID-19 lockdown. Age at diagnosis, family history, diagnosis year, ethnicity, and hormone receptor status impacted the odds of testing. Given that gBRCA1/2 mutations are actionable, focused efforts should be developed to resume the pre-pandemic trajectory of gBRCA1/2 mutation testing.","output":"Germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC): A real-world study in the Syapse Learning Health Network (LHN)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background - Patients have been shown to shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens for over 100 days after resolution of clinical disease (1, 2). How this relates to anterior nares and oral fluid specimens has not previously been investigated. Methods - We prospectively collected oral fluid, anterior nares, NP swab and serum specimens from 1,326 individuals at 2 'drive-through' testing locations. The Curative SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Curative Assay)(3) on oral fluid and anterior nares specimens was compared to the EURORealTime SARS-CoV-2 Assay (EuroRT Assay)(4) on anterior nares and NP specimens. Viral culture and IgG serology were used to assess infectious potential and stage of disease. Additionally we investigated differences in viral RNA detection between specimen types, both early (< 21 days) and late (> 21 days) in SARS-CoV-2 infection, by using an employee surveillance program with daily SARS-CoV-2 testing to precisely determine infection date, even without symptoms. We prospectively collected oral fluid, anterior nares and NP swab specimens from 165 subjects with early infections and 22 subjects with late infections. Specimens were tested using the Curative Assay with the 'high-sensitivity' Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Hologic Assay)(5) on an NP swab used as the comparator. Late infection specimens were also tested with EuroRT and Zymo Quick SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR Kit (Zymo) (6) Assays. Results - The 'drive-through' study showed similar sensitivities of oral fluid and anterior nares specimens on the Curative Assay to anterior nares specimens tested with the EuroRT Assay. However NP specimens tested with the same EuroRT assay produced 20-30% more positives. Incorporating viral culture and serology data to exclude NP RT-PCR positives that are not infectious or late in the course of disease showed a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for of 98.2% and 96.2% and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of 97.6% and 98.1% for anterior nares and oral fluid specimens, respectively. Within 21 days of infection, the Curative Assay showed a PPA and NPA of 100% and 100%, respectively for oral fluid; of 100% and 99% respectively for anterior nares; and of 98.2% and 99.0%, respectively in nasopharyngeal specimens compared to an NP specimen on the Hologic Assay. 29 positives were asymptomatic and showed 100% PPA and 100% NPA for all specimen types. After 21 days from infection onset, significant divergence between NP and other specimen types occurred on all 4 assays. Out of 22 paired sample sets, 18, 13, 8 and 4 NP specimens were positive on the Curative, Zymo, Hologic and EuroRT assays, respectively, compared to only 3, 2, 0 and 1 positive anterior nares specimens. Only one oral fluid sample was positive in both the Curative and Zymo assays. Conclusions - We used a unique population to show significant divergence between NP specimens and anterior nares or oral fluid specimens >21 days from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears to be biological variation and is independent of assay used. This has significant public health implications for the use of NP specimens in community testing programs and policy implications for evaluation of novel specimen types and tests where the use of NP swabs as a comparator may say more about the study population than the assay or specimen type to be evaluated and may unnecessarily limit access to testing.","output":"Post-Disease Divergence in SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection between Nasopharyngeal, Anterior Nares and Saliva/Oral Fluid Specimens - Significant Implications for Policy & Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the dynamics of a COVID-19 stochastic model with isolation strategy.

To model the interaction between fat grafting and breast cancer cells, two approaches were employed. In the first approach, graded numbers of viable MDA-MB-231 or BT-474 cells were admixed directly into human fat grafts and injected subcutaneously into immune-deficient mice to determine if the healing graft is a supportive environment for the tumor. In the second approach, graded doses of MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in Matrigel and injected into the mammary fat pads of mice. Two weeks after the tumor cells engrafted, 100 L of human adipose tissue was grafted into the same site. Histologically, MDA-MB-231 cells seeded within fat grafts were observed and stained positive for human-specific pan-cytokeratin and Ki67. The BT-474 cells failed to survive when seeded within fat grafts at any dose. In the second approach, MDA-MB-231 cells had a strong trend toward lower Ki67 staining at all doses. Regression analysis on all groups with fat grafts and MDA-MB-231 revealed fat tissue was associated with lower cancer cell Ki67 staining. Healing fat grafts do not support the epithelial BT-474 cell growth, and support the mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cell growth only at doses ten times greater than in Matrigel controls. Moreover, fat grafts in association with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells already present in the wound resulted in decreased tumor proliferation and increased fibrosis. These findings suggest that clinical fat grafting does not induce breast cancer cell growth, and may even have a suppressive effect.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are often used by healthcare professionals to assess the impact of a patients condition (and treatment) on quality of life. However, we are not aware of any measures developed specifically for people requiring lower limb reconstructive surgery. Consequently, it is not clear the extent to which current PROMs accurately and specifically measure the outcomes that are important to these patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PROLLIT (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for Lower Limb Reconstruction) involves three phases: to explore what is important to patients with regard to quality of life (phase 1), ascertain whether current measures adequately capture these experiences (phase 2) and if not begin, the development of a new PROM (phase 3). The population of interest is people requiring, undergoing or after undergoing reconstructive surgery for a lower limb condition. In this paper, we describe phase 1, which aims to develop a conceptual framework to identify and map what is important to this group with regard to social interactions, employment, perceived health and quality of life after condition onset/injury and throughout recovery. The conceptual framework will be developed through three steps: (step A) a qualitative evidence synthesis, (step B) a qualitative study with patients and staff to explore patients views and experiences of lower limb reconstructive surgery and (step C) a round table discussion with key stakeholders where findings from step A and step B will be brought together and used to finalise the conceptual framework.

Yet, we perceive vivid illusory motion in stationary, periodic luminance gradients that contain no true motion. This illusion is shared by diverse vertebrate species, but theories proposed to explain this illusion have remained difficult to test. Here, we demonstrate that in the fruit fly Drosophila, the illusory motion percept is generated by unbalanced contributions of direction-selective neurons' responses to stationary edges. First, we found that flies, like humans, perceive sustained motion in the stationary gradients. The percept was abolished when the elementary motion detector neurons T4 and T5 were silenced. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that T4 and T5 neurons encode the location and polarity of stationary edges. Furthermore, our proposed mechanistic model allowed us to predictably manipulate both the magnitude and direction of the fly's illusory percept by selectively silencing either T4 or T5 neurons. Interestingly, human brains possess the same mechanistic ingredients that drive our model in flies. When we adapted human observers to moving light edges or dark edges, we could manipulate the magnitude and direction of their percepts as well, suggesting that mechanisms similar to the fly's may also underlie this illusion in humans. By taking a comparative approach that exploits Drosophila neurogenetics, our results provide a causal, mechanistic account for a long-known visual illusion.

Although lab-based testing will always be the gold standard of experimental precision, several protocols have evolved to enable supervised online testing for paradigms that require direct observation and/or interaction with participants. However, many tasks can be completed online in an unsupervised way, reducing reliance on lab-based resources (e.g., personnel and equipment), increasing flexibility for families, and reducing participant anxiety and/or demand characteristics. The current project demonstrates the feasibility and utility of unsupervised online testing by incorporating a classic change-detection task that has been well-validated in previous lab-based research. In addition to serving as proof-of-concept, our results demonstrate that large online samples are quick and easy to acquire, facilitating novel research questions and speeding the dissemination of results. To accomplish this, we assessed visual working memory (VWM) in 4- to 10-year-old children in an unsupervised online change-detection task using arrays of 1C4 colored circles. Maximum capacity (max K) was calculated across the four array sizes for each child, and estimates were found to be on-par with previously published lab-based findings. Importantly, capacity estimates varied markedly across array size, with estimates derived from larger arrays systematically underestimating VWM capacity for our youngest participants. A linear mixed effect analysis (LME) confirmed this observation, revealing significant quadratic trends for 4- through 7-year-old children, with capacity estimates that initially increased with increasing array size and subsequently decreased, often resulting in estimates that were lower than those obtained from smaller arrays. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these regressions may have been based on explicit guessing strategies for array sizes perceived too difficult to attempt for our youngest children. This suggests important interactions between VWM performance, age, and array size, and further suggests estimates such as optimal array size might capture both quantitative aspects of VWM performance and qualitative effects of attentional engagement/disengagement. Overall, findings suggest that unsupervised online testing of VWM produces reasonably good estimates and may afford many benefits over traditional lab-based testing, though efforts must be made to ensure task comprehension and compliance.","output":"Unsupervised Online Assessment of Visual Working Memory in 4- to 10-Year-Old Children: Array Size Influences Capacity Estimates and Task Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a nonparametric nonlinear VAR prewhitened long-run variance (LRV) estimator for the construction of standard errors robust to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity that can be used for hypothesis testing in a variety of contexts including the linear regression model.

It is often considered as a \\"new dimension\\" of health care, particularly in its ability to provide health information. In 2017, the top social media sites utilized by pediatric orthopaedic surgeons included Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. In our study, we analyze the current social media usage, trends in Instagram and TikTok content, and the perceptions on social media usage among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. METHODS: The Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) membership directory was searched for the presence of social media. A review of all Instagram and TikTok posts made by the POSNA members were reviewed. A survey regarding the perception of social media networks and content was distributed to all POSNA members. RESULTS: A total of 1231 POSNA members actively practicing in the United States were included in our study. In all, 327 (26.6%) had a LinkedIn profile, 34 (2.8%) had a professional Facebook profile, 15 (1.2%) had a public Instagram account, 0 (0%) had TikTok, and 72 (5.8%) had a professional Twitter account. Fifteen POSNA members with public Instagram accounts had 10,878 followers. A total of 907 Instagram posts were made, 134 (14.8%) of which were education and 462 (50.9%) of which were personal or political. The perception of various social media networks such as Instagram (3.02), Facebook (3.16), and LinkedIn (3.51) were positive on a 5-point Likert scale, while perceptions of TikTok (2.36) and Twitter (2.99) were negative. Educational posts on Instagram (3.19) and Facebook (3.37) were positive. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an update to the utilization of social media by pediatric orthopaedists. Use of Instagram and TikTok accounts remain rare. Educational posts, when hosted on an appropriate social media platform, are perceived positively among pediatric orthopaedists.

Comparative global data are scarce and so this review aimed to summarize current evidence on the association between occupational exposure to solar UVR and the development of KC, with a specific focus on geographic location and skin colour. Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for potentially relevant records. Extracted data was summarised by study, country, and region. We included one prospective cohort study and 18 case-control studies (N=15,233) from 12 countries in regions where the majority of the population is white-skinned (Americas, Europe, and Oceania). Eighteen of the 19 studies reported effect estimates suggesting an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and/or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among outdoor workers. Only 11 studies found a significantly increased risk and many had imprecise estimates. There was a significantly increased risk of BCC and SCC in individual studies in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Europe, and Southern Europe but not across regions or countries. Overall, 95% of studies reported higher risks among outdoor workers, although the increases in risk were statistically significant in just over half of studies. Well-designed and sufficiently powered occupational case-control and cohort studies with adequate adjustment for confounding factors and other risk factors are required to provide more accurate risk estimates for occupational KC.","output":"Global evidence on occupational sun exposure and keratinocyte cancers: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The study was to report the clinical features and post-operative outcomes in military personnel admitted to the Ocular Trauma Center of Glhane Training and Research Hospital after sustaining combat injuries in urban warfare. METHODS: This is a retrospective, non-comparative, interventional case series analyzing Turkish military personnel transferred to our tertiary ocular trauma center from the warfare zone and combat support hospitals. Ocular injuries were subdivided into zones and ocular trauma classification. RESULTS: There were 103 combat ocular injuries in 74 military personnel. The average age was 27.314.64 years (range; 21-48 years), and all were men (100%). The average follow-up was 529.34213.98 days (288-1464 days). There were 84 open-globe and 19 closed-globe injuries. Thirty-six (34.9%) had final vision of 20/40 or better. Pars plana vitrectomy was the most common surgery (79.6%). Five eyes underwent evisceration, and seven eyes developed phthisis bulbi. The globe survival rate was 88.3%. Zone III injuries (32.2%) were the most common cause of unfavorable visual outcomes, and most injuries were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) (59.2%). These devices also had the worst impact on globe survival and visual improvement. These eyes had a higher likelihood ratio of requiring globe removal surgery or developing phthisis bulbi [odds ratio: 21.5 (95% CI: 1.23-373)]. Two eyes that underwent keratoprosthesis-assisted pars plana vitrectomy followed by penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) during the same session developed PKP failure while failure was not seen in any of the cases that underwent PKP in a later session. CONCLUSION: Ocular injuries related to IEDs had the most significant impact on both visual and anatomic prognoses, and globe survival was less likely in eyes with zone III trauma, in which intraocular foreign bodies penetrated the choroid. There is a higher pos-sibility of PKP failure if this procedure is performed during the same session as other ocular surgery.","output":"Combat-related ocular trauma and visual outcomes during counter-terrorism urban warfare operations in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Fever is a very common reason for emergency consultation during pregnancy, and may be associated with maternal, obstetrical and/or fetal adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies and to analyze the maternal or fetal complications of fever in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single center study including all patients who consulted for fever above 38 C during pregnancy in the gynecological emergency ward from August 2016 to July 2017. RESULTS: A total of 100 pregnant women who consulted for fever were included. The etiologies were common viral infections (37 %), influenza (21 %), pyelonephritis (11 %), viral gastroenteritis (6%), chorioamnionitis (5%), other (5%). The etiology was unknown for 15 %. Fever was confirmed during consultation in 45/100 patients (45 %). Among patients with confirmed fever, 21/45 (47 %) were hospitalized with a median stay of 3 days [IQR 2-4] and 10/45(22 %) developed fetal or maternal complications. Probabilistic antibiotics were delivered for 34/45, 76 % patients. Only 14/45, 31 % had confirmed bacterial infections. Of the 32 patients with confirmed fever who had no etiologic diagnosis at the initial work-up in the emergency room, 19/32, 59 % received presumptive treatment with amoxicillin against Listeria monocytogenes. None had confirmed listeriosis, and all were probably common viral infections. Among all patients, the complications rate was 13 % and 22 % in the subgroup with fever confirmed at presentation.

ED has been demonstrated in patients with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Besides classical risk factors, ED is affected by chronic inflammatory diseases and acute infections, particularly viral diseases. Causes of ED include oxidative stress, inflammation, and shear stress, which decrease the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Markers of ED have been sought, particularly circulating markers. Using these tests, it is possible to evaluate the response to harmful effects of risk factors and the effects of treatment on vessel wall function. Endothelial dysfunction is significantly and directly correlated with the occurrence of cardiac events and the risk of cardiac events increase as ED worsens. Because endothelial function plays a central role in atherogenesis it became a therapeutic target. Endothelial dysfunction is reversible and its improvement may be achieved by elimination of risk factors, inhibitors of endothelium-derived contracting factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme), smoking cessation, lipid-lowering drugs, diet, and physical exercise.

Virus infectivity is mediated by the binding of Spike transmembrane glycoprotein to specific protein receptors present on cell host surface. Spike is a homotrimer that emerges from the virion, each monomer containing two subunits named S1 and S2, which are related to cell recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 is subdivided in domains S1A (or NTD) and S1B (or RBD), with experimental and in silico studies suggesting that the former binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, such as CD147, whereas the latter binds to ACE2 receptor. Recent findings indicate that the ABO blood system modulates susceptibility and progression of infection, with type-A individuals being more susceptible to infection and/or manifestation of a severe condition. Seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this susceptibility, we carried out an extensive bibliographic survey on the subject. Based on this survey, we hypothesize that the correlation between the ABO blood system and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be presumably explained by the modulation of sialic acid-containing receptors distribution on host cell surface induced by ABO antigens through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, which could maximize or minimize the virus Spike protein binding to the host cell. This model could explain previous sparse observations on the molecular mechanism of infection and can direct future research to better understand of COVID-19 pathophysiology.","output":"The influence of ABO blood groups on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: A molecular hypothesis based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaders at UCSF offer insights from their experience in developing guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 testing to ensure patient and staff safety as they resume scheduling surgical procedures for nonCCovid-19 conditions that had been put on hold as the coronavirus pandemic developed.

Although no reliable evidence has been found, it is considered that combining chemotherapeutic drugs with Chinese herbs can significantly improves the cure rate and the clinical therapeutic effect. METHODS: Multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB, n = 258) patients with Qi-yin deficiency syndrome will be randomly assigned into a treatment group (n = 172) or control/placebo group (n = 86). The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs granules (1 + 3 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs placebo (1 + 3 placebo granules). In addition, MDR-PTB (n = 312) patients with Yin deficiency lung heat syndrome will be randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 208) or control/placebo (n = 104) group. The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic regimen combined with Chinese herbs granules (2 + 4 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs and Chinese herbs placebo (2 + 4 placebo granules). The primary outcome is cure rate, the secondary outcomes included time to sputum culture conversion, lesion absorption rate and cavity closure rate. BACTEC? MGIT? automated mycobacterial detection system will be used to evaluate the M.tb infection and drug resistance. Chi-square test and Cox regression will be conducted with SAS 9.4 Statistical software to analyze the data. DISCUSSION: The treatment cycle for MDR-PTB using standardized modern medicine could cause lengthy substantial side effects. Chinese herbs have been used for many years to treat MDR-PTB, but are without high-quality evidence. Hence, it is unknown whether Chinese herbs enhances the clinical therapeutic effect of synthetic drugs for treating MDR-PTB. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate the clinical therapeutic effect of combining Chinese herbs and chemotherapeutic drugs to treat MDR-PTB cases. It will assist in screening new therapeutic drugs and establishing treatment plan that aims to improve the clinical therapeutic effect for MDR-PTB patients.

However, no data are available on the learning curve (LC) for EUS-GE. Defining it is necessary for the creation of adequate subspecialty training programs and quality assurance. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained dataset of patients that underwent EUS-GE at one tertiary referral center. Primary outcome was the LC for EUS-GE defined by the number of cases needed to achieve proficiency and mastery using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Moving average graphs and sequential time-block analysis were also performed to assess procedural time. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety of EUS-GE. RESULTS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients underwent EUS-GE, mostly for malignant GOO. For consistency, 14 patients were excluded from analysis (noncautery-assisted EUS-GE 11, surgical anatomy 3). The same endoscopist performed all procedures using the same freehand technique. Technical success was achieved in 68 out of 73 (93%) patients. Immediate AEs occurred in 4 (5.5%) patients, whereas late AEs occurred only in 1 (1%) patient, all managed conservatively or endoscopically. All immediate adverse events occurred during the first 39 cases. Clinical success (defined as resuming at least oral liquid diet within a week) was achieved in 97% of patients. The mean procedural time was 36 minutes (SD 24). Evaluation of the CUSUM curve revealed that 25 cases were needed to achieve proficiency and 40 cases to achieve mastery. These results were confirmed with the average moving curve and sequential time-block analysis. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, data on the learning curve for EUS-GE.

Inflammation can alter the metabolism of tryptophan through the oxidative kynurenine pathway to compounds with neurotoxic and neuroprotective activity and compromise serotonin (5-HT) synthesis. Here we investigate the role of serotonergic and kynurenine pathways in the maternal immune activation (MIA) animal model of schizophrenia. The potential reversion exerted by long-term antipsychotic treatment was also evaluated. MIA was induced by prenatal administration of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) in mice. Expression of different proteins and the content of different metabolites involved in the function of serotonergic and kynurenine pathways was assessed by RT-PCR, immunoblot and ELISA analyses in frontal cortex of the offspring after puberty. MIA decreased tissue 5-HT content and promoted changes in the expression of serotonin transporter, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. Expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) was increased by poly (I:C) whereas kynurenine aminotransferase II and its metabolite kynurenic acid were not altered. Long-term paliperidone was able to counteract MIA-induced changes in 5-HT and KMO, and to increase tryptophan availability and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 expression in poly (I:C) mice but not in controls. MIA-induced increase of the cytotoxic risk ratio of kynurenine metabolites (quinolinic/kynurenic acid) was also reversed by paliperidone. MIA induces specific long-term brain effects on serotonergic activity. Such effects seem to be related with alternative activation of the kynurenine metabolic pathway towards a cytotoxic status.

Review templates were well used, but the only study to assess health outcomes showed no effect. Templates can improve documentation of key measures, and act as a reminder tool; however, this can restrict the review process, and risks prioritising healthcare professional agendas over patients. Templates may also limit opportunities to discuss individuals' concerns about living with their condition, and act as a barrier to providing patient-centred care.

DESIGN A controlled before and after trial was conducted. Participants in the intervention (n = 99) received a leaflet based on the HAPA and asking them to form an action plan identifying where, when, and how they would seek vaccination.

RESULTS The HAPA intervention resulted in greater changes on measures of risk perception, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and intention than the comparison condition. Stronger intentions to obtain vaccination were explained by changes in outcome expectancies, perceived self-efficacy for arranging time and transportation, and planning. No significant difference in vaccination rates was observed between two groups. Influenza vaccination was directly predicted by self-efficacy and intention.

Pathogenic bacteria are targets during classical phage therapy. Metastatic tumors are potential future targets, during use of drug delivery vehicles (DDVs) that are phage derived. Phage therapy has, to date, only sometimes been successful. One cause of failure is low phage persistence. A three-step strategy for increasing persistence is to increase (1) the speed of lytic phage isolation, (2) the diversity of phages isolated, and (3) the effectiveness and speed of screening phages for high persistence. The importance of high persistence-screening is illustrated by our finding here of persistence dramatically higher for coliphage T3 than for its relative, coliphage T7, in murine blood. Coliphage T4 is more persistent, long-term than T3. Pseudomonas chlororaphis phage 201phi2-1 has relatively low persistence. These data are obtained with phages co-inoculated and separately assayed. In addition, highly persistent phage T3 undergoes dispersal to several murine organs and displays tumor tropism in epithelial tissue (xenografted human oral squamous cell carcinoma).

Herein, we report our institutional experience with a Telemonitoring and Care Program (TC-Program) to monitor and support left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients during COVID-19 outbreak. This single-arm cohort study analyzed 156 patients who entered the TC-Program at our institution between April and August 2020. The TC-Program was based on routine phone calls to patients and a 24/7 emergency line. In November 2020, patients were asked for feedback on the TC-Program and checked for survival, transplant, or explant. The primary endpoint was the rate of TC-Program-driven interventions. Patients (males: 82.8%) were 61 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 53.0-67.5) and on LVAD support for 1,266 days (IQR: 475-2,211). Patients were included in the TC-Program for a median time of 99 days (min:15, max:120) and received a median number of six phone calls (min:1, max:14). Twenty-three patients (14.7%) were referred for clinical evaluation after phone contact. Two patients (1.27%) were diagnosed with COVID-19: one of them died after intensive care, and one remained paucisymptomatic and recovered. Three patients asked to exit the program considering it not useful while the others gave high rates in terms of usefulness (median: 9, IQR: 8-10), information (median: 9, IQR: 8-10), good medical care (median: 9, IQR: 8-10), and psychologic support (median: 8, IQR: 7-10). A TC-Program based on the four ICSA principles (Inform, Care, Support, and Adapt) is feasible in LVAD patients and can be rapidly implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Telemonitoring and Care Program for Left Ventricular Assist Device Patients During COVID-19 Outbreak: A European Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forces many robotics teachers to rethink their approach to education. Distance rules and the constant threat of a partial or complete lockdown leading to limited access to classroom equipment make it challenging to plan for hands-on education where students experience robotics by experimenting and studying with robotic hardware. On the other hand, this hands-on active learning experience is one of the strengths of robotics education and the ability to handle hardware equipment a substantial learning goal of study programs on robotics. In this paper we present and discuss the approach taken for the course Robotics and Embedded Systems at Maastricht University. The course had been adjusted to meet COVID-19 safety regulations and to allow for a fast seamless transition between onsite education at university and online education where students can work with robotic hardware at home. We share experience, best practice advice as well as educational material to help other teachers benefit from our developments.

Existing standardised health classifications do not capture important dimensions of public health, which include its functions, the methods and interventions used to achieve these, the health issues and determinants of health that public health activities address, the resources and infrastructure they use, and the settings in which they occur. A classification that describes these dimensions will promote consistency in collecting and reporting information about public health programs, expenditure, workforce and performance. This paper describes the development of an initial version of such a classification. METHODS: We used open-source Protg software and published procedures to construct an ontology of public health, which forms the basis of the classification. We reviewed existing definitions of public health, descriptions of public health functions and classifications to develop the scope, domain, and multidimensional class structure of the ontology. These were then refined through a series of consultations with public health experts from across Australia, culminating in an initial classification framework. RESULTS: The public health classification consists of six top-level classes: public health 'Functions'; 'Health Issues'; 'Determinants of Health'; 'Settings'; 'Methods' of intervention; and 'Resources and Infrastructure'. Existing classifications (such as the international classifications of diseases, disability and functioning and external causes of injuries) can be used to further classify large parts of the classes 'Health Issues', 'Settings' and 'Resources and Infrastructure', while new subclass structures are proposed for the classes of public health 'Functions', 'Determinants of Health' and 'Interventions'. CONCLUSION: The public health classification captures the important dimensions of public health activity. It will facilitate the organisation of information so that it can be used to address questions relating to any of these dimensions, either singly or in combination. The authors encourage readers to use the classification, and to suggest improvements.","output":"A multidimensional classification of public health activity in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The progression of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is less well-studied in asymptomatic patients. The study aimed to understand the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at the time of admission and follow-up their occurrence of symptoms during hospitalization. Methods: : Patients were divided into two groupsthose with no symptoms until discharge (group A) and those who had symptoms that developed during hospitalization (group B). Baseline and clinical characteristics were retrospectively measured, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for deterioration during hospital stay. Results: : Overall, 223 patients were enrolled in the study, including 42 and 181 patients in groups A and B, respectively. Patients were older in group B than in group A. They developed cough as the most common symptom. Abnormal initial chest X-ray (CXR) and higher levels of C-reactive protein were frequently observed in group B than in group A. Moreover, 5 patients required mechanical support, including hi-flow nasal cannular and mechanical ventilation in group B. Five patients were transferred to tertiary hospitals owing to deterioration, and 4 patients succumbed to COVID-19. The risk factors for deterioration were age over 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and C-reactive protein > 1.

It contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides known as mogrosides. The extract from monk fruit is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose. In spite of its immense importance and International demand, Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) is not commercially cultivated outside China since scientific information for cultivation of this species is lacking. Planting material of monk fruit plant was not available in India. Thus, the seeds of monk fruit were introduced in India from China after following International norms. Then the experiments were conducted on different aspects such as seed germination, morphological and anatomical characterization, phenology, flowering and pollination behaviors, and dynamic of mogroside-V accumulation in fruit. The hydropriming at 40 C for 24 h was found effective to reduce the germination time and to increase the germination rate (77.33%). The multicellular uniseriate trichomes were observed in both the leaf surfaces, however, higher trichomes density was observed in the ventral surface of males compared to females. The microscopic view revealed that the ovary was trilocular (ovary consists three chambers) having two ovules in each chamber or locule. Most of the fruits were globose or oblong type with 5-7 cm in length and 4-7 cm diameter. Mogroside-V content in fruit at 80 days after pollination was 0.69% on dry weight basis. The rate of increase of mogroside-V accumulation from 50 to 70 days was very slow, whereas a sharp increase was observed from 70 to 80 days. The higher receptivity of stigma was observed with fully open flowers. The floral diagram and formula have also been developed for both male and female flowers.

METHODS: CT volumes from 2,398 United States radiology practices participating in the ACR Dose Index Registry from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, were analyzed. Data were compared to projected CT volumes using 2019 normative data and analyzed with respect to time since government orders, population-normalized positive COVID-19 tests, and attributed deaths. Data were stratified by state population density, unemployment status, and race. RESULTS: There were 16,198,830 CT examinations (2,398 practices). Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs per day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 fewer CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378 of 1,142,247; quartile 1] versus 21% [1,894,152 of 9,140,689; quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331 of 2,071,251; quartile 1] versus 23% [1,753,521 of 7,496,443; quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856 of 71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 substantially reduced US CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment.

There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling pathways of host cells play critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells. Drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel integrative analysis approach to identify the related molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and repurposed drugs as potentially effective treatments for COVID-19, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. RESULTS: We identified activated signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through integrative analysis. Then, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super GOs were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly activated. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. In addition to many drugs being evaluated in clinical trials, the dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: The integrative genomics data analysis and results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Computational analysis to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 based on transcriptional response of host cells to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate diagnostic tests that provide results in a timely manner are essential for the clinical and public health management of COVID-19 disease The choice as to which test to use will depend on the clinical presentation and the stage of the illness Nucleic acid tests, using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, are the most appropriate for diagnosing acute infection Combined deep nasal (or nasopharyngeal) and throat swabs are the preferred sample Serology can be used to diagnose previous infection, more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms Antigen tests are in development and their role is not yet defined Interpretation of results must take into account the pre-test probability of the patient having the disease This is based on their clinical presentation and epidemiological risk","output":"Testing for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Due to the Covid-19 social distancing restrictions, in March 2020, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar decided to replace students' clinical instruction with novel online electives.

Objective: To assess a new curriculum implementation at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. Materials and Methods: This for-credit, 2-week elective included 6 synchronous Zoom sessions where complex clinicopathological cases were discussed in small groups. We used open access digital microscopy slides from the University of Leeds' Virtual Pathology Library (http://www.virtualpathology.leeds.ac.uk/slides/library/). Students independently prepared for these sessions by reviewing cases, slides, readings, and questions in advance (asynchronous self-directed learning anchored on a flipped classroom model), and wrote a final review of a case. An assessment and feedback were given to each student. Results: Four elective iterations were offered to a total of 29 students, with learners and faculty spread over 4 countries. During the Zoom sessions, students controlled the digital slides and offered their own diagnoses, followed by group discussions to strengthen autonomy and confidence. We surveyed learners about the elective's performance (program evaluation). Students conveyed high levels of satisfaction about the elective's overall quality, their pathology learning and online interactions, with minimal challenges related to the remote nature of the course.

The Danish COVID-19 IBD Database is an extensive populationbased database which prospectively monitors the disease course of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 necessitating intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death, while adverse COVID- 19 was defined as requirement of COVID-19 related hospitalization. Regression analysis was adjusted for age, sex, disease type, disease activity, cardiovascular disease, and corticosteroids. Outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD were compared with those among the background population covering all incidents of COVID-19 in Denmark. Results: The study included 319 patients with UC and 197 patients with CD from January 28th, 2020, to April 1st, 2021. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. A significantly higher risk of COVID- 19-related hospitalization was observed among patients with UC (N=46(14.4%), RR=2.49 (95%CI 1.91-3.26)) and CD (N=24(12.2%), RR=2.11 (95%CI 1.45-3.07)) as compared with the background population (N=13,306 (5.8%)).

The chi-square test, T-test, and one-way analysis of variance were used to analyse data. RESULTS: Among 29 candidate SNPs, we found that CYP3A4 (rs3735451) was significantly associated with blood levels of HCQ and its metabolites in both the unadjusted model and adjusted model (patients taking HCQ for > 10 years) (P < 0.05). For CYP3A5 (rs776746), a greater risk of skin and mucous membrane ADRs was associated with the TT genotype than with the CT + CC genotypes (P = 0.033). For CYP2C8 (rs1058932), the AG genotype carried a greater risk of abnormal renal function than the AA + GG genotype (P = 0.017); for rs10882526, the GG genotype carried a greater risk of ophthalmic ADRs than the AA + AG genotypes (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: The CYP2C8 (rs1058932 and rs10882526) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) polymorphisms are likely involved in the ADRs of HCQ. Gene polymorphism analysis of CYP450 and therapeutic drug monitoring of HCQ and its metabolites might be useful to optimise HCQ administration and predict ADRs.","output":"Relationship of cytochrome P450 gene polymorphisms with blood concentrations of hydroxychloroquine and its metabolites and adverse drug reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The great success achieved by the two highly-effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the great potential of mRNA technology. Through the evolution of mRNA technology, chemistry has played an important role from mRNA modification to the synthesis of mRNA delivery platforms, which allows various applications of mRNA to be achieved both in vitro and in vivo. In this tutorial review, we provide a summary and discussion on the significant progress of emerging mRNA technologies, as well as the underlying chemical designs and principles. Various nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery strategies including protein-mRNA complex, lipid-based carriers, polymer-based carriers, and hybrid carriers for the efficient delivery of mRNA molecules are presented. Furthermore, typical mRNA delivery platforms for various biomedical applications (e.g., functional protein expression, vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and genome editing) are highlighted. Finally, our insights into the challenges and future development towards clinical translation of these mRNA technologies are provided.","output":"Emerging mRNA technologies: delivery strategies and biomedical applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) is an important host restriction factor, which poxviruses must overcome to productively infect host cells. To inhibit PKR, many poxviruses encode a pseudosubstrate mimic of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), designated K3 in vaccinia virus. Although the interaction between PKR and eIF2 is highly conserved, some K3 orthologs from host-restricted poxviruses were previously shown to inhibit PKR in a species-specific manner. To better define this host range function, we compared the sensitivity of PKR from 17 mammals to inhibition by K3 orthologs from closely related orthopoxviruses, a genus with a generally broader host range. The K3 orthologs showed species-specific inhibition of PKR and exhibited three distinct inhibition profiles. In some cases, PKR from closely related species showed dramatic differences in their sensitivity to K3 orthologs. Vaccinia virus expressing the camelpox virus K3 ortholog replicated more than three orders of magnitude better in human and sheep cells than a virus expressing vaccinia virus K3, but both viruses replicated comparably well in cow cells. Strikingly, in site-directed mutagenesis experiments between the variola virus and camelpox virus K3 orthologs, we found that different amino acid combinations were necessary to mediate improved or diminished inhibition of PKR derived from different host species. Because there is likely a limited number of possible variations in PKR that affect K3-interactions but still maintain PKR/eIF2 interactions, it is possible that by chance PKR from some potential new hosts may be susceptible to K3-mediated inhibition from a virus it has never previously encountered. We conclude that neither the sensitivity of host proteins to virus inhibition nor the effectiveness of viral immune antagonists can be inferred from their phylogenetic relatedness but must be experimentally determined.","output":"Orthopoxvirus K3 orthologs show virus- and host-specific inhibition of the antiviral protein kinase PKR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern in 2016, and it is still identified as a priority disease. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, a risk of neurologic complications is associated with infection in adults. Additionally, infection during pregnancy is directly linked to microcephaly and other congenital malformations. Since there are no currently available vaccines or approved therapeutics for this virus, there is a critical unmet need in developing treatments to prevent future ZIKV outbreaks. Towards this end, we performed a large-scale cell-based high-content screen of 51,520 chemical compounds to identify potential antiviral drug candidates. The compound (2E)-N-benzyl-3-(4-butoxyphenyl)prop-2-enamide (SBI-0090799) was found to inhibit replication of multiple ZIKV strains and in different cell systems. SBI-0090799 did not affect viral entry or RNA translation but suppressed RNA replication by preventing the formation of the membranous replication compartment. Selection of drug-resistant viruses identified single amino acid substitions in the N-terminal region of non-structural protein NS4A arguing this to be the likely drug target. These resistance mutations rescued viral RNA replication and restored the formation of the membranous replication compartment. This mechanism of action is similar to clinically-approved NS5A inhibitors for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Taken together, SBI-0090799 represents a promising lead candidate for the development of an antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection for the mitigation of severe complications and potential resurgent outbreaks of the virus. IMPORTANCE This study describes the elucidation of (2E)-N-benzyl-3-(4-butoxyphenyl)prop-2-enamide (SBI-0090799) as selective and potent inhibitor of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication using a high throughput screening approach. Mapping and resistance studies, supported by electron microscopy observations, indicate that the small molecule is functioning through inhibition of NS4A-mediated formation of ZIKV replication compartments in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intriguingly, this defines a novel non-enzymatic target and chemical matter for the development of a new class of ZIKV antivirals. Moreover, chemical modulation affecting this non-structural protein mirrors the identification and development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir and its derivatives, similarly interfering with the formation of the viral replication compartment and also targeting a protein with no enzymatic activity, which have been part of a curative strategy for HCV.","output":"The compound SBI-0090799 inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) infection by blocking de novo formation of the membranous replication compartment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B cells play vital roles in host defense against Pneumocystis infection.

A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. METHODS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and consistency rate. RESULTS: The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 4th day after symptom onset. In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%.

To date at least six different inflammasome signalling platforms have been reported (Bauernfeind & Hornung, EMBO Mol Med. 2013;5:814-26; Broz & Dixit, Nat Rev Immunol. 2016;16:407). This review focuses on the complex molecular machinery involved in activation and regulation of the best characterised inflammasome, NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), and the development of molecular agents to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome function. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces inflammation via secretion of interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) proinflammatory cytokines, with orchestration of pyroptotic cell death, to eliminate invading microbial pathogens. This field has gradually moved from an emphasis on monogenic autoinflammatory conditions, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), to the broad spectrum of innate immune-mediated disease. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is also linked to a range of common disorders in humans including type 2 diabetes (Krainer et al., J Autoimmun. 2020:102421), cystic fibrosis (Scambler et al., eLife. 2019;8), myocardial infarction, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (Savic et al., Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2020:1-16) and cancers such as mesotheliomas and gliomas (Moossavi et al., Mol Cancer. 2018;17:158). We describe how laboratory-based assessment of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is emerging as an integral part of the clinical evaluation and treatment of a range of undifferentiated systemic autoinflammatory disorders (uSAID) (Harrison et al., JCI Insight. 2016;1), where a DNA-based diagnosis has not been possible. In addition, this review summarises the current literature on physiological inhibitors and features various pharmacological approaches that are currently being developed, with potential for clinical translation in autoinflammatory and immune-mediated conditions.

Delineating stoke infarct core in medical images plays a critical role in optimal stroke treatment selection. However, accurate estimation of infarct core still remains challenging because of 1) the large shape and location variation of infarct cores; 2) the complex relationships between perfusion parameters and final tissue outcome. METHODS We develop an encoder-decoder based semantic model, i.e., Ischemic Stroke Prediction Network (ISP-Net), to predict infarct core after thrombolysis treatment on CT perfusion (CTP) maps. Features of native CTP, CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow), CBV (Cerebral Blood Volume), MTT (Mean Transit Time), Tmax are generated and fused with five-path convolutions for comprehensive analysis. A multi-scale atrous convolution (MSAC) block is firstly put forward as the enriched high-level feature extractor in ISP-Net to improve prediction accuracy. A retrospective dataset which is collected from multiple stroke centers is used to evaluate the performance of ISP-Net. The gold standard infarct cores are delineated on the follow-up scans, i.e., non-contrast CT (NCCT) or MRI diffusion-weighted image (DWI). RESULTS In clinical dataset cross-validation, we achieve mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.801, precision of 81.3%, sensitivity of 79.5%, specificity of 99.5%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.721. Our approach yields better outcomes than several advanced deep learning methods, i.e., Deeplab V3, U-Net++, CE-Net, X-Net and Non-local U-Net, demonstrating the promising performance in infarct core prediction. No significant difference of the prediction error is shown for the patients with follow-up NCCT and follow-up DWI (P >0.05). CONCLUSION This study provides an approach for fast and accurate stroke infarct core estimation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic concerns were raised that FNE had the potential of generating aerosols resulting in human cross-contamination when performed on SARS-COV2 carriers. In the UK, and other European countries, national guidelines were issued restricting FNE to essential cases. We surveyed ENT-UK members and Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) members to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (first peak) on FNE practice in the UK. METHODS: An observational internet-based survey constructed in accordance to the CHERRIES checklist and setup in SurveyMonkey of FNE practice amongst UK-based ENT surgeons and speech and language therapists in community clinics, the outpatient department, inpatient wards, ICU, emergency department and operating theatres (through the NHS and private sector) prior to, during and following the first COVID-19 wave in the UK. RESULTS: 314 responses collected (24% response rate), 82% from ENT clinicians, 17% from SLTs and 1% from other allied healthcare professionals. Overall, there has been a large reduction in the volume and indications for FNE during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with limited recovery by mid-August 2020. Cancer and airway assessments were impacted less. A wide range of FNE protocols influenced by local factors are reported, varying in endoscope preference, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and sterilization methods. Where dedicated Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) rooms were unavailable, clinicians resorted to window opening and variable room down-time between patients. Endoscope preference reflected availability and user familiarity, ENT trainees favoring the use of single-use video endoscopes. CONCLUSION: Despite national guidance, local practice of FNE remains interrupted and highly variable in the UK. A collaborative inter-disciplinary approach is required to re-introduce FNE safely in volume across healthcare settings, re-establishing timely endoscopic diagnosis and pre-pandemic levels of patient care.","output":"COVID-VU C ENT-UK national survey of flexible nasendoscopy in the upper aerodigestive tract amidst the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anesthesiologists have been at the forefront of COVID-19 pandemic and are particularly at risk of suffering both physical and emotional effects There have been several individual and organizational strategies that can be put in place to tackle their well-being Self-strategies that are recommended are adequate rest and sleep, consistent work breaks, help seeking behavior, emotional control and acceptance of limitations of their own competence and healthcare systems Several online training programs are available for individual guidance Organizations can also support their staff in different ways It is important to recognize those who are more vulnerable physically and emotionally Institution should implement stress reduction strategies, provide adequate PPE, should be able to communicate with their employees in a clear and honest manner and enforce infection control policies In addition, institutions must take other physical measures where resources permit, like provision of negative pressure rooms and to provide updated and accurate information Both personal and psychological support is needed Several different models have been suggested for emotional support One particularly vulnerable group that requires additional assistance are those in quarantine Last but not least, in addition to the implementation of all these measures it is imperative to sustain these activities","output":"Anesthesiologists' occupational wellbeing and support during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has quickly turned into a global health problem.

Biochemical inflammatory markers as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined. RESULTS: TT and cFT were significantly and positively associated with PCT, CRP, and fibrinogen as well as with a worse hospital course. We did not observe any significant association between TT and cFT with LH; conversely, both TT and cFT showed a positive correlation with cortisol. By LOWESS analysis, a linear relationship could be assumed for CRP and fibrinogen, while a threshold effect was apparent in the relationship between TT and procalcitonin, LDH and ferritin. When the TT threshold value of 1 nmol/L was used, significant associations between TT and PCT, LDH or ferritin were observed for values above this value. For LDH and ferritin, this was confirmed also in an age-adjusted model. Similar results were found for the association of cFT with the inflammatory markers with a threshold effect towards LDH and ferritin with increased LDH and ferritin levels for values above cFT 5 pmol/L. Cortisol is associated with serum inflammatory markers with similar trends observed for TT; conversely, the relationship between LH and inflammatory markers had different trends.

The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested.

This study provides various intelligent deep learning (DL)-based methods for automated SZ diagnosis via electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The obtained results are compared with those of conventional intelligent methods. To implement the proposed methods, the dataset of the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland, has been used. First, EEG signals were divided into 25 s time frames and then were normalized by z-score or norm L2. In the classification step, two different approaches were considered for SZ diagnosis via EEG signals. In this step, the classification of EEG signals was first carried out by conventional machine learning methods, e.g., support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, na?ve Bayes, random forest, extremely randomized trees, and bagging. Various proposed DL models, namely, long short-term memories (LSTMs), one-dimensional convolutional networks (1D-CNNs), and 1D-CNN-LSTMs, were used in the following. In this step, the DL models were implemented and compared with different activation functions. Among the proposed DL models, the CNN-LSTM architecture has had the best performance. In this architecture, the ReLU activation function with the z-score and L2-combined normalization was used. The proposed CNN-LSTM model has achieved an accuracy percentage of 99.25%, better than the results of most former studies in this field.

The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted this engagement in two ways. First, social distancing measures forbid most face-to-face participatory activities originally envisioned in projects. Second, the restrictions have caused hardships for the stakeholders being engaged by these projects. We assessed the impact of Covid-19 on stakeholder engagement activities in ongoing EU marine science projects by posing the following questions: What problems has Covid-19 caused for the workflow and outcomes of current research projects, (ii) how have scientists responsible for stakeholder engagement coped with the situation, and (iii) if alternative stakeholder activities were implemented, how have these been evaluated? Our survey was conducted nearly 2 months after the onset of Covid-19 lockdowns. It addressed researchers who engage with stakeholders in EU projects and delivers insights into the practical implications of Covid-19 for stakeholder engagement and the measures taken to tackle this challenge.

DISCUSSION The ability of our current healthcare system to cope with the current situation is mainly dependent on advanced health technology, such as telehealth, chatbots, virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI). Telehealth can be a novel tool for improving our current healthcare system and allowing for greater delivery of healthcare services during global crises (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). Technology, such as chatbots, VR, and AI, could be utilized to reduce the burden of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, as well as to build a patient-centered decision-making healthcare system. OBJECTIVES Understanding the various methods of enhancing healthcare services using advanced health technology will help to develop new applications that can be integrated into regular healthcare and in time of healthcare crises.

Test calves received 1 of 8 possible doses (25, 50, 100, 500, 1  10(3), 1  10(4), 1  10(5), and 1  10(6) oocysts). All 27 test calves developed diarrhea. Fecal oocyst shedding occurred in 25 (92.6%) test calves and in 0 control calves. The 2 non-shedding test calves both received 25 oocysts. There was an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of fecal oocyst shedding (P = 0.005). There was no relationship found between dose and duration (P = 0.2) or cessation (P = 0.3) of fecal oocyst shedding. In addition, there was not a significant relationship between log-dose and the log-peak oocysts (P = 0.2) or log-total oocysts (P = 0.5) counted/g of feces across the dose groups. There was a positive doseCresponse relationship between log-dose and diarrhea (P = 0.01). However, when controlling for other factors, such as onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding, dose was not a significant predictor of diarrhea (P = 0.5). Onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be the best predictors of diarrhea (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.04, respectively). The ID(50) for fecal oocyst shedding was 5.8 oocysts, for diarrhea was 9.7 oocysts, and for fecal oocyst shedding with diarrhea was 16.6 oocysts.

This work presents an investigation of the deflection and structural stability of nanohole array-based optofluidic sensors operating in flow-through mode. The analysis was approached using experiments, simulations via finite element method, and established theoretical models. The results depict that certain areas of the sensor deflect under pressure, with some regions suffering high mechanical stress. The offset in the deflection values between theoretical models and actual experimental values is overturned when only the effective area of the substrate, of 450 m, is considered.

In addition, the focal Tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation result on COVID-19.

MAIN METHODS Telmisartan was administered orally with a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, 1 h prior to 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 14 days. KEY FINDINGS 3-NP-injected animals which were treated with telmisartan showed marked improvement in muscle strength and motor functions evaluated by rotarod, grip strength, and open field tests. Moreover, administration of telmisartan attenuated 3-NP-induced oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and apoptosis with prominent decline in malondialdehyde striatal content in addition to NADPH oxidase reduced expression contrary to noticeable increment in reduced glutathione content. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory markers; tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, prostaglandin E2, and cyclooxygenase-2 contents were significantly reduced along with decreased active caspase-3 immunoreactivity. Telmisartan was also implicated in the modulation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (PI3K/Akt/GSK-3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 cascades with consequent anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. Photomicrographs of telmisartan-treated animals confirmed its neuroprotective effects showing dismounted neuronal death and obvious increase in neuronal survival. These beneficial effects could be attributed to telmisartan's ability to induce peroxisome proliferator activated receptor- expression as well as its well-known blocking effect of angiotensin-II receptors type 1.

It is being investigated as a treatment for a growing number of diseases including hepatic encephalopathy and eradication of antimicrobial resistant organisms, and the list of indications will likely expand in the future. There is no universally accepted definition of what FMT is, and its mechanism of action remains incompletely understood; this has likely contributed to the breadth of approaches to regulation depending on interpretation. In the UK FMT is considered a medicinal product, in North America, a biological product, whereas in parts of Europe, it is considered a human cell/ tissue product. Regulation seeks to improve quality and safety, however, lack of standardisation creates confusion, and overly restrictive regulation may hamper widespread access and discourage research using FMT. FMT is generally considered safe, especially if rigorous donor screening and testing is conducted. Most short-term risks are associated with the delivery method (e.g. colonoscopy). Longer term risks are less well described but longitudinal follow-up of treated cohorts is in place to assess for this, and no signal towards harm has been found to date. Rarely it has been associated with adverse outcomes including the transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and even death.

Results After full text review, 282 studies were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in Africa (43%), followed by North America (23%), Asia (15%) and Europe (12%). Descriptive analysis and text mining analysis showed MI in MH has been conceptualised by focusing on two main aspects: psychosocial support and instrumental support for maternal health care utilisation. Differences in measurement and topics were noted according to continent with Africa focusing on HIV prevention, North America and Europe on psychosocial health and stress, and Asia on nutrition. One third of studies used one single indicator for assessing MI in MH and no common pattern of indicators could be identified. Antenatal care attendance was the most used indicator (40%) followed by financial support (17%), presence during childbirth (17%) and HIV testing (14%). Majority of studies did not collect data from men directly. Discussion Researchers often focus on a single aspect of MI in MH, resulting in the usage of a narrow and simplified set of indicators. Aspects such as communication between the couple, shared decision making, participation in household tasks and the subjective feeling of being supported have received little attention. We believe a more multidimensional approach can broaden the potential of MI programs.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study of adult patients listed for heart transplant used the United Network for Organ Sharing database from January 2006 to June 2020. Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI) (18.5C24.9, 25C29.9, 30C34.9, 35C39.9, and 40C55 kg/m(2)). Recipient characteristics and donor characteristics were analyzed. Outcomes analyzed included transplantation, waitlist death, and posttransplant death. BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2) was used as the reference compared with progressive BMI categories. There were 46 645 patients listed for transplantation. Patients in higher BMI categories were less likely to be transplanted. The lowest likelihood of transplantation was in the highest BMI category, 40 to 55 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19 [0.05C0.76]; P=0.02). Patients within the 2 highest BMI categories had higher risk of posttransplantation death (HR, 1.29; P<0.001 and HR, 1.65; P<0.001, respectively).

The lethal pathology associated with FIP (granulomatous inflammation and T-cell lymphopenia) is thought to be mediated by aberrant modulation of the immune system due to infection of cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs in cats with FIP, and has been suggested to play a significant role in the disease process. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. Here we show that infection of primary blood-derived feline mononuclear cells by FIPV WSU 79-1146 and FIPV-DF2 leads to rapid activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and that this activation regulates production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). FIPV-induced p38 MAPK activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was inhibited by the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors SB 203580 and SC 409 in a dose-dependent manner.

Nevertheless, the substantial basis and molecular mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA remain elusive. Methods: Herein, an integrated approach, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment validation, was utilized to reveal the new candidate active component and mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA. Results: The results show that kaempferol is the most significant bioactive component of CSMFCH on OA. The mechanism and targets of CSMFCH against OA are relevant to hormone regulation, oxidant stress, and reproductive promotion. In order to validate network pharmacology results, molecular docking and experiment validation were conducted. In detail, molecular docking was employed to verify the strong binding interactions between kaempferol and the core targets. UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS was used to identify kaempferol in the CSMFCH extract. In vitro and in vivo experiments further proved CSMFCH and kaempferol could enhance the mouse Leydig (TM3) and mouse Sertoli (TM4) cell viability, improve the male reproductive organ weights, sperm quality, and decrease testis tissue damage in the OA mouse model induced by CP.

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24 0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12 0.02 vs. 0.25 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries.

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. RESULTS: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5C17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6C98.9%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection.

OBJECTIVE: To accurately reflect the pre-existing diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with Sars-CoV-2 infection through autopsy. DESIGN: Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple choice and openended survey responses. RESULTS: Patients dying of or with COVID-19 had an average of 8.89 pathologic conditions documented at autopsy, spanning a combination of prior chronic disease and acute conditions acquired during hospitalization. Virtually all decedents were cited as having more than one preexisting condition, encompassing an average of 2.88 such diseases each.

The Nepalese government announced a nationwide lockdown beginning on March 24, 2020 as an attempt to restrain the spread of COVID-19. The prohibition in flight operations and movement of vehicles, factory shutdowns and restriction in people's movement due to the lockdown led to a significant reduction in the amounts of pollutants degrading air quality in many countries. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to analyze changes in particulate matter (PM) emissions and the air quality index (AQI) of six cities in Nepal i.e., Damak, Simara, Kathmandu, Pokhara, Nepalgunj and Surkhet due to the nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS. Daily PM concentrations of each of the six study cities from January 24 to September 21, 2020 were obtained from the World Air Quality Index project (https://aqicn.org) and analyzed using R Studio software. The drop percentage was calculated to determine the change in PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentration during different time periods. Independent sample MannCWhitney U tests were performed to test the significance of differences in mean concentration for each site during the lockdown period (24 MarchC24 July 2020) and its corresponding period in 2019. Similarly, the significance of differences in mean concentrations between the lockdown period and the period immediately before lockdown (23 JanuaryC23 March) was also examined using the same test. RESULTS. During the lockdown period, in overall Nepal, AQI(PM2.5) and AQI(PM10) were within the moderate zone for the maximum number of days. As a result of the lockdown, the highest immediate and final drop of PM(2.5) was observed in Damak (26.37%) and Nepalgunj (80.86%), respectively. Similarly, the highest immediate drop of PM(10) was observed in Surkhet (37.22%) and finally in Nepalgunj (81.14%). Analysis with the MannCWhitney U test indicated that for both PM types, all sites showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in mean concentrations during lockdown and the corresponding period in 2019.

To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary -actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNACmacromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3 gene amplicons compared with the 5. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary -actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous -actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001).

Our main findings are as follows. First, the declaration of the state of emergency reduced the number of people leaving their homes by 8.5% through the first channel, which is of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for lockdowns in the United States. Second, a 1% increase in new infections in a prefecture reduces people's outings in that prefecture by 0.027%. Third, the government's requests are responsible for about one quarter of the decrease in outings in Tokyo, while the remaining three quarters are the result of citizens obtaining new information through government announcements and the daily release of the number of infections.

Oral status was examined regarding the occurrence of carious lesions using decay missing filling teeth (DMFT), gingivitis as bleeding on probing (BOP), and bacterial colonization as plaque control record (PCR). (3) Results: The strongest correlation was revealed between BMI and concentration of uric acid, cystatin C, GFR estimated by the Filler formula (r = 0.74; r = 0.48; r = ?0.52), and between oral variables such as PCR and BOP (r = 0.54; r = 0.58).

(4) Conclusions: No specific relation to markers of kidney disease were found; however, more frequent gingivitis/bacterial colonization and significant differences in oral status between obese and non-obese patients were revealed. Susceptibility to inflammation may be conducive to developing metabolic syndrome and kidney damage in the form of obesity-related glomerulopathy and contribute to future dental caries.

Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics.

However, creating a custom-fit computer-aided design (CAD) model for each mask is currently a manual process and thereby not scalable for a pandemic crisis. This paper aims to develop a novel design process to reduce overall design cost and time, thus enabling the mass customisation of 3D printed respirator masks. Design/methodology/approach: Four data acquisition methods were used to collect 3D facial data from five volunteers. Geometric accuracy, equipment cost and acquisition time of each method were evaluated to identify the most suitable acquisition method for a pandemic crisis. Subsequently, a novel three-step design process was developed and scripted to generate respirator mask CAD models for each volunteer. Computational time was evaluated and geometric accuracy of the masks was evaluated via one-sided Hausdorff distance. Findings: Respirator masks were successfully generated from all meshes, taking &lt;2 min/mask for meshes of 50,000100,000 vertices and &lt;4 min for meshes of 500,000 vertices. The average geometric accuracy of the mask ranged from 0.3 mm to 1.35 mm, depending on the acquisition method. The average geometric accuracy of mesh obtained from different acquisition methods ranged from 0.56 mm to 1.35 mm. A smartphone with a depth sensor was found to be the most appropriate acquisition method. Originality/value: A novel and scalable mass customisation design process was presented, which can automatically generate CAD models of custom-fit respirator masks in a few minutes from a raw 3D facial mesh. Four acquisition methods, including the use of a statistical shape model, a smartphone with a depth sensor, a light stage and a structured light scanner were compared;one method was recommended for use in a pandemic crisis considering equipment cost, acquisition time and geometric accuracy. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A scalable mass customisation design process for 3D-printed respirator mask to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First detected in Wuhan, China, the novel 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus responsible for an unprecedented, worldwide pandemic caused by COVID-19.

In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NP(NTD) detection sensitivity.

The ancient Indian traditional medicine has been of great interest of Virologists worldwide to decipher potential antivirals. Hence, in this study, phytochemicals (1,952 compounds) from eight potential medicinal plants used in Indian traditional medicine were meticulously collated, based on their usage in respiratory disorders, along with immunomodulatory and anti-viral potential from contemporary literature. Further, these compounds were virtually screened against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein. The potential compounds from each plant were prioritized based on the binding affinity, key hotspot interactions at ACE2 binding region and glycosylation sites. Finally, the potential hits in complex with spike protein were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation (450 ns), to infer the stability of complex formation. Among the compounds screened, Tellimagrandin-II (binding energy of ?8.2 kcal/mol and binding free energy of ?32.08 kcal/mol) from Syzygium aromaticum L. and O-Demethyl-demethoxy-curcumin (binding energy of ?8.0 kcal/mol and binding free energy of ?12.48 kcal/mol) from Curcuma longa L. were found to be highly potential due to their higher binding affinity and significant binding free energy (MM-PBSA), along with favorable ADMET properties and stable intermolecular interactions with hotspots (including the ASN343 glycosylation site).

Neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through interaction with Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (S-RBD) can block the virus from entering and infecting host cells. However, there is a lack of information about the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may be associated with protective responses. For these reasons, to counteract viral infection, the conventional virus neutralization test (VNT) is still considered the gold standard. The aim of this study was to contribute more and detailed information about sVNTs' performance, by determining in vitro the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody concentration using four different commercial assays and then comparing the obtained data to VNT. METHODS: Eighty-eight samples were tested using two chemiluminescence assays (Snibe and Mindray) and two ELISA assays (Euroimmun and Diesse). The antibody titers were subsequently detected and quantified by VNT. RESULTS: The overall agreement between each sVNT and VNT was 95.45% for Euroimmun and 98.86% for Diesse, Mindray and Snibe. Additionally, we investigated whether the sVNTs were closer to the gold standard than traditional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays S-RBD or S1 based, finding a higher agreement mean value for sVNTs (98.01  1.705% vs 95.45  1.921%; p < 0.05).

METHODS From October 2000 to December 2006, radical surgery was planned in 211 patients who presented early-stage cancer of the cervix. Both ISB and Tc99 were used to detect the SLNs. In all cases, we proceeded with laparoscopy for the identification and removal of the SLNs, followed by a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic node sampling. The SLNs were sent for frozen section (1 level) and were ultra-staged (6 levels) for final pathology. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS Among the 211 patients, ISB (n=152) identified at least 1 SLN in 92.8% of the cases. With Tc99 (n=166), the detection rate of SLN increased to 96.9%. When both techniques were used together (n=107), Tc99 was significantly better than ISB by 7.8% (p=0.0094) and at least 1 SLN (hot and/or blue) was found in 99.1% of the cases. In 16.7% of patients, a SLN was located in aberrant sites, including 3.8% in the para-aortic area. Thirty-three out of the 211 patients (15.6%) had lymph node metastases. When considering only the 181 patients with bilateral SLNs identified, the NPV of SLN is 100% after ultra staging on final pathology and 94.2% on frozen section (FS). CONCLUSION Sentinel node mapping is feasible using laparoscopy. The radio-isotopic technique adds significantly to the rate of detection. The main benefits of SLN mapping in cervical cancer are the detection of micro-metastases on ultra staging which might be missed on routine pathological evaluation, and identification of aberrant drainage sites. However, the current frozen section techniques lack sensitivity to identify very small metastases and need refinement. SLN mapping should become the standard of care in the modern management of cervical cancer and complete pelvic lymphadenectomy could be avoided when bilateral SLNs are detected in patients with lesions less than 2 cm.","output":"Value of sentinel node mapping in cancer of the cervix."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: At present, thyroid disorders have a great incidence in the worldwide population, so the development of alternative methods for improving the diagnosis process is necessary.

In this study, which is an important tourist city of Antalya, Turkey, and the world, coastal changes using historical and recent satellite data have been analyzed. The focus of the study is to analyze long-term coastal change with Landsat data and the data obtained every 5 years between 1985 and 2020 and to analyze short-term change with annual Sentinel-2 data between 2015 and 2020.

DESIGN Realist review following a sequence of five steps: (a) scoping search and identification of programme theory; (b) evidence searching; (c) critical appraisal and data extraction; (d) organisation of evidence and (e) refinement of programme theory. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Documents (including peer-reviewed articles, grey literature, websites, reports and conference papers) either full text, or a section of relevance to the overarching research question were included. DATA SOURCES EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, Psych Info, Google and Google Scholar were searched iteratively between May and August 2020. Search strategy was refined for each database providing a broad enough review for building of programme theory. ANALYSIS Data from eligible documents was extracted to build understanding of the factors that influence decision-making. Data were mapped to create a data matrix according to context (C), mechanism (M), outcome (O), configurations (C) (CMOCs) for the process of informed consent, to aid interpretation and produce final programme theory. RESULTS 566 documents were screened and 71 included. Final programme theory was underpinned by CMOCs on processes influencing decisions to take part in research. Key findings indicate the type of infrastructure required, for example, resources, services and policies, to support inclusion in health research, with a greater need to increase the social presence of researchers within communities, improve cultural competency of individuals and organisations, reduce the complexity of participant information, and provide additional resources to support adaptive processes and shared decision making. CONCLUSION The review indicates the need for a more inclusive research infrastructure that facilitates diverse participation in health research through incorporating adaptive processes that support shared decision making within the informed consent process and in the conduct of research projects.","output":"Factors influencing decisions about whether to participate in health research by people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds: a realist review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses, for which we may not have extensive data We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e g , codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses","output":"Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals features important for vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Istituto Superiore di Sanit (ISS) has been asked for rapid technical and scientific advice to the State and Regions during Sars-CoV-2 pandemic preparedness.

However, large-scale data about the association between vaccination, and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with ARD is limited. METHODS: We used data from Clalit Health Services, which covers more than half of the population in Israel. Patients with ARD older than 18 were included between 20 December 2021 and 30 September 2021, when the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and later a third booster dose, were available. The primary outcome was a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We used a Cox regression models with vaccination status as time-dependent covariate and calculated the HR for the study outcome. RESULTS: We included 127 928 patients with ARD, of whom, by the end of the study follow-up, there were 27 350 (21.3%) unvaccinated patients, 31 407 (24.5%) vaccinated patients and 69 171 (54.1%) patients who also received a third booster-dose. We identified 8470 (6.6%) patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test during the study period. The HR for SARS-CoV-2 infection among the vaccination group was 0.143 (0.095 to 0.214, p<0.001), and among the booster group was 0.017 (0.009 to 0.035, p<0.001). Similar results were found regardless of the type of ARD group or antirheumatic therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and the booster are associated with better COVID-19 outcomes in patients with ARD.","output":"BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and booster in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases: a national cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS To describe the epidemiology of paediatric type 1 diabetes over 50 years in Canterbury, New Zealand. Further, to explore variation in case presentation according to age, gender, ethnicity, urban /rural character, socio-economic deprivation and immunogenetic features. METHODS Prospective ascertainment of cases commenced in 1982, and incident cases presenting 1970 to 1982 were ascertained retrospectively from clinical records. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of type 1 diabetes by a physician and commencement of insulin therapy at diagnosis and age less than 15 years. Data collection included name, hospital number, date of birth, date of diagnosis, and date of initiation of insulin treatment. Full address at diagnosis was assigned an urban-rural classification, and a deprivation score. HLA-DQ susceptibility alleles and diabetes associated autoantibodies were determined. RESULTS The incidence of type 1 diabetes increased more than 5-fold (3.9% per annum) over 50 years for the entire cohort. The mean for 5-year periods, starting from 1970, increased from 5.3 to 29.0 cases per 100 000 person years. Incidence was greatest in the 10-14 year age group. The cohort is predominantly European (89.4%), but there has been an increase in cases identifying as New Zealand Mori in the last three decades.

The 2 most common COVID-19 vaccine platforms currently in use, messenger RNA (mRNA) and adenovirus vector, were developed on the basis of previous research in use of this technology. Postauthorization surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines has identified safety signals, including unusual cases of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis reported in recipients of adenoviral vector vaccines. One of the devastating manifestations of this syndrome, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). This review summarizes the current evidence and indications regarding biology, clinical characteristics, and pharmacological management of VITT with CVST. Observations: VITT appears to be similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with both disorders associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and presence of autoantibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Unlike VITT, HIT is triggered by recent exposure to heparin. Owing to similarities between these 2 conditions and lack of high-quality evidence, interim recommendations suggest avoiding heparin and heparin analogues in patients with VITT. Based on initial reports, female sex and age younger than 60 years were identified as possible risk factors for VITT. Treatment consists of therapeutic anticoagulation with nonheparin anticoagulants and prevention of formation of autoantibody-PF4 complexes, the latter being achieved by administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG). Steroids, which can theoretically inhibit the production of new antibodies, have been used in combination with IVIG. In severe cases, plasma exchange should be used for clearing autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and eculizumab, can be considered when other therapies fail. Routine platelet transfusions, aspirin, and warfarin should be avoided because of the possibility of worsening thrombosis and magnifying bleeding risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Adverse events like VITT, while uncommon, have been described despite vaccination remaining the most essential component in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. While it seems logical to consider the use of types of vaccines (eg, mRNA-based administration) in individuals at high risk, treatment should consist of therapeutic anticoagulation mostly with nonheparin products and IVIG.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Pharmacological Management of COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia With Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked hostility against Chinese immigrants and sojourners in the U.S. and other countries.

However, vaccine hesitancy (unwillingness for vaccination despite available vaccination services) threatens public health. Individuals taking immunosuppression for psoriasis have been prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination, however there is a paucity of information on vaccine hesitancy in this population, including contributing factors. While global healthcare has been severely disrupted in the pandemic, the impact on access to psoriasis care and whether this may negatively influence vaccine uptake, is underexplored. ObjectivesTo explore organisational and individual factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in individuals with psoriasis. MethodsIndividuals with psoriasis, identified through global patient organisations and social media, completed a cross-sectional self-reported online survey. The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between predictor variables (organisational and individual factors) and outcome. ResultsSelf-reported data from 802 individuals with psoriasis across 89 countries were available (65.6% female, median age 51 years [IQR 37-61], 43.7% taking systemic immunosuppression). Eight percent (n=63) reported vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting vaccine hesitancy were younger, more likely to be of non-white ethnicity, non-UK resident, have a lower BMI, not taking systemic immunosuppression and with shorter disease duration compared to those not reporting vaccine hesitancy. The commonest reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns regarding vaccine side-effects, that the vaccine is too new or that psoriasis may worsen post-vaccination. Forty percent (n=322) reported that their psoriasis care had been disrupted by the pandemic. These individuals were younger, of non-white ethnicity, with shorter duration and more severe psoriasis. Disruption to psoriasis care was associated with vaccine hesitancy (unadjusted OR 2.97 (95%CI 1.23-7.13), p=0.015), although not statistically significant in the adjusted model. ConclusionA minority of individuals with psoriasis from our study reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Similar to general population trends, vaccine hesitancy in our psoriasis sample is most common in younger age and ethnic minority groups. Our data highlight patient concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination, which are important to address during patient-clinician interactions to help optimise vaccine uptake and mitigate risks from the ongoing pandemic in individuals with psoriasis.

This paper proposes a mobile deep learning system that calculates UVI based on the illuminance values at the user's location obtained with mobile devices' help. The proposed method analyzed the correlation between illuminance and UVI based on the natural light DB collected through the actual measurements, and the deep learning model's data set was extracted. After the selection of the input variables to calculate the correct UVI, the deep learning model based on the TensorFlow set with the optimum number of layers and number of nodes was designed and implemented, and learning was executed via the data set.

This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on patient presentations with acute coronary syndromes during the first and second pandemic wave in Melbourne, Victoria. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of adults presenting with cute coronary syndrome during the first pandemic wave from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2020 and the second pandemic wave from 1 July 2020 to 31 August 2020 was compared to a control period from 1 March to 31 April 2019 at a single sub-tertiary referral centre in Melbourne, Victoria servicing a catchment area with a relatively high incidence of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Three-hundred-and-thirty-five (335) patients were hospitalised with acute coronary syndromes across all three time periods. The total number of patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome was reduced during the pandemic, with a higher proportion of ST elevation myocardial infarctions. Ischaemic times increased with time from symptom onset to first medical contact rising from 191 minutes in the control period to 292 minutes in the first wave (p=0.06) and 271 minutes in the second wave (p=0.06). Coronary angiography with subsequent revascularisation significantly increased from 55% in the control period undergoing revascularisation to 69% in the first wave (p<0.001) and 74% in the second wave (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A concerning reduction in acute coronary presentations occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, associated with longer ischaemic times and a higher proportion requiring revascularisation.

Our objective was to summarize actions, health policies and clinical guidelines adopted by six European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and United Kingdom) during the pandemic, and to assess the impact of national policies on reducing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in older populations. METHODS: Reports by geriatricians on the measures and actions undertaken by governmental institutions in each country between March and July 2020, as well as the role of primary care during the pandemic, covered three areas: (a) general health strategies related to the pandemic; (b) impact of COVID-19 on health inequity; and (c) initiatives and challenges for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. RESULTS: In the six countries, COVID-19 mortality in nursing homes ranged from 26 to 66%. Although all countries endorsed the World Health Organization general recommendations, the reports identified the lack of harmonized European guidelines and policies for nursing homes, with competencies transferred to national (or regional) governments. All countries restricted visits in nursing homes, but no specific action plans were provided. The role of primary care was limited by the centralization of the crisis in hospital settings.

The most important goals were to prevent the risk of infection in the professionals, in families and their newborns, as well as to ensure the same effectiveness for the early detection of the diseases included in our programme. To this end, the laboratory was reorganised by dividing the staff into groups and the spaces were redistributed. It was also necessary to modify several protocols and circuits, especially for the management of early discharges from maternity centres, and for the collection of the necessary second samples (from newborns with inconclusive results or for low quality samples). In general, a 36% reduction in the time of arrival of these second samples at the laboratory was achieved with respect to the previous circuit. In the specific case of cystic fibrosis detection, the implementation of a new strategy meant a 100% reduction in the request for second samples and a 70% reduction in the age of diagnosis of the newborn.

AIMS: To determine the effects of the surgical mask on respiratory gas exchange parameters, dyspnoea, and hemodynamic responses during maximal exercise in different age groups and gender. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy participants between 18 and 65 years (mean 37.35  15.99) performed a maximal exercise test twice randomly, with and without a mask. To determine the respiratory gas exchange parameters (peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)), minute ventilation (V(E)), energy expenditure (EE), respiratory rate), and hemodynamic responses, each participant underwent a maximal exercise test with Bruce protocol on the treadmill. The modified Borg scale (MBS) was used to determine the dyspnoea before and after exercise test. RESULTS: Test duration (min), metabolic equivalents (MET), VO2(peak) ml/kg/min, respiratory rate, and peak heart rate (HR(peak)) of young participants after exercise test with and without a mask were higher than in middle-aged participants (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between males and females in test duration, VO(2peak) ml/kg/min, VO(2peak) ml/min, MET, V(E) l/min, respiratory rate, MBS, and EE in masked tests (p > 0.05).

METHODS We examined trends in seizures of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl within five High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas-Washington/Baltimore, Chicago, Ohio, New Mexico, and North Florida. Trends were examined for number and total weight of seizures from March 2019 through September 2020 using Joinpoint regression. RESULTS Significant decreases in seizures involving marijuana ( = -0.03, P = 0.005) and methamphetamine ( = -0.02, P = 0.026) were detected through April 2020, and then seizures of marijuana ( = 0.10, P = 0.028) and methamphetamine ( = 0.11, P = 0.010) significantly increased through September 2020. The number of seizures involving marijuana and methamphetamine peaked in August 2020, exceeding the highest pre-COVID-19 number of seizures. Fentanyl seizures increased overall ( = 0.05, P < .001), but did not significantly drop during the start of COVID-19, and significant changes were not detected for cocaine or heroin. We also detected a significant increase in weight of marijuana seized from April through September 2020 ( = 0.40, P = .001).

Dental pulp, periodontal ligament, apical papilla, human exfoliated deciduous teeth, alveolar bone, dental follicle, tooth germ, and gingiva are all different sources for isolation and expansion of MSCs. Dental MSCs have regenerative and immunomodulatory properties; they are scarcely immunogenic but actively modulate T cell reactivity. in vitro studies and animal models of autoimmune diseases have provided evidence for the suppressive effects of dental MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, clearance of apoptotic cells, and promotion of a shift in the Treg/Th17 cell ratio. Appropriately stimulated MSCs produce anti-inflammatory mediators, such as transforming growth factor- (TGF-), prostaglandin E2, and interleukin (IL)-10. A particular mechanism through which MSCs exert their immunomodulatory action is via the production of extracellular vesicles containing such anti-inflammatory mediators. Recent studies demonstrated MSC-mediated inhibitory effects both on monocytes and activated macrophages, promoting their polarization to an anti-inflammatory M2-phenotype.

INTERVENTION(S) After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0C for 38.5  9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5C, participants were immersed in a 2.0C circulated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5C or 38.6C. Subsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 minutes at an ambient temperature of 25C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured continuously during the immersion and recovery periods. RESULTS Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was greater during the 37.5C trial (16.6  5.7 minutes) than the 38.6C trial (8.8  2.6 minutes) (t(9) = -4.740, P = .001). During the recovery period after cold-water immersion, both rectal (F(1,9) = 50.540, P < .001) and esophageal (F(1,6) = 20.365, P = .007) temperatures remained greater in the 38.6C trial than in the 37.5C trial.

The present research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring the unique transition period from home, school or college into university in order to identify aspects of the university experience (teaching, curriculum, support services, accommodation) that could be adapted to better support student mental health and well-being. Eight focus groups were conducted across two higher education institutions in North West England. Focus group data were thematically analyzed. Four overarching themes were identified: Tackling multiple challenges; The preparatory role of schools and colleges; University staff and services: Feeling supported/unsupported; and Friendships. Although pressure to perform academically whilst fulfilling the stereotypical student life is keenly felt during the transition period, many students conceal their struggles from family and friends. Living beyond their familiar support structures often leaves students in need of compassionate humans to turn to for support or advice, especially as many keep their struggles hidden. Large-group teaching settings stifle social connection and leave students feeling lonely. Loneliness was also experienced within accommodation environments. Providing increased opportunities for connection within living and learning environments would enable young people to build and strengthen relationships with fellow students and staff.

Here, we will briefly review the clinic characteristics of HHHS patients and the histological feature of their hepatic inclusions, and we will focus on the molecular genetic basis of this peculiar type of coagulopathy.","output":"Hereditary Hypofibrinogenemia with Hepatic Storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we investigated the mechanisms of Baihu Decoction ((׻, BH) and Baihu with Radix Ginseng (BHG) in treating systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis in humans and animals. By reviewing published data on the effects of BH and BHG and the control of blood glucose in treating SIRS and sepsis, we found that (1) BH and BHG were beneficial in the treatment of SIRS and sepsis in humans and animals; (2) BH and BHG also had great effect in lowering blood glucose level; and (3) the tight control of blood glucose during critical illness substantially improved the outcome. Considering these data together, we hypothesize that one of the major mechanisms of BH and BHG in treating SIRS and sepsis is to lower the blood glucose level. The findings also suggest that the application of BH and BHG can extend to many acute illnesses and injuries, which commonly cause hyperglycemia.","output":"The effect of Baihu Decoction (׻) on blood glucose levels in treating systemic inflammatory response syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although transitional care interventions can improve health among patients hospitalized with acute conditions, few interventions use patient quality of life (QOL) as the primary outcome. Existing interventions use a variety of intervention components, are not effective for patients of all races and ethnicities, do not address age-related patient needs, and do not incorporate the needs of families. The purpose of this study was to systematically review characteristics of transitional care intervention studies that aimed to improve QOL for younger adult patients of all race and ethnicities who were hospitalized with acute conditions. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of empirical literature available in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO by November 19, 2019 to identify studies of hospital to home care transitions with QOL as the primary outcome. Data extraction on study design and intervention components was limited to studies of patients aged 18-64. RESULTS Nineteen articles comprising 17 studies met inclusion criteria. There were a total of 3,122 patients across all studies (range: 28-536). Populations of focus included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, breast cancer, and kidney disease. Seven QOL instruments were identified. All interventions were multi-component with a total of 31 different strategies used. Most interventions were facilitated by a registered nurse. Seven studies discussed intervention facilitator training and eight discussed intervention materials utilized. No studies specified cultural tailoring of interventions or analyzed findings by racial/ethnic subgroup. CONCLUSIONS Future research is needed to determine which intervention components, either in isolation or in combination, are effective in improving QOL. Future studies should also elaborate on the background and training of intervention facilitators and on materials utilized and may also consider incorporating differences in culture, race and ethnicity into all phases of the research process in an effort to address and reduce any health disparities.","output":"Transitions of care interventions to improve quality of life among patients hospitalized with acute conditions: a systematic literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dark web marketplaces (DWMs) are online platforms that facilitate illicit trade among millions of users generating billions of dollars in annual revenue. Recently, two interview-based studies have suggested that DWMs may also promote the emergence of direct user-to-user (U2U) trading relationships. Here, we quantify the scale of, and thoroughly investigate, U2U trading around DWMs by analysing 31 million Bitcoin transactions among users of 40 DWMs between June 2011 and Jan 2021. We find that half of the DWM users trade through U2U pairs generating a total trading volume greater than DWMs themselves. We then show that hundreds of thousands of DWM users form stable trading pairs that are persistent over time. Users in stable pairs are typically the ones with the largest trading volume on DWMs. Then, we show that new U2U pairs often form while both users are active on the same DWM, suggesting the marketplace may serve as a catalyst for new direct trading relationships. Finally, we reveal that stable U2U pairs tend to survive DWM closures and that they were not affected by COVID-19, indicating that their trading activity is resilient to external shocks.

Documenting the benefits can help drive more ambitious and health-protective climate change mitigation actions; however, documenting the adverse health effects can help to avoid them. Estimating the health effects of mitigation (HEM) actions can help policy makers prioritize investments based not only on mitigation potential but also on expected health benefits. To date, however, the wide range of incompatible approaches taken to developing and reporting HEM estimates has limited their comparability and usefulness to policymakers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort was to generate guidance for modeling studies on scoping, estimating, and reporting population health effects from climate change mitigation actions. METHODS: An expert panel of HEM researchers was recruited to participate in developing guidance for conducting HEM studies. The primary literature and a synthesis of HEM studies were provided to the panel. Panel members then participated in a modified Delphi exercise to identify areas of consensus regarding HEM estimation. Finally, the panel met to review and discuss consensus findings, resolve remaining differences, and generate guidance regarding conducting HEM studies. RESULTS: The panel generated a checklist of recommendations regarding stakeholder engagement: HEM modeling, including model structure, scope and scale, demographics, time horizons, counterfactuals, health response functions, and metrics; parameterization and reporting; approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; accounting for policy uptake; and discounting. DISCUSSION: This checklist provides guidance for conducting and reporting HEM estimates to make them more comparable and useful for policymakers. Harmonization of HEM estimates has the potential to lead to advances in and improved synthesis of policy-relevant research that can inform evidence-based decision making and practice. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6745","output":"Guidelines for Modeling and Reporting Health Effects of Climate Change Mitigation Actions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The American democratic system of government is being put to its greatest test since the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s, as the country endeavors to cope with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Precautionary behavior practices and psychological characteristics of confirmed and quarantined persons were investigated for planning pandemic recovery and preparedness. Methods: this study was conducted with 1716 confirmed patients and quarantined persons in Daegu and Busan, regions where a high number of cases were confirmed during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. We collected online survey data from 23 April to 20 May 2020, in Daegu, and 28 April to 27 May 2020, in Busan, in cooperation with Daegu and Busan Infectious Disease Control Centers and public health centers in the regions. COVID-19 symptoms, pre-cautionary behavior practices, psychological states, and the need for improvement in isolation/quarantine environments were examined using an online survey. Results: compared to patients infected with coronavirus, quarantined persons engaged in more hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing, cough etiquette, and proper mask-wearing) and social distancing. COVID-19 patients had a strong fear of stigma, while quarantined persons had a strong fear of contracting COVID-19. Study participants responded that it was necessary to provide financial support and adequate information during isolation/quarantine.

RESULTS: 305 COVID-19 survivors were included (moderate: 162, severe: 143). 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was resolution of respiratory symptoms (37.9% in severe versus 27.3% in moderate pneumonia; p = 0.089). Exertional dyspnea was present (20% in severe vs 18.4% in moderate, p = 0.810). Abnormalities in chest radiology imaging were detected in severe COVID-19 infection versus moderate infection (29% versus 8.8%; p <0.001). Pulmonary function testing (forced spirometry or diffusion) performed at 12 months of mean follow-up according to protocol detected anomalies in 31.4% of patients with severe COVID-19 courses and in 27.7% of moderate patients. Risk factors associated with diffusion impairment at 12 months were age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10, p = 0.008), FEV1% predicted at follow-up (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99, p = 0.017) and dyspnea score at follow-up (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.43-6.97, p = 0.004). CT scans performed at 12 months of mean follow-up showed evidence of fibrosis in almost half of patients with severe COVID-19 courses, who underwent CT according to protocol. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months from infection onset, most patients refer to symptoms, particularly muscle weakness and dyspnea, and almost one third of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had impaired pulmonary diffusion and abnormalities in chest radiology imaging.

COVID-19 in pregnancy increases the likelihood of hospital admission and intensive care compared to non-pregnant women. Early administration of low-dose corticosteroids to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome can reduce all-cause mortality among such patients. However, during pregnancy, prolonged use of corticosteroids that readily cross the placenta like dexamethasone can negatively impact both the mother and foetus. Evidence is thus needed on the choice, timing, and duration for corticosteroids use among pregnant women with COVID-19. This article aims to provide evidence on corticosteroid use in pregnant women with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial deduced that low-dose dexamethasone (6 milligrams) reduced mortality by up to one-third among COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation and one-fifth among those who received supplemental oxygen. Pregnant women in this trial received either oral prednisolone or intravenous hydrocortisone. Based on the RECOVERY trial findings, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommends that pregnant women with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 receive oral prednisolone or intravenous hydrocortisone. However, currently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) does not explicitly specify which corticosteroid to use among pregnant women with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

Signaling involving TSP-1, through its cognate receptor CD47, orchestrates a wide array of cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization, migration, cell-cell interaction, cell proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the impact of TSP-1/CD47 signaling on Ca(2+) dynamics, survival, and deformability of human red blood cells (RBCs). METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp was employed to examine transmembrane cation conductance. RBC intracellular Ca(2+) levels and multiple indices of RBC cell death were determined using cytofluorometry analysis. RBC morphology and microvesiculation were examined using imaging flow cytometry. RBC deformability was measured using laser-assisted optical rotational cell analyzer. RESULTS: Exposure of RBCs to recombinant human TSP-1 significantly increased RBC intracellular Ca(2+) levels. As judged by electrophysiology experiments, TSP-1 treatment elicited an amiloride-sensitive inward current alluding to a possible Ca(2+) influx via non-selective cation channels. Exogenous TSP-1 promoted microparticle shedding as well as enhancing Ca(2+)- and nitric oxide-mediated RBC cell death. Monoclonal (mouse IgG1) antibody-mediated CD47 ligation using 1F7 recapitulated the cell death-inducing effects of TSP-1. Furthermore, TSP-1 treatment altered RBC cell shape and stiffness (maximum elongation index). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data unravel a new role for TSP-1/CD47 signaling in mediating Ca(2+) influx into RBCs, a mechanism potentially contributing to their dysfunction in a variety of systemic diseases.","output":"Thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling modulates transmembrane cation conductance, survival, and deformability of human red blood cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chlorine disinfectants were widely used during the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) Water quality and human health might be affected by chlorine residues Residual chlorine and its guideline value was not set in the quality standards of drinking water sources in China The lack of result evaluation and standards of field rapid analysis methods were also problems to be solved In order to provide a reference for monitoring and evaluation of residual chlorine in water in public health events, the domestic and international guideline values, laboratory analysis standards and field rapid analysis methods for residual chlorine in drinking water were summarized The results showed that:(1) The guideline values of residual chlorine in the distribution systems(0 1-2 0 mg/L) and at the point of delivery(0 1-1 8 mg/L), and the maximum concentration of residual chlorine in drinking water(4-5 mg/L) were set by other countries, regions and WHO (2) Colorimetric and titrimetric methods were considered as standards or recommended analytical methods for laboratories because of their rapid response,stability, high accuracy and high precision High performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) could also be applied for trace analysis of residual chlorine due to its low detection limit and high sensitivity (3) Most field rapid analysis and on-line monitoring methods were colorimetric and electrochemical methods, but there was no uniform standard method The research showed that the maximum concentration of residual chlorine in drinking water in foreign countries, regions or organizations was 5 mg/L The recommended minimum concentrations for residual chlorine to point of delivery were 0 5 mg/L in high-risk circumstances It was suggested to carry out the standardization research on the field monitoring methods of water","output":"Review of domestic and foreign guideline values and monitoring methods of residual chlorine in drinking water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of skin manifestations, including chilblain\\\\like, urticarial, vesicular and vasculitic lesions.

gas development in the area, due to its temporal and spatial correlation Prior to such development, the area was seismically quiescent Here, we show evidence that latent seismicity may occur in areas where previous operations have occurred, even during a shutdown in operations The global COVID-19 pandemic furnished the unique opportunity to study seismicity during a long period of anthropogenic quiescence Within the Kiskatinaw area of British Columbia, 389 events were detected from April to August 2020, which encompasses a period with very little hydraulic fracturing operations This reduction in operations was the result of a government-imposed lockdown severely restricting the movement of people as well as a downturn in the economic market causing industry stock prices to collapse Except for a reduction in the seismicity rate and a lack of temporal clustering that is often characteristic of hydraulic fracturing induced sequences, the general characteristics of the observed seismicity were similar to the preceding time period of active operations During the period of relative quiescence, event magnitudes were observed between ML -0 7 and ML 1 2, which is consistent with previous event magnitudes in the area Hypocentres occurred in a corridor orientated NWCSE, just as seismicity had done in previous years, and were located at depths associated with the target Montney formation or shallower (&lt;2 5 km) A maximum of 21 % of the detected events during lockdown may be attributable to natural seismicity, with a further 8 % potentially attributed to dynamic triggering of seismicity from teleseismic events and 6 % related to ongoing saltwater disposal and a single operational well pad However, this leaves 65 % of the seismicity detected during lockdown being unattributable to primary activation mechanisms This seismicity is unlikely to be the result of direct pore pressure increases (as very little direct injection of fluids was occurring at the time) and we see no patterns of temporal or spatial migration in the seismicity as would be expected from direct pore pressure increases Instead, we suggest that this latent seismicity may be generated by aseismic slip as fluids (resulting from previous hydraulic fracturing injection) become trapped within permeable formations at depth, keeping pore pressures in the area elevated and

Ultrasound-measured tumor-free distance from the tumor to the uterine serosa (uTFD) is a promising marker for these diagnostic and prognostic variables. The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of this biomarker in locoregional staging, and thus in the prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Methods: We conducted a single-institutional, prospective study on 116 consecutive patients with EC who underwent 2D transvaginal ultrasound examination. The uTFD marker was compared with the depth of ultrasound-measured myometrial invasion (uMI). Univariable and multivariable logit models were evaluated to assess the predictive power of the uTFD and uMI in regard to LNM. The reference standard was a final histopathology result. Survival was assessed by the KaplanCMeier method. Results: LNM was found in 17% of the patients (20/116). In the univariable analysis, uMI and uTFD were significant predictors of LNM. The accuracy was 70.7%, and the NPV was 92.68% (OR 4.746, 95% CI 1.710C13.174) for uMI (p = 0.002), and they were 63.8% and 89.02% (OR 0.842, 95% CI 0.736C0.963), respectively, for uTFD (p = 0.01). The cutoff value for uTFD in the prediction of LNM was 5.2 mm. The association between absence of LNM and biomarker values of uMI < 1/2 and uTFD  5.2 mm was greater than that between the presence of metastases and uMI > 1/2 and uTFD values <5.2 mm. In the multivariable analysis, the accuracy of the uMICuTFD model was 74%, and its NPV was 90.24% (p = non-significant). Neither uMI nor uTFD were surrogates for overall and recurrence-free survivals in endometrial cancer. Conclusions: Both uMI and uTFD, either alone or in combination, were valuable tools for gaining additional preoperative information on expected lymph node status. Negative lymph nodes status was better described by ultrasound biomarkers than a positive status. It was easier to use the uTFD rather than the uMI measurement as a biomarker of EC invasion, and the former still maintained a similar predictive value for lymph node metastases to the latter at diagnosis.","output":"Ultrasound Measurement of Tumor-Free Distance from the Serosal Surface as the Alternative to Measuring the Depth of Myometrial Invasion in Predicting Lymph Node Metastases in Endometrial Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children are at heightened risk of maltreatment during community wide crises.

We developed a model that integrated sourceCenvironmentCreceptor pathways to evaluate how preventive efforts can reduce the infection risk among spectators at the opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympic Games. We simulated viral loads of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emitted from infectors through talking/coughing/sneezing and modeled temporal environmental behaviors, including virus inactivation and transfer. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected number of newly infected individuals with and without preventive measures, yielding the crude probability of a spectator being an infector among the 60,000 people expected to attend the opening ceremony. Two indicators, i.e., the expected number of newly infected individuals and the newly infected individuals per infector entry, were proposed to demonstrate the extent of achievable infection risk reduction levels by implementing possible preventive measures. A no-prevention scenario produced 1.5C1.7 newly infected individuals per infector entry, whereas a combination of cooperative preventive measures by organizers and the spectators achieved a 99% risk reduction, corresponding to 0.009C0.012 newly infected individuals per infector entry. The expected number of newly infected individuals was calculated as 0.005 for the combination of cooperative preventive scenarios with the crude probability of a spectator being an infector of 1  10(?5). Based on our estimates, a combination of cooperative preventions between organizers and spectators is required to prevent a viral spread at the Tokyo Olympic/Paralympic Games. Further, under the assumption that society accepts < 10 newly infected persons traced to events held during the entire Olympic/Paralympic Games, we propose a crude probability of infectors of < 5  10(?5) as a benchmark for the suppression of the infection.

The article also presents different strategies employed during the last five years to block interactions between TREMs and their ligands to treat various disease conditions by modulating their expression and activity. Expert opinion: There has been significant progress in the discovery of novel ligands and modulators of TREMs in the last five years that mainly revolved around the function of TREM molecules. A few peptides showed encouraging results to modulate the expression and activity of TREMs in pre-clinical studies, and these peptides are currently in clinical investigation.

Few studies have attempted to understand or model the different approaches to leadership which are used when promoting the uptake and implementation of evidence-based interventions. This research aims to uncover and explain how distributed clinical leadership can be developed and improved to enhance the use of evidence in practice. In doing so, this study examines implementation leadership in orthopaedic surgery to explain leadership as a collective endeavour which cannot be separated from the organisational context. METHODS A mixed-method study consisting of longitudinal and cross-sectional interviews and an embedded social network analysis will be performed in six NHS hospitals. A social network analysis will be undertaken in each hospital to uncover the organisational networks, the focal leadership actors and information flows in each organisation. This will be followed by a series of repeated semi-structured interviews, conducted over 4 years, with orthopaedic surgeons and their professional networks. These longitudinal interviews will be supplemented by cross-sectional interviews with the national established surgical leaders. All qualitative data will be analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach and integrated with the quantitative data. The participant narratives will enrich the social network to uncover the leadership configurations which exist, and how different configurations of leadership are functioning in practice to influence implementation processes and outcomes. DISCUSSION The study findings will facilitate understanding about how and why different configurations of leadership develop and under what organisational conditions and circumstances they are able to flourish. The study will guide the development of leadership interventions that are grounded in the data and aimed at advancing leadership for service improvement in orthopaedics. The strength of the study lies in the combination of multi-component, multi-site, multi-agent methods to examine leadership processes in surgery. The findings may be limited by the practical challenges of longitudinal qualitative data collection, such as ensuring participant retention, which need to be balanced against the theoretical and empirical insights generated through this comprehensive exploration of leadership across and within a range of healthcare organisations.","output":"Advancing clinical leadership to improve the implementation of evidence-based practice in surgery: a longitudinal mixed-method study protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower respiratory tract infections are caused by a wide range of pathogens and, where appropriate, antibiotic treatment should be chosen with resistance and side\\\\effects in mind.

We investigated the combined effects of long-term exposure to fine particle matter (PM2.5) and habitual exercise on deaths from natural causes in Taiwan. METHODS: We recruited 384 130 adults (aged &#8805; 18 yr) with 842 394 medical examination records between 2001 and 2016, and followed all participants until May 31, 2019. We obtained vital data from the National Death Registry of Taiwan. We estimated PM2.5 exposure using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model, and collected information on exercise habits using a standard self-administered questionnaire. We analyzed the data using a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: A higher level of habitual exercise was associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes, compared with inactivity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.88 for the moderate exercise group; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68 for the high exercise groups), whereas a higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of death from natural causes compared with lower exposure (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.07, and HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, for the moderate and high PM2.5 exposure groups, respectively). Compared with inactive adults with high PM2.5 exposure, adults with high levels of habitual exercise and low PM2.5 exposure had a substantially lower risk of death from natural causes. We found a minor, but statistically significant, interaction effect between exercise and PM2.5 exposure on risk of death (HR 1.03 95% CI 1.01-1.06). Subgroup analyses, stratified by PM2.5 categories, suggested that moderate and high levels of exercise were associated with a lower risk of death in each PM2.5 stratum, compared with inactivity. INTERPRETATION: Increased levels of exercise and reduced PM2.5 exposure are associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes. Habitual exercise can reduce risk regardless of the levels of PM2.5 exposure. Our results suggest that exercise is a safe health improvement strategy, even for people residing in relatively polluted regions.","output":"Effects of air pollution and habitual exercise on the risk of death: a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic diseases are the main contributor to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and present a major threat to global public health.

SUMMARY In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patient's behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities. It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations. Management of asthma in times of COVID-19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early.

The increase in international trade over the last thirty years, climate change owing to the industrial revolution, disruption of ecosystems, etc. are some of the factors that may explain the dynamics of disease emergence in regions of the world where they were not present. Thus in 1999, West Nile virus was introduced on the American continent where it spread at high speed. More than 2,300 deaths and more than 25,000 neuroinvasive forms were recorded in humans from 1999 to 2019 in the United States of America. In the field of animal diseases, two viruses have made headlines in Europe: bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). The bluetongue virus, previously absent from Europe, was introduced in 1999. Numerous serotypes (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 25, 27) have since been identified in the European Union. Schmallenberg virus was identified in 2011 in Northern Germany and rapidly spread to other European countries. This virus had never been identified in the world before.

Our aim was to assess the virus's persistence and the possibility of transmission in the post-mortem phase including autopsy staff. The sample group included 29 patients who were admitted to our Covid-19 Centre who died during hospitalisation and the autopsy staff. All the swabs were subjected to a one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with cycle threshold (Ct) values. Swab collection was performed at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, over 24 since death. The following were the analysis of patients' swabs: 10 cases were positive 2 h after death; 10 cases positive 4 h after death; 9 cases were found positive 6 h after death; 7 cases positive 12 h after death; 9 cases remained positive 24 h after death. The swabs performed on all the forensic pathologist staff on duty who performed the autopsies were negative. The choice to avoid rituals and the display of corpses before and at the burial procedures given appears cautiously valid due to the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the post-mortem period. Although the caution in choosing whether or not to perform an autopsy on infected corpses is acceptable, not to perform autopsies is not biologically supported.","output":"Analysis of the persistence time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cadaver and the risk of passing infection to autopsy staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy enables close monitoring of tumor response in patients with breast cancer. Being able to assess tumor response during treatment provides an opportunity to evaluate new therapeutic strategies. Thus, for triple-negative breast tumors, it was demonstrated that additional immunotherapy could improve prognosis compared with chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy can be escalated or de-escalated correspondingly. The CREATE-X trial randomly assigned HER2-negative patients with residual tumor after neoadjuvant therapy to either observation or capecitabine. In HER2-negative patients with positive BRCA testing, the OlympiA study randomly assigned patients to either observation or olaparib. HER2-positive patients without pathologic remission were randomly assigned to trastuzumab or trastuzumab-emtansine within the KATHERINE study. These studies were all able to show an improvement in oncologic outcome associated with the escalation of therapy in patients presenting with residual tumor after neoadjuvant treatment. On the other hand, this individualization of therapy may also offer the possibility to de-escalate treatment, and thereby reduce morbidity. Among WSG-ADAPT HER2+/HR-, HER2-positive patients achieved comparable results without chemotherapy after complete remission following neoadjuvant treatment. In summary, the concept of post-neoadjuvant therapy constitutes a great opportunity for individualized cancer treatment, potentially improving outcome.

In this study, they evaluated optimal respiratory rate during TBR under two-lung ventilation with low-tidal volume anesthesia. DESIGN A prospective, randomized, single-blinded intervention study. SETTING An operating room in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS Forty-eight patients who underwent scheduled TBR under general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS TBR was performed under low-tidal-volume (5 mL/kg), two-lung ventilation. Respiratory rate (RR) varied according to the protocol: 15 (group I), 18 (group II), and 22 cycles/min (group III). Using block randomization method, 16 patients were assigned to each of 3 groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Minute ventilation of group I was lowered significantly compared with the other groups (p<0.001). The results of arterial blood gas analysis were in the physiologic range in all patients. Surgery and anesthetic times and number of endostaples used were not significantly different among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS The RR of 15 cycles/min with low-tidal volume (5 mL/kg) and two-lung ventilation did not produce abnormal physiologic changes including arterial pH, partial arterial oxygen pressure, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide and guaranteed an optimal surgical field.

METHODS: This paper uses data from a national sample of 728 gay and bisexual men collected from April 10 to May 10, 2020, to examine changes to sexual behavior in response to the first wave of the pandemic in the USA. We also assess whether behavior modifications are associated with exposure to statewide public health measures, including Stay-at-Home orders. RESULTS: Sexual minority men report significant changes to their sexual behavior and partner selection during the first wave. Nine out of 10 men reported having either one sexual partner or no sexual partner in the last 30 days at the time of interview, a decrease compared to just before the pandemic for nearly half of men surveyed. Reporting no sexual partners in the last 30 days was significantly predicted by increased exposure to a Stay-at-Home order. Sexual minority men also reduced interactions with casual partners, increased no-contact sexual behaviors (e.g., masturbation and virtual sex), and engaged in new strategies to reduce their risks of infection from partners. HIV-positive men were particularly likely to adopt strategies including avoiding casual partners and avoiding public transportation to meet sexual partners. CONCLUSION: Sexual minority mens behavior changes during the first wave may have reduced the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their communities. Despite substantial changes in sexual behavior for most men in our sample during the initial first wave, we identify some concerns around the sustainability of certain behavioral changes over time and nondisclosure of COVID-19 symptoms to partners.","output":"Sexual Behavior Change Among Gay and Bisexual Men During the First COVID-19 Pandemic Wave in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona Pandemic, also known as the COVID-19, which gripped the entire world from the beginning of 2020, has been hitting Afghanistan, which has already been facing socio-economic, health, educational, and safety problems starting in the pre-pandemic period, very hard.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the correlation of respiratory impedance at rest with exertional ventilatory parameters, including exercise tolerance, has scarcely been reported. In addition, the utility of oscillometric parameters might differ between the inspiratory and expiratory phases due to airflow obstruction during expiration, but the hypothesis had not been validated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oscillometric parameters are associated with exertional ventilatory parameters in patients with COPD. Methods Fifty-five subjects with COPD who attended clinics at the National Hospital Organization Osaka Toneyama Medical Center performed spirometry, oscillometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within 2 weeks. The correlations between parameters of spirometry, oscillometry, and CPET were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, univariate, and multivariate analyses. Results Respiratory reactance had better correlations with the CPET parameters than respiratory resistance. Moreover, inspiratory reactance at rest correlated with the CPET parameters stronger than expiratory reactance. In particular, inspiratory resonant frequency (Fres-ins) correlated with peak oxygen uptake (rS=-0.549, p<0.01) and dead space to tidal volume ratio at peak exercise (rS=0.677, p<0.01) and the best predicted expiratory tidal volume (VT ex) at peak exercise of all the oscillometric parameters (rS=-0.679, p<0.01). However, the correlation between Fres-ins and V T ex at peak exercise became weak in subjects with severe and very severe COPD during exercise. Conclusion Measurement of respiratory reactance is useful for the effortless evaluation of not only exertional ventilatory parameters but exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. The correlation of respiratory impedance with exertional ventilatory parameters can become weak in patients with advanced COPD; thus, the measurement of oscillometry might not be appropriate for evaluating exertional ventilatory parameters of patients with advanced COPD.","output":"Evaluation of Exertional Ventilatory Parameters Using Oscillometry in COPD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted worldwide, which contributed to various psychological problems (such as fear, depression, and anxiety) among the general population in China.

We aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions in sever disease manifestation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 742 patients with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection at King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital, from April 2020 and July 2020. Inpatients, outpatient, including those with sever manifestation treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. We collected data including demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among of 742 patients, 71 (9.6%) were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 75 months old and 53.6 were male. A total of 461 (62.1%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 45 (6.1%) had no contact history, and 236 (31.8%) with unknown exposure risk. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (32.5%), respiratory symptoms (21%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.3%).

BACKGROUND Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) biodegradable stents have been shown to be effective in the coronaries, but no data are available regarding their efficacy in the femoral artery. METHODS A prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study enrolled 30 patients with symptomatic de novo SFA disease undergoing implantation of Igaki-Tamai bioresorbable stents. Clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound were prospectively performed after 1, 6, 9, and 12 months. The main study endpoints were technical success, restenosis rate, rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR), changes in ankle-brachial index (ABI), and quality of life by evaluating the walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ). Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of major adverse clinical events and serious adverse events. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 67.7 years, and 77% were male. The mean lesion length was 5.9 cm. Mean diameter stenosis was reduced from 89.9% to 6.2%, after stent implantation. Technical success was 96.7%. Binary restenosis rate for the 6 and 12 months follow-up was 39.3% and 67.9%, respectively. The TLR rate was 25.0% after 6 months and 57.1% after 12 months. All TLR were successful; the secondary patency rate after 1 year was 89.3%. Between baseline and 12 months, ABI increased in 53.6% of patients.

Data of students' confidence in all five monitored essential abilities are collected before and after the learning procedure through questionnaires, and students' feedbacks are collected through interviews. The statistical results show that multimedia networks can help students improve their overall competence, especially in gaining work experience and practical English skills. Moreover, adopting multimedia networks in teaching can provide more internship opportunities, enrich teaching scenarios, and prolong net teaching hours, which forms a preferred learning environment and provides better learning outcomes.

Since nucleic acids amplification techniques such as RT-PCR have been adapted, fast and sensitive influenza type and subtype determination is possible. However, in some ambiguous cases other, more detailed assay might be desired. The genetic material of influenza virus is highly unstable and constantly mutates. It is known that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) results in resistance to commercially available anti-viral drugs. The genetic drift of the virus could also result in weakening of immune response to infection. Finally, in a substantial number of patients co-infection with various virus strains or types has been confirmed. Although the detection of co-infection or presence of minor genetic variants within flu-infected patients is not a routine procedure, a rapid and wide spectrum diagnostics of influenza virus infections could reveal an accurate picture of the disease and more importantly, is crucial for choosing the appropriate therapeutics and virus monitoring.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was &#8805;96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

In this study, we developed the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model, which incorporates the key epidemiological parameters to model and estimate the long-term spread of the COVID-19. The proposed model formulation is data-based analysis using public COVID-19 data from March 2, 2020 to May 15, 2021.

OBJECTIVE To assess whether patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID present higher risk of worse outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING Rapid systematic review conducted in the medical school of the Federal University of S?o Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, LOVE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for studies evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID. Two authors selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence, following the Cochrane recommendations. RESULTS We identified 1,498 references, from which one cohort study was included. This compared patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD) who all had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Those with RD seemed to have higher chances of hospitalization and mortality, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups: hospitalization: odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.29; mortality rate: OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 7.11 (very low certainty of evidence). Patients with RD were three times more likely to require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), than those without RD: OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 10.26 (for both outcomes; very low certainty of evidence).

Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing. OBJECTIVE: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data. METHODS: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service. RESULTS: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.","output":"The Architecture of a Feasibility Query Portal for Distributed COVID-19 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Patient Data Repositories: Design and Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry 4.0.

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they dont have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it, so, numerous research studies are needed to find potential. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified in previous studies and can cause lung injury with ARDS, so, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease.","output":"Hypothesis for the management and treatment of the COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury using mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been proposed as a useful marker that can show the performance adaptation and optimize the training process in elite athletes.

To our knowledge there have been no reports of neonatal hypocalcemia following maternal SARS-CoV2 infection at the time of birth. Here we report a case of transient late-onset neonatal hypocalcemia complicated by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of delivery. Clinical Case: A 13-day old full-term appropriate for gestational age female was born to an asymptomatic mother who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 at the time of delivery. Caretakers noticed minor twitching movements in the first few days of life that were progressively worsening. Initial ionized calcium was 0.6 mmol/L, and labs at time of transfer to our hospital were notable for total calcium of 5.5mg/dL(n 8.9C9.9), and ionized calcium of 0.67mmol/L (n 1.12C1.37 mmol/L). Calcium levels improved after she received IV calcium boluses and was started on continuous IV calcium infusion. Initial phosphorus was 8.3 mg/dL (n 3.2C7.4 mg/dL) and magnesium was 1.2 mg/dL (n 1.5C2.2 mg/dL), while intact PTH was inappropriately low at 12.2 pg/mL (n 10C65 pg/mL), and urine calcium to urine creatinine ratio was below the limits of assay detection (n <0.86), consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal hypoparathyroidism. The 25-hydroxy vitamin D was 11.1 ng/mL (n 30C100 ng/mL), which may have also been a contributing factor. She had no dysmorphic features on examination concerning for 22q deletion syndrome, and tested negative for SARS-CoV2. Chromosomal microarray did not reveal clinically relevant copy number alterations or areas of homozygosity. Calcium stabilized on enteral calcium carbonate, calcitriol, and cholecalciferol, and she was weaned off of all supplementation. Prior to discharge PTH recovered to 36.9 pg/ml with a calcium of 9.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 7.7 mg/dL, normal magnesium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (31.3 ng/ml). She was discharged on Similac PM 60/40 formula to reduce her dietary phosphorus content, and 400 IU of cholecalciferol. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia in patients with severe COVID-19 is being increasingly reported. There is minimal data on the effect of perinatal SARS-CoV2 infections on neonatal health. While this report does not establish causation, expanding awareness of neonatal abnormalities following maternal SARS-CoV2 infection at delivery will help to recognize causal associations and improve patient care.","output":"Late-Onset Neonatal Hypocalcemia Due to Transient Hypoparathyroidism in Infant of Mother With COVID-19 at Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyzed the effects of an educational glass recycling program on primary schools and their students in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain).

METHODS: Postmenopausal osteoporosis patients with a high risk of fracture154 in totalwere recruited; their therapies were switched to ROMO or DENO from BP/na?ve or vitamin D (ND) (ND-ROMO: 43, BP-ROMO: 38, ND-DENO: 38, and BP-DENO: 35). Longitudinal changes in bone metabolic markers and BMD were evaluated. RESULTS: ROMO groups showed significant increases in BMD of the lumbar spine at 6 and 12 months and femoral neck at 12 months compared to the DENO groups.

A representative sample of respondents was randomly selected using a multi-stage sampling technique from the most vulnerable segment of the population. This data was collected from mid-July to mid-August in 2020 a few months from the date the first case was reported in the country. The impact of the containment measures on food security, health, nutrition, education, and protection of women and children was analysed using descriptive and empirical models. While the binary logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of women and children experiencing food insecurity and the likelihood of experiencing limited access to the justice system. COVID-19 presented grave economic and psychological stress to the community, women, and children. Four in 10 women reported increased incidents of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and limited access to food and justice during the COVID-19 outbreak. Children and women living in Internally Displaced People (IDP) centres and refugees are most vulnerable to the negative impact of COVID-19.

There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (P = 0.123). There were five departments and two professions in which >20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. Temporal clusters were identified in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than five days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and one patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (interquartile range: 15-26) days. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HCW-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in a hospital in Madrid, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common infection presenting in the community. Clinical guidelines and decision aids assist health practitioners to treat a UTI; however, treatment practices vary due to patient needs and context of presentation. Numerous trials have evaluated the effectiveness of treatment interventions for UTI; however, it is difficult to compare the results between trials due to inconsistencies between reported outcomes. Poor choice of outcome measures can lead to impairment of evidence synthesis due to the inability to compare outcomes between trials with similar aims. Transparency in selecting and reporting outcomes can be mitigated through the development of an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in clinical trials, referred to as a core outcome set (COS). This paper presents the protocol for the development of a COS for interventions in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adults. METHODS This COS development consists of three phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review, which aims to identify the core outcomes that have been reported in trials and systematic reviews of interventions treating uncomplicated UTI in adults. Phase 2 consists of a three-round online Delphi survey with stakeholders in the area of treatment interventions for UTI. The aim of this online Delphi survey is to achieve consensus on the importance of the outcomes emerging from Phase 1 of this research. Phase 3 is a consensus meeting to finalise the COS that should be reported in trials evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of UTI. DISCUSSION It is hoped that the development of a COS for interventions for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adults will be adopted as a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported and measured within this context. If the findings from clinical trials related to treatment interventions for UTI are to impact on policy and practice, it is important that the findings from different treatment interventions are comparable across trials.","output":"COSUTI: a protocol for the development of a core outcome set (COS) for interventions for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of COVID-19 has brought changes in adolescents' daily routines, restrictions to in-person interactions, and serious concerns about the situation.

Studies suggest a variable impact of COVID-19 based on factors such as age, gender, comorbidities and ethnicity. Workplace measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing (SD) and avoidance of exposure for the vulnerable, mitigate this risk. This online questionnaire-based study explored the impact of gender and religion in addition to workplace measures associated with risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors in acute and mental health institutions in the UK. The survey had 1206 responses, majority (94%) from BAME backgrounds. A quarter of the respondents had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19, a similar proportion reported inadequate PPE and 2/3 could not comply with SD. One third reported being reprimanded in relation to PPE or avoidance of risk. In univariate analysis, age over 50 years, being female, Muslim and inability to avoid exposure in the workplace was associated with risk of COVID-19. On multivariate analysis, inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with a twofold (OR 2.29, (CI - 1.22-4.33), p=0.01) risk of COVID-19. This study demonstrates that PPE, SD and workplace measures to mitigate risk remain important for reducing risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors.

Unlike the USSR, it neither seeks hegemony, nor aspires to evangelise and export its political and economic system. It acts out of self-interest and seeks to become both a model nation for developing countries to emulate and the dominant rule-setter in the international trade and financial system. The strategy of constructive engagement, or liberal internationalism, is no longer working, but a more confrontational relationship with China could be economically costly and politically dangerous. There is an alternative to simple confrontation and military competition that could promote the goal of a freer, more peaceful world more effectively. The West may have to restrain sensitive trade and respond robustly to the Chinese governments actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and against Asian neighbours. However, this could be supplemented with a programme of engagement between private individuals, organisations, and firms in free societies with their Chinese counterparts.

We investigate the role of dynamical correlations on the 2SCP on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks using pairwise mean-field theory. This approach is compared with the ordinary one-site theory and stochastic simulations. We show that our approach significantly outperforms the one-site theory. In particular, the stationary state of the 2SCP model on random regular networks is very accurately reproduced by the pairwise mean-field, even for relatively small values of vertex degree, where expressive deviations of the standard mean-field are observed. The pairwise approach is also able to capture the transition points accurately for heterogeneous networks and provides rich phase diagrams with transitions not predicted by the one-site method.

In the operating room, this potentially exposes personnel to aerosolized viruses as well as carcinogens. In light of circumstances surrounding COVID-19 and a concern for the safety of healthcare professionals, our study seeks to quantify the volumes of gas leaked from dynamic interactions between laparoscopic instruments and the trocar port to better understand potential exposure to surgically aerosolized particles. METHODS: A custom setup was constructed to simulate an insufflated laparoscopic surgical cavity. Two surgical instrument use scenarios were examined to observe and quantify opportunities for insufflation gas leakage. Both scenarios considered multiple configurations of instrument and trocar port sizes/dimensions: (1) the full insertion and full removal of a laparoscopic instrument from the port and (2) the movement of the scope within the port, recognized as \\"dynamic interaction\\", which occurs nearly 100% of the time over the course of any procedure. RESULTS: For a 5 mm instrument in a 5 mm trocar, the average volume of gas leaked during dynamic interaction and full insertion/removal scenarios were 43.67 and 25.97 mL of gas, respectively. Volume of gas leaked for a 5 mm instrument in a 12 mm port averaged 41.32 mL and 29.47 for dynamic interaction vs. instrument insertion and removal. Similar patterns were shown with a 10 mm instrument in 12 mm port, with 55.68 mL for the dynamic interaction and 58.59 for the instrument insertion/removal. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic interactions and insertion/removal events between laparoscopic instruments and ports appear to contribute to consistent leakage of insufflated gas into the OR. Any measures possible taken to reduce OR gas leakage should be considered in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Minimizing laparoscope and instrument removal and replacement would be one strategy to mitigate gas leakage during laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Stop the leak!: Mitigating potential exposure of aerosolized COVID-19 during laparoscopic surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In acute respiratory failure due to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, mechanical ventilation remains challenging and may result in high mortality. The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may delay required invasive ventilation, increase adverse outcomes, and have a potential aerosol risk to caregivers. Data of 30 patients were collected from patient files and analyzed. Twenty-one (70%) patients were weaned successfully after helmet-NIV support (NIV success group), and invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 9 (30%) patients (NIV failure group) of which 8 (26.7%) patients died. In NIV success vs failure patients, the mean baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (PFR) (147.2  57.9 vs 156.8  59.0 mm Hg; p = 0.683) and PFR before initiation of helmet (132.3  46.9 vs 121.6  32.7 mm Hg; p = 0.541) were comparable. The NIV success group demonstrated a progressive improvement in PFR in comparison with the failure group at 2 hours (158.8  56.1 vs 118.7  40.7 mm Hg; p = 0.063) and 24 hours (PFR-24) (204.4  94.3 vs 121.3  32.6; p = 0.016). As predictor variables, PFR-24 and change (delta) in PFR at 24 hours from baseline or helmet initiation (dPFR-24) were significantly associated with NIV success in univariate analysis but similar significance could not be reflected in multivariate analysis perhaps due to a small sample size of the study. The PFR-24 cutoff of 161 mm Hg and dPFR-24 cutoff of ?1.44 mm Hg discriminate NIV success and failure groups with the area under curve (confidence interval) of 0.78 (0.62C0.95); p = 0.015 and 0.74 (0.55C0.93); p = 0.039, respectively.

The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50, 2 uM) was >35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Method: Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 ug/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Results: Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with higher exposure in lungs than plasma, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC50 in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0857 uM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.817 uM).

Finally, Shapley value is used to fairly allocate profits and represent the marginal contribution of each mode in multimodal transport. The numerical results show that multimodal transport can effectively reduce the distribution costs of last mile delivery in rural areas.

A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers.

All health personnel who care for such patients are at high risk of developing tuberculosis. It is very necessary for all healthcare providers, especially nurses, who spend a lot of time with such patients, to have adequate knowledge and correct practice on the occupational safety measures to maintain health and prevent transmission of the disease. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and practice of nurses in the prevention and control of TB infection. METHOD: This study was a cross-sectional study conducted on nurses working in all wards and Outpatient Departments (OPDs) of Western Regional Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. A complete enumeration of the respondents was performed, and data were collected consecutively, using a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire, from all nurses working in all the wards and OPDs of the hospital. The predictors of knowledge of TB infection prevention and control (TBIPC) were assessed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The study findings showed that a majority of nurses had an inadequate level of knowledge and poor practice of prevention and control of TB. Regarding practice, none of the nurses reported the use of an N95 mask or a respirator during care of the patients with TB and all the nurses reported that they used chemical disinfectant (virex) to clean the room and the surfaces. However, none of them reported the use of fumigation or ultraviolet irradiation for disinfection. Nurses who were 40 years and older (p = 0.001, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.965, CI = 2.083C17.457) and who were currently working in the wards with isolation rooms demonstrated higher odds for knowledge on TBIPC (p = 0.010, AOR = 2.686, CI = 1.264C5.710). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a majority of nurses had an inadequate level of knowledge and implemented poor safety measures for the prevention and control of tuberculosis. This increases their risk of being infected with TB infection and cross-transmission. It is recommended that the hospital plan and conduct the necessary education/training for nurses to update their knowledge, develop the organizational structure and policies, and establish a system to support and monitor the practice of health workers on the prevention and control of TB, and maintain the health and safety of nurses caring for patients with TB.","output":"Knowledge and Practice on Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Among Nurses Working in a Regional Hospital, Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Routine services for tuberculosis (TB) are being disrupted by stringent lockdowns against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated. Methods: We adapted mathematical models of TB transmission in three high-burden countries (India, Kenya and Ukraine) to incorporate lockdown-associated disruptions in the TB care cascade. The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. Findings: Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. If lockdown-related disruptions cause a temporary 50% reduction in TB transmission, we estimated that a 3-month suspension of TB services, followed by 10 months to restore to normal, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1a? 19 million TB cases (Crl 1a? 06-1a? 33) and 361,000 TB deaths (CrI 333-394 thousand) in India, 24,700 (16,100-44,700) TB cases and 12,500 deaths (8.8-17.8 thousand) in Kenya, and 4,350 (826-6,540) cases and 1,340 deaths (815-1,980) in Ukraine. The principal driver of these adverse impacts is the accumulation of undetected TB during a lockdown. We demonstrate how long term increases in TB burden could be averted in the short term through supplementary \\"catch-up\\" TB case detection and treatment, once restrictions are eased. Interpretation: Lockdown-related disruptions can cause long-lasting increases in TB burden, but these negative effects can be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services, and targeted interventions that are implemented as soon as restrictions are lifted.

METHODS: In this multicentre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, blinded, centrally randomised, stratified clinical trial, we randomly assigned adults with confirmed COVID-19 and severe hypoxia (use of mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen with a flow of at least 10 L/min) to either hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) versus a matching placebo for 7 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support at day 28 after randomisation. RESULTS: The trial was terminated early when 30 out of 1,000 participants had been enrolled because of external evidence indicating benefit from corticosteroids in severe COVID-19. At day 28, the median number of days alive without life support in the hydrocortisone versus placebo group were 7 versus 10 (adjusted mean difference: -1.1 days, 95% CI -9.5 to 7.3, p = 0.79); mortality was 6/16 versus 2/14; and the number of serious adverse reactions 1/16 versus 0/14.

Rotavirus (RV), a member of the Reoviridae family, still majorly accounts for the AGE in children below 5 years of age in India and worldwide. The involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of RV has been suggested to be of the proviral as well as the anti-viral nature. miRNAs that promote the RV pathogenesis are capable of targeting the cellular components to evade the host anti-viral strategies. On the other hand, miRNAs with anti-rotaviral properties are themselves incapacitated during the progression of the infection. The exploitation of the epithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT) as a pro-rotaviral strategy has already been identified. Thus, miRNAs that proficiently target the intermediates of the EMT pathway may serve as anti-viral counterparts in the RVChost interactions. The role of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in the majority of human cancers has been well demonstrated, but its significance in viral infections is yet to be elaborated. In this study, we have assessed the role of miR-29b in RV-induced EMT and RV replication. Our study on miR-29b provides evidence for the recruitment of RV non-structural protein NSP1 to control the trans-repression of miR-29b in a p53-dependent manner. The trans-repression of miR-29b modulates the EMT pathway by targeting tripartite motif-containing protein 44 (TRIM44) and cyclin E1 (CCNE1). SLUG and SNAIL transcription repressors (downstream of TRIM44 and CCNE1) regulate the expression of E-cadherin, an important marker of the EMT. Also, it is established that ectopic expression of miR-29b not only constrains the EMT pathway but also restricts RV replication. Therefore, miR-29b repression is a crucial event in the RV pathogenesis. Ectopic expression of miR-29b displays potential anti-viral properties against RV propagation.","output":"Rotavirus Induces EpithelialCMesenchymal Transition Markers by Transcriptional Suppression of miRNA-29b"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: : To study the association between knowledge of diseases caused by smoking, perceptions of harm of cigarettes and intention to quit among cigarettes and e-cigarettes users.

However, the dynamics of alpha oscillations, especially how the endogenous alpha oscillations be entrained by exogenous stimulus, are still unclear. Recently, a newly-developed phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF) protocol has shown effectiveness in modulating alpha rhythm, which provides empirical evidence for the further investigation of the neural mechanism of alpha dynamics. In this work, extensive numerical simulations based on four well-studied models were used to investigate the questions that (1) What kind of dynamic model exhibits a modulation phenomenon of PLVF? (2) What is the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for alpha modulation? (3) Which factors affect the modulation effects in PLVF? The result indicates that the dynamics of endogenous alpha oscillations are close to a simpler dynamic structure, like fixed-point attractor or limit-cycle attractor, which shows a global consistent dynamic behavior at different phases of the alpha oscillation. The further analysis explains the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for amplitude and frequency modulation of the alpha rhythm, as well as the influence of parameter settings in the modulation. All these findings provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous alpha oscillations entrained by exogenous phased locked visual stimulus and lead in turn to the refinement of a control strategy for alpha modulation, which could potentially be used in developing new neural modulation methods for cognitive enhancement and mental diseases treatment.","output":"Using a new phase-locked visual feedback protocol to affirm simpler models for alpha dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed a serious public health concern and started a race against time for researchers to discover an effective and safe therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, this method accurately predicted interaction energy changes in the crystal structure for 10 of 13 mutated residues in the Omicron variant, showing a significant change in the interaction energy of hACE2. S375F was found to be a mutation that majorly changed the binding affinity of the spike protein to hACE2 and the eight monoclonal antibodies.

This analysis of valbenazine clinical trial data, which is the first to evaluate an approved TD medication in a population 65 years, was conducted to better understand treatment outcomes in older patients. METHODS Data from two 48-week long-term studies (KINECT 3-extension, KINECT 4) were pooled and analyzed in older (65 years) and younger (<65 years) participants. Analyses based on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score included: mean change from baseline (BL); clinically meaningful response (30% improvement from BL [AIMS-30%]); and protocol-defined response (50% improvement from BL [AIMS-50%]). Additional analyses included response thresholds for Clinical Global Improvement-Tardive Dyskinesia and Patient Global Impression of Change as follows: rating of \\"minimally improved\\" or better (score 3) at week 48 (CGI-TD3, PGIC3); rating of \\"much improved\\" or \\"very much improved\\" (score 2) at week 48 (CGI-TD2, PGIC2). RESULTS AIMS outcomes in the older subgroup were generally comparable to (or better than) outcomes in the younger subgroup and overall study populations. In participants 65 years, pooled AIMS results indicated substantial improvements in TD movements with valbenazine 40 mg (n = 8) and 80 mg (n = 20): mean change from BL (-6.4 and -9.8 [for 40 and 80 mg, respectively]); AIMS-30% (75% and 95%); AIMS-50% (75% and 85%). CGI-TD and PGIC response rates indicated that clinician- and patient-reported global improvements were also substantial in the older subgroup: CGI-TD = 3 (88% and 100% [for 40 and 80 mg, respectively]); CGI-TD = 2 (88% and 95%); PGIC = 3 (88% and 100%); PGIC = 2 (75% and 90%).

In brief, -HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","output":"Features of ?-Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase during various specific periods in COVID-19 patients within Xiangyang, China: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Although use of telemedicine for the treatment of opioid use disorders (Tele-OUD) is growing, there is limited research on how it is actually being deployed in treatment. We explored how health centers across the U.S. are using tele-OUD in treatment as well as reasons for nonadoption. METHODS: We used the 2018 SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database and literature review to create a sample of community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telemental health services. From this list of health centers, we ued maximum diversity sampling to identify and recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. We used inductive and deductive approaches to develop site summaries. RESULTS: Twenty-two health centers from 14 different states participated. Of these, 8 offered tele-OUD. Among centers with tele-OUD, medication management was the most common service provided via video. Typically, health centers offered telemedicine visits after an initial, in-person visit with a waivered (prescribing) provider. Some programs only offered counseling via telemedicine. Leading barriers to treatment that tele-OUD program representatives mentioned included regulations on the prescribing of controlled substances, including buprenorphine, and difficulties in sending lab results to distant (prescribing) providers. Nonadopters reported not offering tele-OUD due to regulations in controlled substance prescribing, complexities and regulatory barriers to offering group visits, and the belief that in-person OUD services were meeting patient need. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-OUD is being deployed in a variety of ways. Describing current delivery models can inform strategies to promote and implement tele-OUD to combat the opioid epidemic.","output":"Health center implementation of telemedicine for opioid use disorders: A qualitative assessment of adopters and nonadopters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease that may occur after infections.As Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may bring about GBS, it is important to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on this diseaseObjectives: This study aimed to compare the distribution and characteristics of GBS during and before theCOVID-19 pandemic in an academic referral hospital in the north of Iran.Materials & Methods: This retrospective study assessed GBS distribution and characteristics during theCOVID-19 pandemic period (from March 2020 to the end of February 2021) and before the pandemic(from March 2019 to the end of February 2020) on 5340 patients referred to the Neurology Ward ofPoursina Hospital of Guilan Province, in Iran.Results: There was no significant difference between GBS distribution during (0.03%) and before (0.04%)the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.413).

Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 m). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs (Aerosol Generating Procedures), reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS: An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count/cubic foot (pc/ft3) within six channel sizes: 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and >10 m. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS: Aerosol emissions increased with increasing air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3-3 m). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 m) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc/ft3 at 1, 3 and 5 L/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H2O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSION: A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter. These data should be considered when designing measures to reduce in-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Chest drain aerosol generation in COVID-19 and emission reduction using a simple anti-viral filter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new SARS-CoV-2 virus differs from the pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype (H1N1pmd09) how it induces a pro-inflammatory response in infected patients. This study aims to evaluate the involvement of SNPs and tissue expression of IL-17A and the neutrophils recruitment in post-mortem lung samples from patients who died of severe forms of COVID-19 comparing to those who died by H1N1pdm09. Twenty lung samples from patients SARS-CoV-2 infected (COVID-19 group) and 10 lung samples from adults who died from a severe respiratory H1N1pdm09 infection (H1N1 group) were tested. The tissue expression of IL-8/IL-17A was identified by immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides were used for neutrophil scoring. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks, and genotyping was done in real time-PCR for two IL17A target polymorphisms. Tissue expression increasing of IL-8/IL-17A and a higher number of neutrophils were identified in samples from the H1N1 group compared to the COVID-19 group. The distribution of genotype frequencies in the IL17A gene was not statistically significant between groups. However, the G allele (GG and GA) of rs3819025 was correlated with higher tissue expression of IL-17A in the COVID-19 group.

Liver injury of COVID-19 patients based on severity grading and abdominal radiological signs have not been reported until now. The aim of our study is to determine clinical profiles of the patients based on severity grading, describe abdominal radiological signs, and investigate the correlations of the severity with clinical profiles and radiological signs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 115 patients with COVID-19 from Jan 2020 to Feb 2020. Medical records of the patients were collected and CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: Common clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 were fever (68.70%), cough (56.52%), fatigue (31.30%); some of them had gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, 12.17%; nausea or vomiting 7.83%; inappetence, 7.83%). Abnormal liver function was observed in some of patients with COVID-19. Significant differences in the levels of AST, albumin,CRP were observed among different groups classified by the severity. Common findings of upper abdominal CT scan were liver hypodensity (26.09%) and pericholecystic fat stranding (21.27%); liver hypodensity was more frequently found in critical cases (58.82%). The severity of COVID-19 correlated with semi-quantitative CT score of pulmonary lesions, CT-quantified liver/spleen attenuation ratio in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the patients with COVID-19 displayed liver damage revealed by liver functional tests and upper abdominal CT imaging, and the severity of COVID-19 patients correlated with some of liver functional tests and CT signs; thus, it will allow an earlier identification of high-risk patients for early effective intervention.

Mice were divided into normal diet, erythritol supplemented (5% w/w), and d-allulose supplemented (5% w/w) groups. Blood glucose and plasma glucagon levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the d-allulose group than in the normal diet group, and plasma insulin level was significantly increased. Further, d-allulose supplement significantly increased hepatic glucokinase activity and decreased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Expression of glucose transporter 4, insulin receptor substrate 1, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha and AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 were also upregulated by d-allulose supplement in adipocyte and muscle. Finally, d-allulose effectively lowered plasma and hepatic triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, and simultaneously reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activity.

The increased demand and synthesis from the pineal gland during times of oxidative stress suggests a potential benefit of melatonin supplementation during hospitalization for acute illness. Yet, the paucity of clinical studies for non-anesthetic-associated indications in pediatric populations hampers the safe, effective, and consistent use of melatonin. OBJECTIVE To systematically review published studies of melatonin use for non-sedative and non-analgesic indications in hospitalized pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted for articles on the use of melatonin for pediatric patients in a hospital setting. RESULTS Thirteen eligible studies, all in neonates, were identified. Data elements extracted included study design, number of study subjects, indication for melatonin therapy, and melatonin regimen (formulation, dosage, and duration). Because study methodologies were very heterogeneous, a quantitative synthesis of the published findings was not possible. The identified studies were therefore categorized by the indication of melatonin (adjuvant-antioxidant or anti-inflammatory therapy) in the following specific disease states: 1) acute infections, 2) respiratory distress syndrome, 3) neurologic injury, and 4) jaundice. CONCLUSIONS The current data suggest that melatonin is safe for use in hospitalized neonates. Melatonin may be beneficial for reducing inflammatory markers in neonatal patients with disease states and clinical sequelae that are associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Melatonin, in conjunction with phototherapy, is not superior to use of vitamin D with phototherapy for treatment of neonatal jaundice.

The overall incidence of ICH was also significantly lower (40.40% [non-stent retriever] vs 13.43% [stent retriever]; p = 0.002), with a trend toward lower 90-day mortality. Use of non-stent retriever devices was an independent predictor of mRS Scores 3-6 (p = 0.002), while use of stent retrievers was an independent predictor of TICI Score 3 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy devices achieve higher recanalization rates than non-stent retriever devices in acute ischemic stroke with improved clinical and radiographic outcomes and safety.","output":"Comparison of non-stent retriever and stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy devices for the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 Most patients infected with COVID-19 had clinical manifestations of dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue and malaise, pneumonia, and bilateral chest CT infiltration Soon COVID-19 spread around the world and turned into a pandemic Now this disease affects many patients around the world Patients with concomitant diseases have a high risk of COVID-19 infection, the infection is quite severe, leading to organ dysfunction, which is acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney damage, septic shock, pneumonia and death Currently, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an imminent threat to global public health Experts around the world are now actively searching for medicines that can stop the infection Despite the fact that some modern therapeutic drugs have demonstrated quite high capabilities in the field of prevention or treatment of patients with COVID-19, various side effects have occurred during their use Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the safety profile of therapeutic agents against COVID-19 is highly relevant","output":"Modern Approaches to the Study of Medicines Used in the Treatment of Patients Diagnosed with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD209 (DC-SIGN) is an important C-type lectin which acts a receptor of many pathogens.

Our results indicate that lockdowns managed to cause the epidemic to peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we found a change point during the decay from the peak, which does not correspond to obvious drastic legal interventions, but may be explained by widespread promotion and mandatory use of face masks. We confirm these interpretations at regional levels, and find that the gradual reopening of society since early May has caused no change in disease dynamics. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19 cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.","output":"Data-driven estimation of change points reveal correlation between face mask use and accelerated curtailing of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose From 2000 to 2050, the Latino population in the United States (U.S.) is expected to grow by 273%.

Funded with a Community Connections Grant through the GiveWhere You Live Foundation to reduce social isolation and support the social participation of vulnerable community members. Pet Playing for Placemaking is primarily a social and supportive experience. Responding to the isolation and social restrictions on vulnerable and older members of the Ocean Grove pet-owning community due to the COVID19 pandemic, this serious location-based game takes an innovative approach to the support and education of pet ownership in the community. The game invites older pet owners and local community members to partner up and compete in treasure-hunt style gameplay. Older pet owners, limited in mobility and vulnerable to the virus, must complete digital puzzles which reveal locations where their play partner (typically a volunteer or neighbour) can walk their pet and discovermore challenges that lead to other places (Figures 6C8). Co-operation iscritical, with each player supporting the other with their limitations. For example, older pet owners may have low technology literacy and require support to learn these features on their devices. At the same time, their fellow player may need local know-how and guidance to find the hidden locations and look after the pet in their care. The gameplay presents playful scenarios as content through digital-physical mechanics, encouraging players to explore such themes through play and engage with others in their local community.

The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited.

However, it presents unique challenges in rare diseases, particularly those that are young (not diagnosed before the twenty-first century), with limited literature, lack of disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and difficult sampling and data collection. One example of this is NUT (nuclear protein in testis) carcinoma (NUTca), a rare and rapidly progressing cancer, with tumors preliminary in the head, neck, and lungs. The published literature on NUTca is scarce. The limited number of case reports focus primarily on the clinical development and presentation of tumors. Currently, there are no publications describing the patient experience of NUTca and no specific PRO measures to assess the patient experience. We conducted mixed-methods research, including concept elicitation interviews, cognitive debriefing, and quantitative data analyses, to fill this evidence gap and describe challenges and solutions in the context of NUTca. METHODS: As published previously, our conceptualization of NUTca was based on elicitation interviews with 27 participants (n = 10 patients; n = 17 caregivers) using a semi-structured format; this framework formed the basis for a bolt-on strategy to develop a bespoke PRO measure based on the EORTC QLQ-C30, supplemented by targeted items from the EORTC Item Library and new items. In this publication, 20 participants were interviewed (n = 10 patients; n = 10 caregivers) to debrief items. Given the variety of tumor locations and related symptoms, and the small sample of patients providing responses to location-specific symptom items, we used response option endorsement frequencies to illuminate the variability of response for the concepts measured. RESULTS: This study highlights the challenges in implementing patient-centric research to inform and develop PRO measures in rare diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our mixed-methods research used pragmatic solutions to collect patient experience data and provides an evidence base to inform PCOM in clinical programs in this rapidly progressing rare cancer with high unmet need.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. METHODS: We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. RESULTS: Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells.

Results also indicate activation of a pro-apoptotic pathway. TLR2 was upregulated in both cases, but MyD88 was not. In the case of TBEV DIII, a MyD88 independent pathway was activated. Furthermore, both cases showed dramatic dysregulation of IFN and IFN-induced genes.

However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. METHODS: Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the diffusion of innovations theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs intention to apply RDD for CT. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons, and reaching contact persons more efficiently. Anticipated challenges were limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT, not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons, and anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. CONCLUSIONS: PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs intention to use RDD for CT.

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing LS were prospectively studied between 2005 and 2013. Preoperatively, patients were screened for prothrombotic states and surveillance duplex ultrasonography was performed between 1 week and 1 month postoperatively to assess for PSVT. The association between baseline prothrombotic disorders and PSVT was explored using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were included in the analysis, and 17 (25 %) of these developed PSVT. There were no differences in patients with and without PSVT with respect to age, body mass index, gender or surgical time. Preoperative spleen size, as determined by diagnostic imaging, and intraoperative blood transfusion were associated with PSVT. Seven of 9 patients (78 %) with massive splenomegaly (>20 cm) developed PSVT compared with 4 of 13 patients (31 %) with moderate splenomegaly (15-20 cm) and 6 of 45 patients (13 %) without (p < 0.001).

Moreover, these specialized compressors marginally improve the compression ratio over the best general-purpose compressors.

These were 95.8% (2033/2122), 85.4% (1813/2122), and 92.2% (1956/2122), respectively, with the external test dataset. In the comparative study, the accuracy for the manufacturer classification was 95.0% (152/160) for XCID and 91.3% for PPMnn (146/160), which was significantly higher than that for PID (80.0%,128/160; p < 0.001 for both). XCID demonstrated a higher accuracy (88.1%; 141/160) than PPMnn (80.0%; 128/160) in identifying model groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The remarkable and consistent performance of XCID suggests its applicability for detection, manufacturer and model identification, as well as MRI safety characterization of CIED on CRs. Further studies are warranted to guarantee the safe use of XCID in clinical practice.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Algorithm for the Detection and Characterization of MRI Safety of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices on Chest Radiographs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We developed the iTrainer (iT) as a portable laparoscopic trainer, which incorporates the iPad tablet. We then compared the iT with a standard pelvic trainer (SPT) to assess surgical skills as well as its image quality, resolution, brightness, comfort, and overall performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We designed and constructed the iT to be compatible with the Apple iPad 3 and standard laparoscopic instruments. Participants were assigned to perform the thread-the-loops task on both trainers and were prospectively randomized to start on either the iT or the SPT. Each participant was allowed a 2-minute warm-up before the 2-minute testing period. We scored participants using the product of skill quality (0-4 scale) and quantity of loops threaded (0-10 scale). Participants then rated each trainer on image quality, resolution, brightness, comfort, and overall performance on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS A total of 45 subjects including 10 undergraduates, 10 medical students, 10 general surgery and urology residents, and 15 experts (fellows and attending surgeons) participated in this study. There was no significant difference between thread-the-loops task scores completed on the iT when compared with the SPT for all groups tested (p > 0.05) with the exception of the medical student group, who performed better on the SPT (p < 0.05). On evaluation of each trainer, participants rated the iT as having superior image quality and resolution when compared with the SPT (p < 0.05) but rated the SPT higher in overall performance (p < 0.05). Brightness and comfort were rated similarly for both trainers. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated face validity and criterion validity for the thread-the-loops task on the iT. The iT rated superior in image quality and resolution but inferior in overall performance compared with the SPT. The iT provides trainees a unique advantage over SPT as an additional resource to laparoscopic training as it is inexpensive, portable, and can be readily available for training.","output":"Development of a novel iPad-based laparoscopic trainer and comparison with a standard laparoscopic trainer for basic laparoscopic skills testing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on the reactions of local experts in public health and health finance, this article traces the course of the pandemic in Nigeria, and discusses the measures taken to contain it, public compliance or non-compliance with those measures, and the inadequacy and underfunding of infection prevention methods.

We evaluated the feasibility and clinical utility of a novel MR imaging technique for regional perfusion imaging in this patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS Superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling with a circular labeling spot enabling selective vessel labeling was added to routine imaging in a prospective pilot study in 50 patients (10 women, 70.05  10.55 years of age) with extracranial steno-occlusive disease. Thirty-three had infarct lesions. DSC-MR imaging was performed in 16/50 (32%), and cerebral DSA, in 12/50 patients (24%). Vascular anatomy and the distribution of vessel stenoses and occlusions were defined on sonography and TOF-MRA. Stenoses were classified according to the NASCET criteria. Infarct lesions and perfusion deficits were defined on FLAIR and DSC-MR imaging, respectively. Individual perfusion patterns were defined on the superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps and were correlated with vascular anatomy and infarct lesion localization. RESULTS The superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling imaging sequence could be readily applied by trained technicians, and the additional scan time of 12.7 minutes was well-tolerated by patients. The detected vessel occlusions/stenoses and perfusion patterns corresponded between cerebral DSA and superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps in all cases. Perfusion deficits on DSC-CBF maps significantly correlated with those on superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps (Pearson r = 0.9593, P < .01). Individual collateral recruitment patterns were not predictable from the vascular anatomy in 71% of our patients. CONCLUSIONS Superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling is a robust technique for regional brain perfusion imaging, suitable for the noninvasive diagnostics of individual perfusion patterns in patients with complex cerebrovascular disease.","output":"MR Imaging of Individual Perfusion Reorganization Using Superselective Pseudocontinuous Arterial Spin-Labeling in Patients with Complex Extracranial Steno-Occlusive Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UK guidelines recommend that discussions about organ and tissue donation are conducted as part of end-of-life care.

It is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used, and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based Comparative Genome Sequencing service provided by Nimblegen Systems Inc., we resequenced the E. coli strain W3110 Kohara using MG1655 as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods. CGS detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences, one large deletion, and 9 of 12 IS element insertions present in W3110, but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion. In addition, we confirmed that CGS also detected 2 SNPs, one deletion and 7 IS element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the W3110 lambda clone library. The false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244 Kb of genome sequence. CONCLUSION: CGS is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another, and while highly cost-effective, is prone to certain errors. Mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected. It is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which SNPs were not called because they often indicate deletions or IS element insertions.","output":"An evaluation of Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) by comparing two previously-sequenced bacterial genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biochar is a low-cost adsorbent for sorptive removal of antibiotics from wastewater, but the adsorption efficiency needs to be improved. In this study, coconut-shell biochar was activated with KOH to improve the adsorption efficiency and magnetically modified with FeCl3 to enable recycling. The amount of KOH and the concentration of FeCl3 were optimized to reduce the pollution and production cost. The KOH-activated and FeCl3-magnetized biochar gave good sulfonamide antibiotic (SA) removal. The maximum adsorption capacities for sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole were 294.12, 400.00 and 454.55 mg g-1, respectively, i.e., five to seven times higher than those achieved with raw biochar. More than 80% of the adsorption capacity was retained after three consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. A combination of scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies, and magnetic hysteresis analysis showed that KOH activation increased the specific surface area, porosity, and number of oxygen-rich functional groups. Iron oxide particles, which were formed by FeCl3 magnetization, covered the biochar surface. The SAs were adsorbed on the modified biochar via hydrogen bonds between SA molecules and -OH/-COOH groups in the biochar. Investigation of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms showed that the adsorption process follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and a monolayer adsorption mechanism. The adsorption capacity at low pH was relatively high because of a combination of +- electron-donor-acceptor, charge-assisted hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and Lewis acid-base interactions, pore filling, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. The results of this study show that magnetically modified biochar has potential applications as an effective, recyclable adsorbent for antibiotic removal during wastewater treatment.","output":"Adsorption of Sulfonamides in Aqueous Solution on Reusable Coconut-Shell Biochar Modified by Alkaline Activation and Magnetization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, regulatory T cells have received increased attention for their role in immune responses to microbial infections. The list of microbial pathogens associated with regulatory T cell responses is growing rapidly and includes bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. As the biology of regulatory T cells is revealed, we are discovering that their induction during infection is a normal aspect of immunity, necessary to limit collateral damage from inflammatory responses and aggressive immunological effectors. Thus, these cells play a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between preventing immunopathology and allowing the immune response to clear infections. While generally successful, there are notable exceptions where regulatory T cell-mediated suppression appears to be responsible for allowing certain viruses to establish and maintain a persistent state. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of what virus-induced regulatory T cells are, how they are induced, and what mechanisms they use to suppress immunity.

Parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. In addition, we explored the incidence of femoral head necrosis in some of the individuals recovering from SARS. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in Beijing, China. They were tested regularly for serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody and lung function and were given chest X-rays and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examinations at the Chinese PLA General Hospital during the 12 months that followed their release from the hospital. Those individuals who were found to have lung diffusion abnormities (transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide [D(L)CO] < 80% of predicted value [pred]) received regular lung function tests and HRCT examinations in the follow-up phase in order to document the changes in their lung condition. Some patients who complained of joint pain were given magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of their femoral heads. FINDINGS: Of all the subjects, 81.2% (311 of 383 patients) tested positive for serum SARS-CoV IgG. Of those testing positive, 27.3% (85 of 311 patients) were suffering from lung diffusion abnormities (D(L)CO < 80% pred) and 21.5% (67 of 311 patients) exhibited lung fibrotic changes. In the 12 month duration of this study, all of the 40 patients with lung diffusion abnormities who were examined exhibited some improvement of lung function and fibrosis detected by radiography. Of the individuals receiving MRI examinations, 23.1% (18 of 78 patients) showed signs of femoral head necrosis. INTERPRETATION: The lack of sero-positive SARS-CoV in some individuals suggests that there may have been some misdiagnosed cases among the subjects included in this study. Of those testing positive, the serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody decreased significantly during the 12 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, we found that the individuals who had lung fibrosis showed some spontaneous recovery.

This has particularly been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, when researchers were not able to use traditional methods of recruitment. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of social media for recruiting a national sample. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the use of social media as a tool for recruiting a national sample of adults to a web-based survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between August and October 2020, participants were recruited through Facebook via two advertisement campaigns (paid option and no-cost option) into a web-based survey exploring the relationship between social determinants of health and well-being of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and Facebook metrics that were autogenerated by Facebook Ads Manager. Poststratification weights were calculated to match the Australian population on the basis of gender, age, and state or territory based on the 2016 Australian census data. RESULTS: In total, 9594 people were reached nationally with the paid option and potentially 902,000 people were reached through the no-cost option, resulting in a total of 1211 survey responses. The total cost of the advertisement campaign was Aus $649.66 (US $489.23), resulting in an overall cost per click of Aus $0.25 (US $0.19).

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous immunization with a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Convidecia) and a protein-subunit-based COVID-19 vaccine (ZF2001). Methods and Findings We did a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in healthy adults previously received one dose of Convidecia. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either ZF2001 (vaccine group) or a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (placebo group) at either 28-day or 56-day intervals. For both regimens, all participants received the 2nd injection with ZF2001 at 4 months after a dose of ZF2001 or TIV, with three-dose schedules of Convidecia/Convidecia/ZF2001 at day 0, day 28 and month 5 (referred to as CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5)) and CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6), and two-dose schedules of CV/ZF (D0-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M6). The primary outcome was the geometric mean titer (GMT) of the neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus 14 days after each boost vaccination. The safety outcome was 7-day reactogenicity, measured as solicited local or systemic adverse reactions after each vaccination. Between April 7, 2021, and May 6, 2021, 120 participants were enrolled, among whom 60 were randomly assigned to receive ZF2001 (n=40) or TIV (n=20) at a 28-day interval, and 60 were randomly assigned to receive ZF2001 (n=40) or TIV (n=20) at a 56-day interval. 113 (94.2%) participants received the 2nd injection with ZF2001 4 months after a dose of ZF2001 or TIV. A total of 26 participants (21.7%) reported solicited adverse events within 7 days post boost vaccinations, and all the reported adverse reactions were mild . Among participants receiving ZF001 as second dose, the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies increased to 58.4 IU/ml (42.8-79.8) in 0-28 regimen, and to 80.8 IU/ml (53.1-122.9) in 0-56 regimen at 14 days post first boost dose. The GMTs of neutralizing antibodies increased to 334.9 IU/ml (95% CI 230.4, 486.9) in C/Z/Z (D0-D28-M5) regimen, and 441.2 IU/ml (260.8, 746.4) in C/Z/Z (D0-D56-M6) regimen at 14 days after the third dose. Two-dose schedules of CV/ZF (D0-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M6) induced comparable antibody level comparable with that elicited by three-dose schedules, with the GMTs of 282.9 IU/ml (142.5, 561.8) and 293.9 IU/ml (137.6, 627.9), respectively. Study limitations include the absence of vaccine effectiveness in real-world, and current lack of immune persistence data and the neutralizing antibodies to Omicron. Conclusions Heterologous boosting with ZF001 following primary vaccination of Convidecia is safe and more immunogenic than a single dose of Convidecia.

There is debate on whether or not modern pig production systems meet all the needs of the animals. Pigs are able to perceive and feel and have mental capabilities that warrant attention to their welfare. The degree of on-farm animal welfare oversight varies around the world. Science is used to set animal welfare rules. However, science sometimes conflicts with cultural values (ex., religious slaughter). The focus of many animal welfare rules do not address the most significant problems on modern commercial pig farms. We believe that we should use science to determine the animal welfare needs of farm pigs but with a healthy respect for cultural differences in the ethics of animal care. We should also prevent economic neo-colonialism from forcing Western views on other cultures. ABSTRACT: Pigs are considered sentient beings that have a mental capability that warrants attention to their welfare. Cultural values towards animal welfare differ in world regions. Still, authors have argued for worldwide harmonization of animal welfare rules. At the same time, the focus of many animal welfare rules do not address the most significant problems on modern commercial pig farms. The foci of animal welfare rules are often on space (quantity and quality), acute painful practices, equipment, and caretaker behavior. However, most serious animal welfare issues are related to episodic events such as compromised pigs, lack of appropriately skilled staff, and human behavior (or lack thereof) towards animals. Modern technologies such as image, sound, and building oversight by automated systems can potentially provide better individual pig care. The future should bring us solutions to identify and resolve episodic negative animal welfare events. The other issues of space and painful practices are best improved by using science-based solutions. We propose that science be the key resource to making animal welfare decisions, but with a healthy appreciation and respect for cultural differences in our views of animals and the economic impact of rules. Colonialism is not viewed positively today, and economic neo-colonialism should not be allowed to replace it. Respect for cultural differences should play a role in animal welfare rules within and among countries.","output":"Animal Welfare and the Acknowledgment of Cultural Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. To better understand the epidemiology and relative effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated temporal changes in epidemiology related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019C2020 season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020-May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9), obese (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), or reside in a census tract with 40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8).

Results 463 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 397 were non-critically ill and 66 were critically ill (all from the intensive care unit). The LASSO regression identified four variables (hypersensitive cardiac troponin I, blood urea nitrogen , haemoglobin, and interleukin-6) contributing to the critical-ill events. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events associated with hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL (OR 20.98,95% CI 3.51-125.31), blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol/L (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.52-17.81, decreased haemoglobin (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and higher interleukin-6 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) on admission. Conclusions Hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were risk factors of critical-ill events in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Risk factors for critical-ill events of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: Host defence mechanisms to counter virus infection include the activation of the broncho-alveolar haemostasis. Fibrin degradation products secondary to extravascular fibrin breakdown could contribute to the marked increase in D-Dimers during COVID-19. We sought to examine the prognostic value on lung injury of D-Dimers in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients without thrombotic events. Methods: This study retrospectively analysed hospitalized COVID-19 patients classified according to a D-Dimers threshold following the COVID-19 associated haemostatic abnormalities (CAHA) classification at baseline and at peak (Stage 1: D-Dimers less than three-fold above normal; Stage 2: D-Dimers three- to six-fold above normal; Stage 3: D-Dimers six-fold above normal). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of critical lung injuries on chest computed tomography. The secondary outcome was the composite of in-hospital death or transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Among the 123 patients included, critical lung injuries were evidenced in 8 (11.9%) patients in Stage 1, 6 (20%) in Stage 2 and 15 (57.7%) in Stage 3 (p = 0.001). D-Dimers staging at peak was an independent predictor of critical lung injuries regardless of the inflammatory burden assessed by CRP levels (OR 2.70, 95% CI (1.50C4.86); p < 0.001) and was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death or ICU transfer (14.9 % in Stage 1, 50.0% in Stage 2 and 57.7% in Stage 3 (p < 0.001)). D-Dimers staging at peak was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or ICU transfer (OR 2.50, CI 95% (1.27C4.93); p = 0.008).

Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in COVID-19 patients is associated with high levels of cytokines and chemokines that cause multiple organ failure, systemic inflammation, and hemodynamic instabilities. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common complication of COVID-19, is a consequence of cytokine storm. In this regard, several drugs have been being investigated to suppress this inflammatory condition. Purinergic signaling receptors comprising of P1 adenosine and P2 purinoceptors play a critical role in inflammation. Therefore, activation or inhibition of some subtypes of these kinds of receptors is most likely to be beneficial to attenuate cytokine storm.

Some published studies have investigated the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the pandemic. However, the results vary widely. We aimed to systematically analyze and estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and attempted to reveal the reasons for prevalence variety in previous studies. METHODS: Published studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP Database), China National Knowledge database (CNKI), and the WanFang database from December 2019 to May 2021. The quality of all included studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist and the American Agency for Health Care Quality and Researchs (AHRQ) cross-sectional study quality evaluation items. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. RESULTS: Of the 1,708 references screened, 13 related reports that involve 41,729 participants were included. The results suggested that the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic was 28.6%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence was highest among the studies using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (46.8%) and lowest among these using Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) (11.4%). All studies using PHQ-9 set the cutoff at 5 points instead of 10. The pooled prevalence of studies that include primary school students was lower (16.5%) than that of studies excluding primary school students (39.1%).

We evaluated 6 ELISA assays including one confirmation assay to investigate antibody specificity. We also evaluated one point-of-care lateral flow device and one high throughput electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS The ELISA specificities ranged from 84-100%, with sensitivities ranging from 75.3-90.0%. The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity using smaller sample numbers. The Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. When used in conjunction, the Euroimmun nucleocapsid (NC) and spike-1 (S1) IgG ELISA assays had a sensitivity of 95.6%.

However, seroprevalence studies have been scarce in South East Asia including India, which, as of now, carries the third largest burden of confirmed cases in the world. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody among hospitalized patients at one of the largest government hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, recruited consecutive patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or CB-NAAT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels targeting recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS CoV-2 were estimated in serum samples by the ELISA method. Results: A total of 212 hospitalized patients were recruited in the study with mean age (+/-SD) of 41.2 (+/-15.4) years and 55% male population.

The neonatal immune system is generally held to be deficient in most compartments; responses to innate stimuli are weak, antigen-presenting cells have poor immunostimulatory activity and adaptive lymphocyte responses are limited, leading to poor immune memory and ineffective vaccine responses. For mucosal surfaces such as the lung, which is continuously exposed to airborne antigen and to potential pathogenic invasion, the ability to discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens is essential, to prevent inflammation that could lead to loss of gaseous exchange and damage to the developing lung tissue. We have only recently begun to define the differences in respiratory immunity in early life and its environmental and developmental influences. The innate immune system may be of relatively greater importance than the adaptive immune system in the neonatal and infant period than later in life, as it does not require specific antigenic experience. A better understanding of what constitutes protective innate immunity in the respiratory tract in this age group and the factors that influence its development should allow us to predict why certain infants are vulnerable to severe respiratory infections, design treatments to accelerate the development of protective immunity, and design age specific adjuvants to better boost immunity to infection in the lung.","output":"Innate Immunity to Respiratory Infection in Early Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of the study was to examine the level of generalized anxiety disorder among occupational and physical therapists during treatment sessions and its association with somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We tested whether the ratio of CO(2) elimination at the lung and the V-A ECMO (V?co(2ECMO)/V?co(2Lung)) would reflect the ratio of respective blood flows and could be used to estimate changes in pulmonary blood flow (Q?(Lung)), i.e., native cardiac output. Four healthy pigs were centrally cannulated for V-A ECMO. We measured blood flows with an ultrasonic flow probe. V?co(2ECMO) and V?co(2Lung) were calculated from sidestream capnographs under constant pulmonary ventilation during V-A ECMO weaning with changing sweep gas and/or V-A ECMO blood flow. If ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (V?/Q?) of V-A ECMO was not 1, the V?co(2ECMO) was normalized to V?/Q? = 1 (V?co(2ECMONorm)). Changes in pulmonary blood flow were calculated using the relationship between changes in CO(2) elimination and V-A ECMO blood flow (Q?(ECMO)). Q?(ECMO) correlated strongly with V?co(2ECMONorm) (r(2) 0.95C0.99). Q?(Lung) correlated well with V?co(2Lung) (r(2) 0.65C0.89, P < = 0.002).

Methods: Using an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results: We identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0, and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

HRCA has differentiated between safe and unsafe swallows, predicted components of the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile, and predicted kinematic events of swallowing such as hyoid bone displacement, laryngeal vestibular closure, and upper esophageal sphincter opening with a high degree of accuracy. However, HRCA has not been used to characterize swallow function in specific patient populations. This study investigated the ability of HRCA to differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that HRCA would differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases with a high degree of accuracy. We analyzed 170 swallows from 20 patients with neurodegenerative diseases and 170 swallows from 51 healthy age-matched adults who underwent concurrent video fluoroscopy with non-invasive neck sensors. We used a linear mixed model and several supervised machine learning classifiers that use HRCA signal features and a leave-one-out procedure to differentiate between swallows. Twenty-two HRCA signal features were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for predicting whether swallows were from healthy people or from patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Using the HRCA signal features alone, logistic regression and decision trees classified swallows between the two groups with 99% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 99% specificity. This provides preliminary research evidence that HRCA can differentiate swallow function between healthy and patient populations.","output":"A Preliminary Investigation of Whether HRCA Signals Can Differentiate Between Swallows from Healthy People and Swallows from People with Neurodegenerative Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, causing waves of the pandemic. Up to March 2022, eight million genome sequences have accumulated, which are classified into five major variants of concern. With the growing number of sequenced genomes, analysis of the big dataset has become increasingly challenging. Here we developed systematic approaches for comprehensive subtyping and pattern recognition for transmission dynamics. By analyzing the first two million viral genomes as of July 2021, we found that different subtypes of the same variant exhibited distinct temporal trajectories. For example, some Delta subtypes did not spread rapidly, while others did. We identified sets of characteristic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that appeared to enhance transmission or decrease efficacy of antibodies for some subtypes of the Delta and Alpha variants. We also identified a set of SNVs that appeared to suppress transmission or increase viral sensitivity to antibodies. These findings are later confirmed in an analysis of six million genomes as of December 2021. For the Omicron variant, the dominant type in the world, we identified the subtypes with enhanced and suppressed transmission in an analysis of seven million genomes as of January 2022 and further confirmed the findings in a later analysis of eight million genomes as of March 2022. While the \\"enhancer\\" SNVs exhibited an enriched presence on the spike protein, the \\"suppressor\\" SNVs are mainly elsewhere.

This report updates on these findings, to 15 January 2021, for a total of 272 reported cases of COVID-19 among CladT recipients. METHODS: Case definitions: confirmed (COVID-19 diagnostic test was positive); suspected (no confirmatory test performed/reported). Cases fulfilling the criteria of hospitalized, medically significant, or fatal were designated as serious and outcomes were classified per usual pharmacovigilance practice. RESULTS: The evaluable cohort comprised 261 patients (confirmed COVID-19, n=160; suspected, n=101); an additional 11 patients had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 but were not evaluated further given their negative diagnostic tests. Median time to onset of COVID-19 from the most recent preceding CladT treatment course was 162 days (n=139). Outcomes were: recovered/recovering, n=133 (51%); not recovered/not resolved, n=19 (7%); died, n=1 (0.4%); and not reported/missing/pending, n=108 (41%). Of the total cohort, 40 (15%) experienced serious COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CladT-treated patients with MS are generally not at greater risk of serious disease and/or a severe outcome with COVID-19 compared with the general population and other patients with MS who acquired COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with cladribine tablets: An update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of porcine submucosal allograft (Biodesign Sinonasal Repair Graft [Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN]) in oral cavity and oropharynx reconstruction after ablative surgery.

A total of 11 patients were included in the study. Data points included their perioperative medical and demographic data, immediate postoperative course, and follow-up visits at 10 days and at 2 months. The clinicopathologic characteristics of their disease, postoperative esthetic, and functional outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results: Eleven procedures have been performed, and all patients received Biodesign reconstruction either immediately after ablation or after they failed a previous reconstruction. None of the patients had bone exposure. The subsites included oral tongue (n = 6), floor of the mouth (n = 3), buccal mucosa (n = 1), and soft palate (n = 1). In all cases, the operations and the postoperative course were uneventful. The mean defect size was 22 cm2. The median start of oral intake was at 2 days postoperatively. The Biodesign graft healed well in all patients with no total graft loss. There was one complication that required revision surgery due to obstruction of Wharton's duct by the Biodesign material.

Protection conferred by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron re-infection, and the added value of vaccination, require quantification. ObjectiveTo estimate protection against Omicron re-infection and hospitalization conferred by prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 (non-Omicron) infection and/or up to three doses of (ancestral, Wuhan-like) mRNA vaccine. DesignTest-negative study between December 26 (epi-week 52), 2021 and March 12 (epi-week 10), 2022. SettingPopulation-based, province of Quebec, Canada ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling []12-year-olds tested for SARS-CoV-2. ExposuresPrior laboratory-confirmed infection with/without mRNA vaccination. OutcomesLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and hospitalization, presumed Omicron by genomic surveillance. The odds of prior non-Omicron infection with/without vaccination were compared among Omicron cases/hospitalizations versus test-negative controls (single randomly-selected per individual). Adjusted odds ratios controlled for age, sex, testing-indication and epi-week. Analyses were stratified by severity and time since last non-Omicron infection or vaccine dose. ResultsWithout vaccination, prior non-Omicron infection reduced the Omicron re-infection risk by 44% (95%CI:38-48), decreasing from 66% (95%CI:57-73) at 3-5 months to 35% (95%CI:21-47) at 9-11 months post-infection and <30% thereafter. The more severe the prior infection, the greater the risk reduction: 8% (95%CI:17-28), 43% (95%CI:37-49) and 68% (95%CI:51-80) for prior asymptomatic, symptomatic ambulatory or hospitalized infections. mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection was consistently significantly higher among previously-infected vs. non-infected individuals at 65% (95%CI:63-67) vs. 20% (95%CI:16-24) for one-dose; 68% (95%CI:67-70) vs. 42% (95%CI:41-44) for two doses; and 83% (95%CI:81-84) vs. 73% (95%CI:72-73) for three doses. Infection-induced protection against Omicron hospitalization was 81% (95%CI: 66-89) increasing to 86% (95%CI:77-99) with one, 94% (95%CI:91-96) with two and 97%(95%CI:94-99) with three mRNA vaccine doses. Two-dose effectiveness against hospitalization among previously-infected individuals did not wane across 11 months and did not significantly differ from three-dose effectiveness despite longer follow-up (median 158 and 27 days, respectively). Conclusions and relevancePrior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 infection provided substantial and sustained protection against Omicron hospitalization, greatest among those also vaccinated. In the context of program goals to prevent severe outcomes and preserve healthcare system capacity, >2 doses of ancestral Wuhan-like vaccine may be of marginal incremental value to previously-infected individuals.","output":"Protection against Omicron re-infection conferred by prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with and without mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a hybrid deep learning framework named CTNet which combines convolutional neural network and transformer together for the detection of COVID-19 via 3D chest CT images.

Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclnicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population. RESULTS: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84%) had solid tumors and 31 (16%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age &#8805; 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P < .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population.

RESULTS The cohort included 43 men (67%), 21 women (33%), and the median age was 66 years (range: 20-92). 36 (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to SARS-CoV-2. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurological manifestation, following by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from the other patients with abnormal brain imaging since the former had less frequently acute respiratory distress syndrome (p=0006) and more frequently corticospinal tract signs (p=002). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p=0007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p=0009). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients may develop a wide range of neurological symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications, such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis.

On one edge PRRSV has a predilection for immune cells and the disease manifestations can be linked directly to changes in the immune system. PRRSV appears to replicate extensively, if not exclusively, in cells of the immune lineage, notably macrophages; the direct replication of which may lead to immunosuppression, precipitate secondary infection and/or mediate disease. On the other edge, the virus stimulates immunity post-infection that protects an animal from re-infection. A vast array of structural and functionally distinct antibody specific to PRRSV are generated following infection or vaccination. Discrete populations of functional antibodies appear at different times and possibly reflect reactivity to different PRRSV polypeptides. Cell-mediated immune responses specific to PRRSV can be detected in various exposed pigs as well. Thus, the immune system appears to be intimately involved in both the disease process and protection from disease. It is unclear at this state of understanding what immune compartment provides protective immunity. Is it humoral (i.e. antibodies), selective functionally distinct populations of antibodies specific for selected PRRSV polypeptides or is cellular immunity essential for protection, or both.

This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. METHODS: This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in AprilaJuly 2020. RESULTS: Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3-8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12-19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8-17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.","output":"Asynchrony Between Individual and Government Actions Accounts for Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a review of the literature on key matters related to the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes, indirect health and social impacts, and key risk factors in migrants. METHODS: Our systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135) identified peer-reviewed and grey literature relating to migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 HICs. Primary outcomes were cases, hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 involving migrants; secondary outcomes were indirect health and social impacts and risk factors. RESULTS: 3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis. We found migrants are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are over-represented among cases (e.g. constituting 42% of cases in Norway [to 27/4/2020], 26% in Denmark [to 7/9/2020], and 32% in Sweden [to 7/5/2020]); some datasets from Europe show migrants may be over-represented in deaths with increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected, with certain nationality groups disproportionately impacted. Migrants experience a range of risk factors for COVID-19, including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement. CONCLUSIONS: Migrants in HICs are at high risk of COVID-19, with a range of specific risk factors that have not been well-considered in the public health response to date. These data are of immediate relevance to the policy response to the pandemic, with strategies urgently needed to reduce transmission. Migrant populations must also be better considered in national plans for COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. On behalf of ESGITM KEY MESSAGES: Migrants in high-income countries may be disproportionately represented in COVID-19 infections and deaths, with higher levels of many vulnerabilities and risk factors.

User-friendly Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) implementation tools and supervision systems are needed to strengthen the quality of child health services in South Africa. A 2018 pilot implementation of electronic IMCI case management algorithms in KwaZulu-Natal demonstrated good uptake and acceptance at primary care clinics. We aimed to investigate whether ongoing electronic IMCI implementation is feasible within the existing Department of Health infrastructure and resources. METHODS: In a mixed methods descriptive study, the electronic IMCI (eIMCI) implementation was extended to 22 health facilities in uMgungundlovu district from November 2019 to February 2021. Training, mentoring, supervision and IT support were provided by a dedicated project team. Programme use was tracked, quarterly assessments of the service delivery platform were undertaken and in-depth interviews were conducted with facility managers. RESULTS: From December 2019 C January 2021, 9 684 eIMCI records were completed across 20 facilities, with a median uptake of 29 records per clinic per month and a mean (range) proportion of child consultations using eIMCI of 15% (1C46%). The local COVID-19-related movement restrictions and epidemic peaks coincided with declines in the monthly eIMCI uptake. Substantial inter- and intra-facility variations in use were observed, with the use being positively associated with the allocation of an eIMCI trained nurse (p < 0.001) and the clinician workload (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: The ongoing eIMCI uptake was sporadic and the implementation undermined by barriers such as low post-training deployment of nurses; poor capacity in the DoH for IT support; and COVID-19-related disruptions in service delivery. Scaling eIMCI in South Africa would rely on resolving these challenges.","output":"The feasibility and ongoing use of electronic decision support to strengthen the implementation of IMCI in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) urged a never\\\\seen coordinated global response to prepare the health system, including primary care, hospital facilities and intensive care units (ICUs).

However, the relationship of initial BT to stroke severity and degree of benefit from thrombolytic therapy has been delineated incompletely. METHODS We analyzed the public data set of the 2 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) stroke trials, comparing patients with lower (<37.0C) and higher (37.0C) presenting BT. RESULTS Among 595 patients (297 placebo and 298 tPA treated) with documented initial BT, 77.1% had initial BT <37.0C and 22.9% 37.0C. Patients with higher initial BT had lower baseline stroke severity in both tPA-treated patients (the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale median, 11 versus 15; P=0.05) and placebo-treated patients (median, 13 versus 16; P<0.01). Patients with higher initial BT also had lower infarction volume on computed tomography at 3 months in both tPA-treated patients (median, 9.6 versus 16.7 cm(3); P=0.08) and placebo-treated patients (median, 13.1 versus 28.1 cm(3); P=0.02), but no clinical outcome differences. Analysis of lytic treatment effect found no heterogeneity in the degree of tPA benefit in both higher and lower BT groups (37.0C: odds ratio for the modified Rankin Scale 0-1 outcome, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-6.21 and <37.0C: odds ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-3.84; heterogeneity P=0.83).

Due to its rapid proliferation, it has garnered growing attention. The technique proposed in this chapter seeks to produce unconstrained generic actions in the video. Conventional anomaly detection is difficult because computationally expensive characteristics cannot be employed directly, owing to the necessity for real-time processing. Even before activities are completely seen, they must be located and classified. This paper proposes an expanded Mask R-CNN (Ex-Mask R-CNN) architecture that overcomes these issues. High accuracy is achieved by using robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based features. The technique consists of two steps. First, a video surveillance algorithm is employed to determine whether or not a human is wearing a mask. Second, Multi-CNN forecasts the frame's suspicious conventional abnormality of people. Experiments on tough datasets indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online traditional detection of anomaly systems while maintaining the real-time efficiency of existing classifiers.","output":"A novel algorithm for mask detection and recognizing actions of human"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statement from the Chair and Co-chair of the ERS Early Career Member Committee (ECMC) and introduction to the new members of this committee https://bit.ly/3ltuWX9","output":"Statement from the Early Career Member Committee (ECMC) Chair and Co-chair and introduction of the new ECMC members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to mental health problems worldwide.

DESIGN Systematic review. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Articles of interest included a lifestyle/behavioral intervention targeting weight gain prevention. Eligibility criteria included the following: study design of randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized control trials, or natural experiments; average participant age between 18 and 35 years; study duration of at least 12 months; and published in English between January 2008 and May 2018. Studies had to report weight or body mass index as a measured outcome and were excluded if they were paired with smoking cessation programs, were conducted in specific groups (ie, pregnant women, breast cancer survivors), or were follow-ups to weight loss studies. STUDY SELECTION After removing duplicates, the search yielded 11 426 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened by 1 reviewer; 144 articles were assessed in a full-text review by 2 reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Nine studies (13 articles) were included in the review. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S) Reported elements of the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS A total of 9 studies met the selection criteria. All studies lacked full reporting on external validity elements. Of the total of 60 RE-AIM reporting criteria, 8 were reported by all 9 studies, 26 criteria were reported by fewer than 4 studies, and 22 criteria were not reported by any of the studies.

Although classically associated with bacterial and viral agents, fungal species have also been suspected to affect the course of the disease. Candida tropicalis is an opportunistic fungus that affects immunocompromised individuals and is also able to spread to vital organs. As C. tropicalis has been increasingly isolated from systemic infections, we aimed to evaluate the effect of this fungus on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model to study MS. For this, EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice 3 days after infection with 10(6) viable C. tropicalis yeasts. The infection decreased EAE prevalence and severity, confirmed by the less inflammatory infiltrate and less demyelization in the lumbar spinal cord. Despite this, C. tropicalis infection associated with EAE results in the death of some animals and increased urea and creatinine serum levels. The kidneys of EAE-infected mice showed higher fungal load associated with increased leukocyte infiltration (CD45(+) cells) and higher expression of T-box transcription factor (Tbx21) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Altogether, our results demonstrate that although C. tropicalis infection reduces the prevalence and severity of EAE, partially due to the sequestration of leukocytes by the inflamed renal tissue, this effect is associated with a poor disease outcome.","output":"Candida tropicalis Systemic Infection Redirects Leukocyte Infiltration to the Kidneys Attenuating Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy.

However, non-religious spiritual schools have various shortcomings, the most important of which are temporary, devoid of truth, contradictions and one-dimensionality. Hence, the present study investigated the relationship between spiritual intelligence and spiritual health of Muslim medical students of Penang, Kuala Lumpur and in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, 1000 medical students were selected as the statistical population by simple sampling method and standard questionnaires were used to collect data. Data analysis confirmed a positive and significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and spiritual health amongst medical students ( r = 0.78, p = 0.00) by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Moreover, results indicated the benefit of Islamic teachings with the spirituality required by human beings. Modern human life, with its significant advances in the material areas, has not been successful in paying attention to spirituality and thus neglected it. Therefore, various mental diseases are caused by material domination in the lives of todays people that are devoid of spirituality. Furthermore, the emergence of various secular spiritual schools verifies that Western societies, in particular, after the failure of the church, are one of the reasons for the emergence of such false spiritualties. With regard to the unity of spirituality and religion, therefore, spirituality cannot be separated from religion in different ways.

The small a30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in a9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Between March 2020 and May 2020, patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU were enrolled in this study. Upon discharge, patients were telephoned and asked to complete a survey related to taste and smell impairment. Characteristics were compared between patients with and without taste and/or smell impairment. RESULTS Fifty-two patients were enrolled (mean age, 61.32  12.53 years; mean ICU stay, 10.19  10.24 days). Age, sex, type/number of comorbid diseases, most ICU support modalities, and ICU stay duration did not significantly differ between groups. Patients in group B required more high-flow nasal oxygen therapy than patients in group A (P = .010). In total, 22 (42.3%) of 52 patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment. Three patients experienced isolated smell impairment and one patient experienced isolated taste impairment. Among the 21 patients who experienced smell impairment, 18 (85.78%) experienced hyposmia (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score: 6.33  0.97), while 3 (14.28%) experienced anosmia. Among the 19 patients who experienced taste impairment, 16 (84.22%) experienced hypogeusia (mean VAS score: 6.43  1.03) and 3 (15.78%) experienced ageuisa. Among 22 patients who experienced taste and/or smell impairment, 15 (68.18%) patients (n = 15/22) experienced smell and/or taste impairment before the ICU stay, while 7 (31.82%) patients (n = 7/22) experienced impairment during the ICU stay. Overall, 28.84% (n = 15/52) of the patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment before the ICU stay.

The field of PrEP delivery for young people is relatively nascent and lessons about potential PrEP adherence interventions could be learned from the larger evidence base of adherence interventions for other daily medications among youth. DESIGN: Systematic review of adherence support interventions for adolescents. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO through January 2020 for oral contraceptive pill (OCP), antiretroviral therapy (ART), asthma, and diabetes medication adherence interventions. We reviewed primary articles about OCP adherence interventions and reviewed systematic reviews for ART, asthma, and diabetes medication adherence interventions. Studies were retained if they included participants ages 10C24 years; measured OCP, ART, asthma, or diabetes medication adherence; and were systematic reviews, randomized trials, or quasi-experimental studies. RESULTS: Fifteen OCP articles and 26 ART, diabetes, and asthma systematic reviews were included. Interventions that improved medication adherence for OCPs, ART, asthma, and diabetes treatment included reminder text messages, computer-based and phone-based support, and enhanced counseling. Multi-month prescriptions and same-day pill starts also were found to improve OCP adherence and continuation. Adolescent-friendly clinics and peer-based counseling significantly improved ART adherence, and telemedicine interventions improved diabetes medication adherence.

Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice. This is the first study to identify inflammation-induced hemolysis in mouse models of sepsis using Raman spectral signatures for hemoglobin.

Based upon a broad range of research findings, a particular societal benefit emanating from higher education relates to good citizenship: that it leads to more open mindedness and tolerant political attitudes. We examined these issues using a representative sample of students from Israeli universities to clarify the extent to which these outcomes would be paralleled in the Israeli setting, where the university experience differs markedly from that found typically in the West. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a comparison of political tolerance levels between first- and final-year students enrolled in regular undergraduate study programs (of four days a week or more). However since a change in tolerance is likely to be contingent also on the amount of time that the student spends on campus during the study year, we introduce, as a control group, students enrolled in compressed study programs (of three days a week or less) and compare changes in their tolerance levels with tolerance changes of students enrolled in regular programs. Research questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students at three universities from the three major districts in IsraelCnorth, south and center. The achieved sample size was 329 students. Findings: Using Difference-in-Differences techniques, we looked for any changes in students' general political tolerance, over the course of their studies. Surprisingly, we found no such effect on political tolerance attitudes. Israeli students are older and often married and though nominally full-time students, they often hold down a full-time job. Thus they come and go to attend lectures but do not otherwise spend much time on campus. Given the somewhat perfunctory nature of the university experience for most Israeli students, it does not to lead to more open-minded and tolerant political attitudes. Practical implications: Some broader, practical applications of the research, beyond the Israeli case, are presented, particularly related to distance learning and to the impact of COVID-19. Attention is given to more recent Cancel culture developments on university campuses. Originality/value: The results have wider implications, to other university setting in other countries. Changes in political attitudes may occur in university settings where campus life is well developed, with opportunities for student interaction, formally in extra-curricular events or through social mixing outside the lecture hall. Where the university experience is more minimally confined to attendance at lectures these desirable outcomes may not be forth coming. These findings are relevant to other university frameworks where campus attendance is marginal, such as in open university education and, even more explicitly, in purely internet-based higher education study. ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Does university attendance impact students' political tolerance and open-mindedness: the atypical case of Israel?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Democratically immature EU member states continue to act like mere guests in the European club, taking minimum responsibility for upholding EU rules and exercising little power in Union affairs","output":"Together or Apart?

METHODS: We performed a prospective study of patients admitted to three adult ICUs of our hospital from December 2010 to February 2011. All tracheal aspirate (TA) samples sent to the microbiology department were systematically screened for influenza. We defined influenza as unsuspected if testing was not requested and the patient was not receiving empirical antiviral therapy after sample collection. RESULTS: We received TA samples from 105 patients. Influenza was detected in 31 patients and was classified as unsuspected in 15 (48.4%) patients, and as hospital acquired in 13 (42%) patients. Suspected and unsuspected cases were compared, and significant differences were found for age (53 versus 69 median years), severe respiratory failure (68.8% versus 20%), surgery (6.3% versus 60%), median days of ICU stay before diagnosis (1 versus 4), nosocomial infection (18.8% versus 66.7%), cough (93.8% versus 53.3%), localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (6.3% versus 40%), median days to antiviral treatment (2 versus 9), pneumonia (93.8% versus 53.3%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (75% versus 26.7%).

METHODS: The data of Chinese Longitudinal and Health Longevity Study in 2012 and 2014 wave was used for baseline data. Mortality was assessed in the subsequent 2018 survey waves. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality related to vitamin D change, including maintaining deficiency or no deficiency, deficiency to no deficiency, and no deficiency to deficiency, using below 50 nmol/L as definition of deficiency. RESULTS: The mean age of the total 1362 participants was 84.4  12.1(60C113) years. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 67.5% and 68.4% in 2012 and 2014 wave respectively, and significantly differed by sex and age at baseline. Cox regression showed that participants with deficiency to no deficiency and maintaining no deficiency of vitamin D status had decreased HR for all-cause mortality, compared to the maintaining deficiency group.

These are of particular concern as evident from the recent global pandemic due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The genus Ebolavirus belongs to the Filoviridae family and its members are known to cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a highly contagious disease with a mortality rate of approximately 90%. The similarity of the clinical symptoms to those of various tropical ailments poses a high risk of misdiagnosis. Diagnostic strategies currently utilized include real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, amongst others. No specific treatment exists at present, and the management of patients is aimed at the treatment of complications augmented with supportive clinical care. The recent outbreak of EVD in West Africa, which began in 2014, led to accelerated development of vaccines and treatment.

US data showed a 70% enrollment reduction in April and a 38% reduction in July 2020, compared to prepandemic rates. We implemented processes during the initial phase of the pandemic to minimize participant and staff viral exposure, develop remote procedures, and ease communication barriers, while still maintaining enrollment goals. Methods: Our stroke research team developed multiple processes to help mitigate pandemic effects on our enrollment. We developed watchlists for eligible and interested patients who could not be enrolled due to national and local restrictions. As research staff was unable to approach patients in person, phone and email scripts were developed to ensure information was disseminated in a consistent fashion. Remote and alternate consent methods were implemented. We tracked the evolving national and local guideline changes, and began re-opening trials on May 23, 2020. We implemented a rotating pool of coordinators, including a site-specific sanitation plan, once it was safe to be on campus in-person. In person meetings were moved to a virtual platform. Enrollment data across for 10 active subacute stroke studies, each active over the 3 years of, 2018-2020, was analyzed for the months from March to June, with 2020 individually compared to 2018 and 2019 via the Student T-Test. Results: Total enrollment during these 4 months were 15 participants in 2018, 11 in 2019, and 15 in 2020, with no statistical difference between the years. No study patients nor staff contracted symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: Enrollment shows no significant changes despite COVID-19. New processes allowedthe timely reopening of clinical trials, an overall maintenance of enrollment rates, including a non-significant increase in 2020 compared to previous years.

METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. An online survey questionnaire was completed by ophthalmology residents from different parts of the country. The survey consisted of questions related to the impact of the pandemic on training, innovative training techniques adapted during the pandemic and their effectiveness, and COVID-19 duty-related information. RESULTS: A total of 147 responses were obtained. The mean age was 29.3 years (range: 24C40 years, SD: 3.82). Of which, 87 (59.2%) respondents were females. A total of 61 (41.5%) respondents reported practicing steps of ocular surgeries on goat eye, 69 (46.9%) on model eye/vegetables/fruits, 30 (20.4%) on surgical simulators, and 26 (17.7%) utilized 3-D virtual images and videos. In addition, 22 (15%) respondents reported never using any such techniques. Furthermore, 130 (88.4%) respondents reported practicing steps of cataract surgery, 52 (35.4%) practiced steps of open globe repair, and steps of trabeculectomy were reported by 24 (16.3%).

The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. While there have been ample studies describing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, relatively few have established an empirical link between these disparities and structural racism. Such empirical analyses are critically important to help defuse \\"victim-blaming\\" narratives about why minority communities have been badly hit by COVID-19. In this paper, we explore the empirical link between structural racism and disparities in county-level COVID-19 outcomes by county racial composition. Using negative binomial regression models, we examine how five measures of county-level residential segregation and racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes as well as incarceration rates are associated with county-level COVID-19 outcomes. We find significant associations between higher levels of measured structural racism and higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, even after adjusting for county-level population sociodemographic characteristics, measures of population health, access to healthcare, population density, and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. One percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.1% increase in county case rate. This association decreased to 0.4% when structural racism indicators were included in our model. Similarly, one percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.8% increase in county death rates, which became non-significant after adjustment for structural racism. Our findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that structural racism is an important driver of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and reinforce existing calls for action to address structural racism as a fundamental cause of health disparities.","output":"Structural Racism and COVID-19 in the USA: a County-Level Empirical Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The party autonomy doctrine represents a very central component of international commerce.

We find that no single policy can effectively suppress the epidemic, and the most effective policy is a hybrid policy with lockdown and broadening testing. Lockdown policy alone is ineffective in controlling the epidemic as agents would have optimally stayed at home anyway if the infection risk is high even without a lockdown. Broadening testing solely will accelerate the return to normal life as there are fewer infected people hanging around. However, as people do not internalize the social costs of returning to normal life, the epidemic could get even worse. Increasing medical capacity without any other measures only has temporary effects on reducing the death toll.

No studies examined the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between challenge stress and health illness. This study attempted to investigate the relationships between these three variables among Chinese college students. Especially, this study focused on examining whether self-efficacy moderated the effect of perceived challenge stress on students' mental health. Also, the differences were tested between male and female students in terms of these three variables. A sample of 578 Chinese college students was recruited over an approximately 12-week period from 7 Chinese universities. An online survey link was distributed through WeChat. The SPSS version 26 software was used to analyze the data. Results showed that there is no significant difference between genders in terms of perceived challenge stress, self-efficacy, and students' mental health. In addition, challenge stress was positively related to the students' mental health (beta = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01) while there was a negative association between self-efficacy and mental health (beta = -0.41, p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, self-efficacy plays a moderating role in the relationship between challenge stress and mental health (beta = -0.11, p = 0.02). Students with low self-efficacy tend to experience more mental health issues. It is suggested that Chinese colleges and universities pay more attention to students with low self-efficacy, either through faculty/staff interventions or peer counseling.

Methodology: An online survey was conducted using Survey monkey platform (R). A survey link which was sent through the WhatsApp platform (R) to the MBBS/BDS students across the country. The survey questionnaire evaluated the views about the various aspects of the online classes. Results: A total of 1059 students completed the survey, of which 1033 entries were analyzed. The participants' mean age was 20.8 years with nearly equal male-to-female ratio, majority being MBBS students who were taking part in online classes mostly from home (95.4%), by using smart phones (85%). When asked to compare the experience of online classes with regular in-person classes, a majority of the participants reported having poor attention and concentration, poor retention of knowledge, poor learning of theoretical aspects of subject, poor learning of practical aspects of the subject, poor questions/answers sessions, and only 38.9% and 10.6% rated online theory and online practical classes as 'good' or 'very good,' respectively. The most common advantages of online classes reported by the students were that they do not have to travel (69%) and do not have to dress up (69.9%), while the most commonly reported disadvantages included poor learning of practical aspects (75%), followed by strain on eyes (73.4%) and difficulties with internet connectivity (64.8%). A small proportion of students 'occasionally' or more often indulged in surfing Internet, Chatting on WhatsApp/Telegram/FB Messenger, and using Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, We Chat, Snap Chat, and Telegram) while attending online classes. Conclusions: This study suggests that although various colleges are running online classes, as a substitute for the regular in person classes in view of the need for social distancing, these classes are not well received by the students and are possibly does not fulfilling the desired needs of the students.

The purpose of this study was to assess the level of compliance with the infection prevention and control practices among HCWs in different healthcare settings and its relationship with their views on workplace infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Nurses in Hong Kong were invited to respond to a cross-sectional online survey, in which their views on workplace infection and prevention policy, compliance with standard precautions and self-reported health during pandemics were collected. Results: The respondents were dissatisfied with workplace infection and prevention policy in terms of comprehensiveness (62%), clarity (64%), timeliness (63%), and transparency (60%). For the protective behavior, the respondents did not fully comply with the standard precautions when they were involved in medical care. Their compliance was relatively low when having proper patient handling (54%) and performing invasive procedures (46%). A multivariate analysis model proved that the level of compliance of the standard precautions was positively associated with the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy among high risk group (0.020; 95% CI: 0.005C0.036), while older respondents had higher level of compliance among the inpatient and outpatient groups (coefficient range: 0.065C0.076).

Secondary objectives were to determine if there was a change in infection and complication profile with changes introduced in practice. METHODS: This UK-based multicentre retrospective national audit studied foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13 January and 31 July 2020, examining time periods pre-UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23 March to 11 May 2020), and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period were included. A total of 43 centres in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland participated. Variables recorded included demographic data, surgical data, comorbidity data, COVID-19 and mortality rates, complications, and infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 6,644 patients were included. Of the operated patients, 0.52% (n = 35) contracted COVID-19. The overall all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 0.41%, however in patients who contracted COVID-19, the mortality rate was 25.71% (n = 9); this was significantly higher for patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery (75%, n = 3 deaths). Matching for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and comorbidities, the odds ratio of mortality with COVID-19 infection was 11.71 (95% confidence interval 1.55 to 88.74; p = 0.017). There were no differences in surgical complications or infection rates prior to or after lockdown, and among patients with and without COVID-19 infection. After lockdown the COVID-19 infection rate was 0.15% and no patient died of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was rare in foot and ankle patients even at the peak of lockdown.

The prediction and forecasting of the number of infected people (so-called confirmed cases) is a critical issue that helps in understanding the fast spread of COVID-19. Therefore, in this article, we present an improved version of the ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) model to forecast the number of infected people in four countries, Italy, Iran, Korea, and the USA. The improved version of ANFIS is based on a new nature-inspired optimizer, called the marine predators algorithm (MPA). The MPA is utilized to optimize the ANFIS parameters, enhancing its forecasting performance. Official datasets of the four countries are used to evaluate the proposed MPA-ANFIS. Moreover, we compare MPA-ANFIS to several previous methods to evaluate its forecasting performance. Overall, the outcomes show that MPA-ANFIS outperforms all compared methods in almost all performance measures, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), and Coefficient of Determination([Formula: see text]).

However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities and bottom-up approaches used within COVID-19 responses thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation within the COVID-19 response. METHODOLOGY: A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndromeand H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language. RESULTS: From 1112 references identified, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria, which detail 37 initiatives. Six main community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These worked on different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. CONCLUSION: COVID-19s global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and to support equity-informed responses. Aligning previous community engagement experience with current COVID-19 community-based strategy recommendations highlights how communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures and use community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.","output":"Community engagement for COVID-19 prevention and control: a rapid evidence synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the strong social distancing measures adopted by governments around the world provide an ideal scenario to evaluate the trade-off between lives saved and morbidity avoided on the one hand and reduced economic resources on the other. We adapt the standard model of willingness to pay (WTP) for mortality/morbidity risk reductions by incorporating a number of aspects that are highly relevant during an epidemic; namely, health-care capacity constraints, dynamic aspects of prevention (i.e., interventions aimed at flattening the epidemic curve), and distributional issues due to high heterogeneity in the underlying risks. The calibration of the model generates a WTP of the order of 24% of GDP. We conclude that the benefits in terms of lives saved and morbidity avoided can well justify the enormous economic costs generated by social distancing interventions. There is, however, significant that heterogeneity in WTP estimates depending on the degree of vulnerability to infection risk (e.g., by age), implying a large redistribution of income and well-being.","output":"Willingness to pay for morbidity and mortality risk reductions during an epidemic.

AIM: (1) To evaluate the expression of TREM-1 in patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias compared to healthy individuals; and (2) to analyze the levels of these biomarkers according to disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar. Studies were considered eligible if they were observational studies that provided data on the levels of TREM-1 in humans with viral pneumonia compared to healthy controls. The results of the meta-analysis were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and an effect size of 0.8 was considered a large effect. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the disease severity. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in this systematic review. Four studies included patients with COVID-19 and three analyzed patients with different viruses. The meta-analysis was performed only with patients with COVID-19, which showed increased levels of soluble form of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) among patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls (SMD 1.53; 95% CI 0.53C2.52; p < 0.01). No differences were found between patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and healthy controls, but higher levels of sTREM-1 were shown among patients with severe COVID-19 (SMD 1.83; 95% CI 0.77C2.88; p < 0.01). All three studies including patients with other viral pneumonias showed that TREM-1 levels were significantly elevated in infected patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide evidence on the pro-inflammatory role of TREM-1 in these infections, contributing to the inflammatory profile and disease progression.

However, primary care providers (PCPs) may prefer treating patients with medication. A secondary exploratory analysis of a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate psychological vs. pharmacological treatment preferences among PCPs. Thirty-four health facilities, including 205 PCPs, participated in the study, with PCPs in 17 facilities assigned to a standard version of the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training delivered by mental health specialists. PCPs in the other 17 facilities received mhGAP instruction delivered by specialists and people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE), using a training strategy entitled Reducing Stigma among HealthcAre ProvidErs (RESHAPE). Pre- and post- intervention attitudes were measured through quantitative and qualitative tools. Qualitative interviews with 49 participants revealed that PCPs in both arms endorsed counselings benefits and collaboration within the health system to provide counseling. In the RESHAPE arm, PCPs were more likely to increase endorsement of statements such as depression improves without medication (F = 9.83, p < 0.001), not all people with depression must be treated with antidepressants ((2) = 17.62, p < 0.001), and providing counseling to people who have alcohol abuse problems is effective ((2) = 26.20, p < 0.001). These mixed-method secondary findings from a pilot trial suggest that in-person participation of PWLE in training PCPs may not only reduce stigma but also increase PCPs support of psychological interventions.

This study uses data from the COVID-19 International Student Well-Being Study, which collected data through a non-representative convenience sample in 125 higher-education institutions (HEI) across 26 high- and middle-income countries (N: 20,103) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes the prevalence of depressive symptoms in higher-education students. We find substantial cross-national variation in depressive symptoms, with lowest mean levels established in the Nordic countries and France, while highest mean levels of depressive symptoms were found in Turkey, South Africa, Spain and the USA. Elevated risk for depressive symptoms was found in female students, students with fewer social support resources and in a more disadvantaged socioeconomic position, and students with a migrant background. COVID-19 related stressors, such as reduced social contact, increased financial insecurity, and academic stress explained a relatively larger proportion of the variance in depressive symptoms compared to non-COVID-19 related stressors. This finding shows that not the pandemic itself, but rather the secondary effects of the pandemic relate to students' mental health.

The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.","output":"Laboratory diagnosis of emerging human coronavirus infections - the state of the art"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social, geographic, economic, demographic, and health factors were analysed to identify some social determinants related to case fatality of COVID-19 in 67 countries.

Since its beginning, several epidemiological models have been developed to investigate the specific dynamics of the disease. Early COVID-19 epidemiological models were purely statistical, based on a curve-fitting approach, and did not include causal knowledge about the disease. Yet, these models had predictive capacity; thus they were used to ground important political decisions, in virtue of the understanding of the dynamics of the pandemic that they offered. This raises a philosophical question about how purely statistical models can yield understanding, and if so, what the relationship between prediction and understanding in these models is. Drawing on the model that was developed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, we argue that early epidemiological models yielded a modality of understanding that we call descriptive understanding, which contrasts with the so-called explanatory understanding which is assumed to be the main form of scientific understanding. We spell out the exact details of how descriptive understanding works, and efficiently yields understanding of the phenomena.

Severe disease is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), use of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and prolonged hospitalization, The role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease is still unclear, which imposes limitations on identifying potential immunotherapy that can improve care for acute and chronic phases of COVID-19 in conjunction with current therapies. Research efforts are ongoing for more than 1 year to identify key immunological mechanisms involved in the disease process. While insightful, this knowledge is still incomplete and can be complemented with the assessment of immune response kinetics. Such assessment will help with the identification of early interventional modalities of immune cell regulation. With these considerations in mind, we aimed to assess several parameters of immune system regulation during the current medical care of patients with COVID-19. Methods: This is a pre-clinical prospective cohort study which involved laboratory-based assessments of blood samples obtained from COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. The study population was divided into three cohorts. Our first cohort included 18 years and older COVID-19 patients with respiratory complaints, oxygen (O2) saturations of less than or equal to 92 and pulmonary infiltrates on an imaging study or who were critically ill and required ventilatory support. Second cohort included 18 years and older COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized and did not require ventilatory support. Third cohort included participants with no prior diagnosis of COVID-19, or any recent viral respiratory symptoms including fever, cough or shortness of breath for the last 2 weeks. Patients with an established diagnosis of cancer or immunologic disorders were excluded. Blood specimens were collected over the period of hospitalization: specimen number 1 on day 1-3 of hospitalization, specimen number 2 on days 3-4 of hospitalization, specimen number 3 on days 5-7 of hospitalization, and specimen number 4 on 7-30 days after discharge. We performed capillary electrophoresis for serology and automated ELISA for cytokine measurement. We collected clinical data on patient demographic, clinical characteristics such as presence of any acute and chronic comorbidities and serum inflammatory markers C-Reactive Protein, D-Dimer and Ferritin. Results: We had 15 patients in cohort 1, 10 in cohort 2 and 15 in cohort 3. Patients in cohort 1 were older and had higher comorbidities. Males constituted a substantially high percentage of patients in cohort 1 and 2 (60% and 70% respectively). Patients had similar BMI in cohort 1 and 2. Total antibody levels were highest in cohort 1 but an upward trend over the course of hospitalization was noted in all cohorts. Most interesting pattern was noted in the context of antibodies against spike protein S1 receptor-binding domain (S1RBD) where patients in cohort 2 developed minimal S1RBD antibodies. Cohort 1 on average had higher levels of Interleukin 6(IL-6), Interleukin 8(IL-8), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and other inflammatory cytokines except Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) compared to Cohort 2. Remarkable difference in CXCL-10 levels was noted between the groups and healthy volunteers had the lowest levels. No significant difference in IFN-gamma was noted between cohorts and the levels quickly depleted over the course of the infection. Conclusion: Our analysis confirms that neutralizing antibodies do not correlate with lessened COVID-19 disease severity. Severe COVID-19 infection is secondary to ineffective innate immunity associated with immune overshoot. CXCL10 serves as a major component in triggering the cytokine storm that is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our findings show an association between high levels of CXCL10 and more severe COVID-19 infection. There does not seem to be any significant correlation with disease severity and IFN-gamma levels.

At the same time, we calculated the risk of COVID-19 death. RESULTS: During the study period, 961894 cases and 35913 deaths were reported in Peru. Men had a twofold higher risk of COVID-19 death within the overall population of Peru (odds ratio (OR), 2.11; confidence interval (CI) 95%; 2.06C2.16; p<0.00001), as well as 20 regions of Peru, compared to women (p<0.05). There were variations in incidence, mortality and fatality rates stratified by sex, age, and region. The incidence rate was higher among men than among women (3079 vs. 2819 per 100,000 habitants, respectively). The mortality rate was two times higher in males than in females (153 vs. 68 per 100,000 habitants, respectively).

In addition, we examined the associations between mother's marital satisfaction and perception of the infant on the one hand, and the two aspects of meaning in life on the other, investigating whether these variables mediate the link between research group and meaning in life. The results indicate that mothers reported significantly higher perception of infant's warmth and presence of meaning before than during the pandemic. Furthermore, they displayed greater marital satisfaction and more search for meaning during the pandemic than prior to it. For the whole sample, higher marital satisfaction and perception of infant's warmth were related to higher presence of meaning, and lower marital satisfaction and perception of the infant's invasiveness were related to higher search for meaning. Finally, mother's marital satisfaction and perception of the infant fully mediated the relationship between the research group and the two aspects of meaning in life.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Tests for the etiological agent identify genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 or humoral responses to it. The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract materials during the first week of symptoms. Serological tests should be indicated from the second week of symptoms onwards. A wide range of different tests is available, with variable sensitivity and specificity, most of which require validation. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, clotting tests, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and procalcitonin identify risk of disease with greater severity, thromboembolic complications, myocardial damage, and/or worse prognosis. Imaging tests may be useful for diagnosis, especially when there is a compatible clinical picture, and other tests presented negative results or were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genetic material of the virus by RT-PCR is the gold standard test, but its sensitivity is not satisfactory. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on clinical data, epidemiological history, tests for etiological diagnosis, and tests to support the diagnosis of the disease and/or its complications.

In this study we aimed to compare the 6-month mortality of patients receiving VV-ECMO support for COVID-19 with a historical viral ARDS cohort. Fifty-three consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS admitted for VV-ECMO to the Royal Brompton Hospital between 17/03/2020 and 30/05/2020 were identified. Mortality, patient characteristics, complications and ECMO parameters were then compared to a historical cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia.

The HeartLogic algorithm identifies patients at risk of heart failure events, combining multiple sensors available on implantable cardioverter defibrillators. This analysis examined how multiple CIED sensors behave in periods of anticipated restrictions pertaining to physical activity. We demonstrated a significant drop in median activity level immediately after the implementation of stay-at-home orders, whereas there was no difference in the other contributing sensors. The weekly rate of heart failure alerts was significantly higher during the lockdown and post-lockdown than that reported in the pre-lockdown. ABSTRACT: Aims: The utilization of remote monitoring platforms was recommended amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The HeartLogic index combines multiple implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) sensors and has proved to be a predictor of impending heart failure (HF) decompensation. We examined how multiple ICD sensors behave in the periods of anticipated restrictions pertaining to physical activity. Methods: The HeartLogic feature was active in 349 ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD patients at 20 Italian centers. The period from 1 January to 19 July 2020, was divided into three phases: pre-lockdown (weeks 1C11), lockdown (weeks 12C20), post-lockdown (weeks 21C29). Results: Immediately after the implementation of stay-at-home orders (week 12), we observed a significant drop in median activity level whereas there was no difference in the other contributing parameters. The median composite HeartLogic index increased at the end of the Lockdown. The weekly rate of alerts was significantly higher during the lockdown (1.56 alerts/week/100 pts, 95%CI: 1.15C2.06; IRR = 1.71, p = 0.014) and post-lockdown (1.37 alerts/week/100 pts, 95%CI: 0.99C1.84; IRR = 1.50, p = 0.072) than that reported in pre-lockdown (0.91 alerts/week/100 pts, 95%CI: 0.64C1.27). However, the median duration of alert state and the maximum index value did not change among phases, as well as the proportion of alerts followed by clinical actions at the centers and the proportion of alerts fully managed remotely. Conclusions: During the lockdown, the system detected a significant drop in the median activity level and generated a higher rate of alerts suggestive of worsening of the HF status.","output":"Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Multisensor Monitoring during Home Confinement Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global pandemic and understandably, Obstetrics is not spared. Private maternity hospitals have a unique challenge of reassuring unaffected patients of uneventful delivery with the lowest possible rate of coronavirus infection while consequently offering compassionate and state of art services to women who turn out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. This has led to a routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of all patients before admission in many of the private hospitals in India. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-COV-2 among asymptomatic pregnant women and to ascertain the utility of universal screening in these women. Methodology: A retrospective observational multi-center study was conducted over a period of approximately 5 months (1-May-2020 to 10-September-2020) in a chain of privately run maternity hospitals with presence in multiple cities across India. All asymptomatic pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to elective/emergency hospital admission. Results: Among 4158 women tested, 54 (1.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and intra partum and postnatal period was uneventful for all of them.

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coinfections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them.

DESIGN: This descriptive qualitative inquiry followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of 15 frontline nurses who were dispatched to the outbreak epicentre from March to April 2020. Verbatim transcripts were content analysed. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data: inadequate preparedness for working with full gear personal protective equipment, full gear personal protective equipment stimulated stress responses, coping strategies and professional growth. Participants learned a great deal from problem-focussed and emotion-focussed strategies to tackle challenges related to the prolonged wearing of full gear personal protective equipment for quality nursing care and reduced risk of exposure.

Although several mechanisms have been proposed including oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism is still unknown. Few studies have investigated the mechanism linking PM2.5 and blood pressure (BP). In this study, we measured urinary metabolites and BP -related renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to investigate the associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and BP in healthy C57BL/6 mice. METHODS The C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambient concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 16 weeks. Systolic BP and diastolic BP were measured by noninvasive BP system. The urine metabolites were quantified using the untargeted metabolomics approach. The expression of RAAS-related proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang (1-7) and aldosterone (ALD) were measured using Western blot and ELISA kits. RESULTS The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure induced significant changes of some metabolites in urine, including stress hormones, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. Furthermore, there was an elevation of BP, increase of serous Ang II and ALD, along with the decrease of ACE2 and Ang (1-7) in kidney in the PM2.5-exposed mice compared with FA-exposed mice. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure-induced BP elevation might be associated with RAAS activation. Meanwhile, PM2.5 exposure-induced changes of stress hormone and lipid metabolism might mediate the activation of RAAS.

High frequencies of S-binding germinal centre B cells and plasmablasts were sustained in these draining lymph nodes for at least 12 weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding monoclonal antibodies derived from germinal centre B cells predominantly targeted the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, and fewer clones bound to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1.

METHODS: Variables, including median overall survival (OS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, primary diagnosis, and date of diagnosis, were retrieved from TriNetX, a real-world database. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were applied to assess significance of differences in survival. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values were calculated. All patient data were deidentified. RESULTS: A total of 227,255 patients with BM were identified in the TriNetX database; median OS was 12.3 months from initial cancer diagnosis and 7.1 months from development of BM. OS of BM from nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were 8.7, 14.7, 17.8, and 15.6 months, respectively. After matching patient baseline characteristics, OS of cohorts with or without exposure to ICIs was evaluated. For all types of cancer, median OS durations for the ICI and no-ICI cohorts were 14.0 and 7.9 months, respectively (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85C0.91). More specifically, OS was remarkably prolonged in patients with NSCLC (14.4 vs. 8.2 months; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82C0.90), TNBC (23.9 vs. 11.6 months; HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.82C0.92), and melanoma (27.6 vs. 16.8 months; HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73C0.88) if patients had exposure to ICIs. In contrast, there was no significant difference in OS of patients with RCC treated with and without ICIs (16.7 vs. 14.0 months; HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.86C1.10).

The proposed sensor was modeled on the basis of the total internal reflection (TIR) technique for real-time detection of ligand-analyte immobilization in the sensing region. The refractive index (RI) of the sensing region is changed due to the interaction of different concentrations of the ligand-analyte, thus impacting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excitation of the multi-layer sensor interface. The performance of the proposed sensor was numerically investigated by using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The proposed SPR biosensor provides fast and accurate early-stage diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus, which is crucial in limiting the spread of the pandemic. In addition, the performance of the proposed sensor was investigated numerically with different ligand-analytes: (i) the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as ligand and the COVID-19 virus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as analyte, (ii) the virus spike RBD as ligand and the virus anti-spike protein (IgM, IgG) as analyte and (iii) the specific probe as ligand and the COVID-19 virus single-standard ribonucleic acid (RNA) as analyte. After the investigation, the sensitivity of the proposed sensor was found to provide 183.33/refractive index unit (RIU) in SPR angle ((SPR)) and 833.33THz/RIU in SPR frequency (SPRF) for detection of the COVID-19 virus spike RBD; the sensitivity obtained 153.85/RIU in SPR angle and 726.50THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of the anti-spike protein, and finally, the sensitivity obtained 140.35/RIU in SPR angle and 500THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of viral RNA. It was observed that whole virus spike RBD detection sensitivity is higher than that of the other two detection processes. Highly sensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials were used to achieve significant enhancement in the Goos-H?nchen (GH) shift detection sensitivity and plasmonic properties of the conventional SPR sensor. The proposed sensor successfully senses the COVID-19 virus and offers additional (1 + 0.55)  L times sensitivity owing to the added graphene layers. Besides, the performance of the proposed sensor was analyzed based on detection accuracy (DA), the figure of merit (FOM), signal-noise ratio (SNR), and quality factor (QF). Based on its performance analysis, it is expected that the proposed sensor may reduce lengthy procedures, false positive results, and clinical costs, compared to traditional sensors. The performance of the proposed sensor model was checked using the TMM algorithm and validated by the FDTD technique.","output":"Design and Numerical Analysis of a Graphene-Coated SPR Biosensor for Rapid Detection of the Novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT.-: An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed. OBJECTIVE.-: To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES.-: A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non-peer-reviewed preprints. CONCLUSIONS.-: Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements, were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, or COVID-19 Severity Score, may be used to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited because of the study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.","output":"Predicting Disease Severity and Outcome in COVID-19 Patients: A Review of Multiple Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated, highly lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Currently, no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available. Studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent FCoV isolates. Since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing FIP and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon- (IFN-) production, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the feline IFN- gene (fIFNG) are associated with the outcome of infection. A total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 FIP cats were analyzed, and 16 SNP were identified in intron 1 of fIFNG. Among these SNP, the fFING + 428 T allele was shown to be a FIP-resistant allele (p = 0.03), and the heterozygous genotypes 01C/T and +408C/T were found to be FIP-susceptible factors (p = 0.004). Furthermore, an fIFNG + 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of IFN- in FIP cats. For the identification of these three FIP-related SNP, genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing. The identification of additional FIP-related SNP will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to FIP.","output":"Identification and genotyping of feline infectious peritonitis-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the feline interferon- gene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spite of renewed attention for practices in tourism studies, the analysis of practices is often isolated from theories of practice This theoretical paper identifies the main strands of practice theory and their relevance and application to tourism research, and develops a new approach to applying practice theory in the study of tourism participation We propose a conceptual model of tourism practices based on the work of Collins (2004), which emphasises the role of rituals in generating emotional responses This integrated approach can focus on individuals interacting in groups, as well as explaining why people join and leave specific practices Charting the shifting of individuals between practices could help to illuminate the dynamics and complexity of tourism systems","output":"A new approach to understanding tourism practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A free software tool from the US Environmental Protection Agency was put through its paces at a midsize water utility and bolstered the utility's water quality event-detection capabilities.","output":"CANARY Eases Water Quality Event Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to determine the levels of death anxiety and death-related depression in the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 can be diagnosed using RT-PCR, but inadequate access to reagents, equipment, and a nonspecific target has slowed disease detection and management. Precision medicine, individualized patient care, requires suitable diagnostics approaches to tackle the challenging aspects of viral outbreaks where many tests are needed in a rapid and deployable approach. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies such as proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have been applied in disease outbreaks for identification of infectious disease agents such as virus and bacteria and the molecular phenomena associated with pathogenesis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) is widely used in clinical diagnostics in the United States and Europe for bacterial pathogen identification. Paper spray ionization mass spectrometry (PSI-MS), a rapid ambient MS technique, has recently open a new opportunity for future clinical investigation to diagnose pathogens. Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLCCHRMS)-based metabolomics and lipidomics have been employed in large-scale biomedical research to discriminate infectious pathogens and uncover biomarkers associated with pathogenesis. PCR-MS has emerged as a new technology with the capability to directly identify known pathogens from the clinical specimens and the potential to identify genetic evidence of undiscovered pathogens. Moreover, miniaturized MS offers possible applications with relatively fast, highly sensitive, and potentially portable ways to analyze for viral compounds. However, beneficial aspects of these rapidly growing MS technologies in pandemics like COVID-19 outbreaks has been limited.

To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Multicenter. Subjects and Methods. Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified. Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed. Infection control strategies implemented for ENT outpatients and emergency room visits at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reported. Results. Median age was 63 years, 55% were male, and 95% were in severe or critical condition. Six tracheotomies were performed. Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized). Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus. At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control. PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints. No inpatient ENT providers were infected. After implementation of infection control strategies for outpatient clinics, emergency visits, and surgeries, no providers were infected at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University.

In all the selected 12 countries, Wave 2 had a much higher number of confirmed cases than that in Wave 1. However, the death cases increase was not comparable with that of the confirmed cases to the extent that some countries had lower death cases than in Wave 1, UAE, and Spain.

It is, however, unknown whether the BAB angle also influences the incidence of angiographically negative perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (PMSAH). OBJECTIVE We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study comparing the BAB angle in a series of patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery (BSAH) with the BAB angle in a series of patients who presented with PMSAH. METHODS Consecutive patients who presented to our institution with PMSAH or BSAH between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 were studied. Patients with PMSAH were further subdivided into patients with classic PMSAH (CPMSAH) and those with nonclassic PMSAH (NCPMSAH) based on initial head computed tomography examinations. In each patient, the BAB angle was measured on the standard cranial anteroposterior projections after vertebral artery injections. RESULTS A total of 21 patients with CPMSAH, 30 patients with NCPMSAH, and 31 patients with BSAH were studied. The BAB angle was significantly smaller in patients with CPMSAH (87.7  17.1 degrees) and NCPMSAH (98.4  21.1 degrees) compared with patients with BSAH (135.0  30.8 degrees) (P < .001).

This includes a majority of undocumented cases of COVID-19, which were classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document and glean insights from the experiences of individuals with a first-hand experience in dealing with COVID-19, especially the so-called mild-to-moderate cases that self-resolved while in isolation. METHODS: This web-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States and had tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods, including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, as well as through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured in this study included knowledge of contraction or transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on the road to recovery. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants (female, n=53; male, n=19; age range: 18-73 years; mean age: 41 [SD 14] years) from 22 US states were enrolled in this study. The top known source of how people contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19, was through a family or household member (26/72, 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (13/72, 18%). Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness, such as brain or memory fog, palpitations, ear pain or discomfort, and neurological problems. In addition, 47 of 72 (65%) participants reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-week period even for mild cases of COVID-19. The mean recovery time of the study participants was 4.5 weeks, and exactly one-half of participants (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65 days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 (51%) participants reported that they experienced stigma associated with contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings suggesting that emphasis on family or household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and that there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of illness with the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from COVID-19 survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected by the virus, and guide further research.","output":"Learning From the Experiences of COVID-19 Survivors: Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It has been 17 years since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and Singapore is facing yet another daunting pandemic C the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). To date, there are 57,607 cases and 27 casualties. This deadly pandemic requires significant changes especially in the field of awake surgeries for intra-axial tumors that routinely involve long clinic consults, significant interactions between patient and multiple other team members pre, intra, and postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all awake cases done during the COVID-19 pandemic from February to June 2020 was done. In this article, we outline the rigorous measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic that has allowed us to proceed with awake surgeries and intraoperative mapping at our institution. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have divided the protocol into various phases of care of patients planned for an awake craniotomy. Preoperatively, teleconsults have been used where possible thereby limiting multiple hospital visits and interaction. Intraoperatively, safety nets have been established during asleep-awake-asleep phases of awake craniotomy for all the team members. Postoperatively, early discharge and teleconsult are being employed for rehabilitation and follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple studies have shown that with intraoperative mapping, we can improve neurological outcomes. As the future of the pandemic remains unknown, the authors believe that surgical treatment should not be delayed for intracranial tumors. Awake craniotomies and intraoperative mapping can be safely carried out by adopting the described protocols with combination of multiple checkpoints and usage of telecommunication.","output":"Performing Awake Surgeries in Times of COVID-19 C A Singapore Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an important basis of navigation safety decisions, ship domains have always been a pilot concern.

The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. RESULTS: Between 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (na=a40) and control (na=a40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (Pa=a1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RT-PCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (Pa>a0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, larger randomized clinical trials including more parameters are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of SOF/VEL.","output":"Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus the standard of care in adults hospitalized with COVID-19: a single-centre, randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CO2 emissions from aviation have been predicted to increase over the coming decades.

Those few examples that exist in the research literature are generally directed towards management and are less applicable to universities, given the large autonomy researchers enjoy and their discretionary control of research project funds. This paper uses a design-oriented research approach to present an analysis of the problem space at the intersection of interactive visualizations using air travel data to reduce CO2 emissions from business air travel at our own university, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Through a number of design experiments, evaluations and investigations, we have unearthed needs, challenges and opportunities for the creation of visualization tools to support more sustainable travel practices at universities and in other knowledge-intensive organisations.","output":"Exploring the Problem Space of CO2 Emission Reductions from Academic Flying"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transition to web-based learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to consider the benefits of and the risks associated with web-based technology for education, media use, and access to resources.

The Internet of Things, in particular, enables massive amounts of data to be generated more quickly. The Internet of Things is a term that describes the process of connecting computers, smart devices, and other data-generating equipment to a network and transmitting data. As a result, data is produced and updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in all areas and activities. As a consequence of this exponential growth of data, a new term and idea known as big data have been coined. Big data is required to illuminate the relationships between things, forecast future trends, and provide more information to decision-makers. The major problem at present, however, is how to effectively collect and evaluate massive amounts of diverse and complicated data. In some sectors or applications, machine learning models are the most frequently utilized methods for interpreting and analyzing data and obtaining important information. On their own, traditional machine learning methods are unable to successfully handle large data problems. This article gives an introduction to Spark architecture as a platform that machine learning methods may utilize to address issues regarding the design and execution of large data systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened the profound insecurity of large segments of the UK population, an insecurity itself the product of a decade of austerity policies. Increased unemployment, reduced hours, and enforced self-isolation for multiple vulnerable groups is likely to lead to an increase in UK food insecurity, exacerbating diet-related health inequalities. The social and economic crisis associated with the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the system of food charity which, at present, is a key response to growing poverty. A vulnerable food system, with just-in-time supply chains, has been challenged by stockpiling. Resultant food supply issues at food banks, alongside rapidly increasing demand and reduced volunteer numbers, has undermined many food charities, especially independent food banks. In the light of this analysis, we make a series of recommendations. We call for an immediate end to the five week wait for Universal Credit and cash grants for low income households. We ask central and local government to recognise that many food aid providers are already at capacity and unable to adopt additional responsibilities. The governments - significant - response to the economic crisis associated with COVID-19 has underscored a key principle: it is the governments responsibility to protect population health, to guarantee household incomes, and to safeguard the economy. Millions of households were in poverty before the pandemic, and millions more will be so unless the government continues to protect household incomes through policy change.","output":"How COVID-19 has exposed inequalities in the UK food system: The case of UK food and poverty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all sectors of society including higher education. Students report a desire to resume in-person learning but safety and flexibility are paramount to achieve this instructional modality. Flipping the classroom is a teaching approach that promotes independent learning outside of class with activity-based exercises within the classroom. Benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student engagement, course flexibility, and enhanced learning. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the utility of flipping the classroom on learning physiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized undergraduate Human Physiology students (n = 124) during the fall 2020 semester. Course content was provided as asynchronous online lectures with 3 ? 5 new videos released weekly. Students independently viewed the lectures outside of class and completed a synchronous weekly online quiz before a weekly in-person lecture recitation with masks and social distancing. Lecture recitations (50 min) were designed to review, reinforce and practice lecture material?they were generally structured as follows: 1) review most difficult concepts from recent lectures;2) answer questions collected via collaborative online document;3) complete/discuss practice questions via iClicker;and 4) complete/discuss mini-case studies or real-world scenarios. Sessions were recorded for asynchronous viewing. To supplement lecture, students also completed 3 traditional wet labs and 3 virtual labs (ADInstruments). At the conclusion of the semester, students were offered extra credit (&lt;1% course total) to complete a survey regarding their experience with the flipped classroom environment and perceived barriers to academic success. Student demographics: 71% were female, 52% were nursing majors and 50% were sophomores. Students felt that the flipped classroom design fit well into their schedules (87%) and they learned a lot of material (85%) that was applicable to their lives (90%) and future careers (94%). Students agreed that their questions were answered during lecture recitation (66%), the sessions helped them understand difficult material (70%), and they benefited from the in-person practice (71%). The majority (68%) stated that lecture recitations improved their physiology education. Despite these positive responses, 60% of students still reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted their physiology education. Top barriers to educational success included increased stress (77%), working more (52%), lack of motivation (45%), increased family obligations (44%), and feeling overwhelmed (39%). In addition, 20% of students reported contracting COVID-19 and 42% had to self-isolate due to exposure.

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the predictive values and the most powerful predictive combinations of single aEEG and NIRS parameters and the respective cut-off values with regard to short-term outcomes in HIE II. METHODS aEEG and NIRS were prospectively studied at the Medical University of Vienna in the first 102 h of life with regard to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-two neonates diagnosed with HIE II treated with hypothermia were investigated. The measurement period was divided into 6-h epochs. According to MRI, 2 outcome groups were defined and predictive values of aEEG parameters, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), and the additional value of both methods combined were studied. Receiver operating curves (ROC) were obtained and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated. ROC were then used to detect the optimal cut-off points, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. RESULTS At all time epochs, combined parameter scores were more predictive than single parameter scores. The highest AUC were observed between 18 and 60 h of cooling for the aEEG summation score (0.72-0.84) and for (background pattern + seizures)  rScO2 (0.79-0.85). At 42-60 h sensitivity was similar between those 2 scores (87.5-90.0%), but the addition of NIRS to aEEG led to an increase in specificity (from 52.4-59.1% to 72.7-90.5%).

Exploring their experiences and views on what could be improved, and those of carers and healthcare staff, is key to developing better services. AIMS: We aimed to synthesise the relevant qualitative literature. METHOD: Five databases were searched. Eligible studies included service users with a diagnosis of personality disorder and their carers or relevant staff, focused on crisis responses and used a qualitative design. Data were analysed with thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, most focusing on emergency departments. Four meta-themes emerged: (a) acceptance and rejection when presenting to crisis care: limited options and lack of involvement of carers; (b) interpersonal processes: importance of the therapeutic relationship and establishing a framework for treatment; (c) managing recovery from a crisis: clear recovery plan and negotiating collaboration; and (d) equipping and supporting staff: training and emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emergency departments have major limitations as settings to provide crisis care for people with complex emotional needs, but there is a lack of research exploring alternatives. The quality of the therapeutic relationship was central to how care was experienced, with collaborative and optimistic staff highly valued. Staff reported feeling poorly supported in responding to the needs of this population.

We will leverage methods from behavioral economics, which involves understanding the many factors that influence human decision making, to inform strategy development. METHODS: We will identify key mechanisms that limit implementation of evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health through contextual inquiry involving behavioral health and primary care clinicians. Second, we will use contextual inquiry results to systematically design a menu of behavioral economics-informed implementation strategies that cut across settings, in collaboration with an advisory board composed of key stakeholders (i.e., behavioral economists, clinicians, implementation scientists, and suicide prevention experts). Finally, we will conduct rapid-cycle trials to test and refine the menu of implementation strategies. Primary outcomes include clinician-reported feasibility and acceptability of the implementation strategies. DISCUSSION: Findings will elucidate ways to address common and unique barriers to evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health care.

A serological survey was done at some of these locations to assess the COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Mdecins Sans Frontires in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test. Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms. FINDINGS: Between June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites. Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site ((2) p<00001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (887%, 95% CI 818C932), followed by emergency shelters (505%, 463C547), and food distribution sites (278%, 208C357). More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 642C722; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.

BACKGROUND: Contaminated environmental surfaces have been associated with outbreaks of healthcare-associated illness (HAIs). One in every 20 patients in U.S. acute care hospitals acquire a healthcare-associated illness, leading to consequences such as elevated morbidity, mortality, and a decrease in quality of life. In the patient environment, MRSA can remain viable from hours to up to 14 days. METHODS: Environmental surface materials were evaluated as new and worn. Material composition and properties were assessed to evaluate surface integrity and the influence on the disinfection of MRSA. Inoculated materials were used to assess MRSA viability over time and the efficacy of a manufacturers recommended cleaning and disinfection product compared to a novel disinfectant. RESULTS: Environmental surface materials respond differently in appearance and roughness, when mechanically worn. When measuring MRSA survival, at 24 hr, MRSA colony forming unit (CFU) counts were reduced on the copper sheet surface and solid surface with cupric oxide. By 72 hr, all MRSA counts were zero. Bleach and the novel disinfectant were equally effective at disinfecting MRSA from all surface types.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the pandemic, many have posited that virtual visits will endure even as in-person visits are reinstated. The public's perception of telemedicine for an initial surgical consultation has not been previously studied. METHODS: A 43-question survey assessed respondents' attitudes toward telemedicine for initial consultations with surgeons, both in the context of COVID-19 and during \\"normal circumstances.\\" Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing marketplace. RESULTS: Based on 1827 analyzable responses, we found that a majority (86%) of respondents reported being satisfied (either extremely or somewhat) with telemedicine encounters. Interestingly, preference for in-person versus virtual surgical consultation reflected access to care, with preference for telemedicine decreasing from 72% to 33% when COVID-related social distancing ends. Preferences for virtual visits decreased with increasing complexity of the surgical intervention, even during the pandemic. A majority felt that \\"establishing trust and comfort\\" was best accomplished in person, and the vast majority felt it was important to meet their surgeons prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The public views telemedicine as an acceptable substitute for in-person visits, especially during the pandemic. However, it appears that an in-person interaction is still preferred when possible for surgical consultations.

Histopathological findings typically include mesangial hypercellularity with IgM and complement deposition, though the spectrum may range from normal glomeruli through to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Thromboembolism is a well recognised complication of nephrotic syndrome, but cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION This is the case of a 23-year-old male presenting with the nephrotic syndrome, whose initial renal biopsy was consistent with minimal change disease. Complete remission was achieved with prednisone, however multiple relapses and steroid dependence prompted re-biopsy, the results of which were more consistent with IgM nephropathy. His last relapse was complicated by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. He then received rituximab and a weaning course of prednisone to again enter remission. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need to consider IgM nephropathy in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.

COVID-19-induced respiratory distress syndrome is a predictable severe complication that requires early diagnosis and proper treatment. Given the pathogenetic mechanism of lung damage in COVID-19, surfactant replacement therapy may be useful in the treatment of this cohort of patients. Clinical case. A clinical case of severe coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a 6-month-old child is presented. The course of the disease was accompanied by severe damage to the lung parenchyma with the development of acute respiratory distress. The examination of the patient confirmed the genetic determinism of severe COVID-19, polymorphic risk alleles of the genes GSTM1, GSTP1, SFTP-B. The child's treatment included not only long-term mechanical ventilation, but also surfactant replacement therapy. The child recovered and was discharged without signs of respiratory failure. Conclusions. This clinical case demonstrates the association of genetic polymorphism with severe virus-induced lung damage. Because severe respiratory failure in COVID-19 is likely to be due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, administration of exogenous surfactant should be considered as a possible treatment option.

The comparative effectiveness and safety among PCC products are not fully understood. METHODS: Patients in an academic level one trauma center who received PCC3 or PCC4 for EWR were identified. Patient characteristics, PCC dose and time of dose, pre- and post-INR and time of measurement, fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K doses, and patient outcomes were collected. Patients whose pre-PCC International Normalized Ratio (INR) was > 6 h before PCC dose or the pre-post PCC INR was > 12 h were excluded. The primary outcome was achieving an INR &#8804; 1.5 post PCC. Secondary outcomes were the change in INR over time, post PCC INR, thromboembolic events (TE), and death during hospital stay. Logistic regression modelled the primary outcome with and without a propensity score adjustment accounting for age, sex, actual body weight, dose, initial INR value, and time between INR measurements. Data are reported as median (IQR) or n (%) with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Eighty patients were included (PCC3 = 57, PCC4 = 23). More PCC4 patients achieved goal INR (87.0% vs. 31.6%, odds ratio (OR) = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.80-54.93, p < 0.001). This result remained true after adjusting for possible confounders (AOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 2.17-51.24, p < 0.001). The post-PCC INR was lower in the PCC4 group (1.3 (1.3-1.5) vs. 1.7 (1.5-2.0)).

DESIGN: NOR-Solidarity is an independent, add-on, randomized controlled trial to the WHO Solidarity trial that included biobanking and 3 months of clinical follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04321616) SETTING: 23 hospitals in Norway. PATIENTS: Eligible patients were adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Between 28 March and 4 October 2020, a total of 185 patients were randomly assigned and 181 were included in the full analysis set. Patients received remdesivir (n = 42), HCQ (n = 52), or standard of care (SoC) (n = 87). MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the primary end point of WHO Solidarity, study-specific outcomes were viral clearance in oropharyngeal specimens, the degree of respiratory failure, and inflammatory variables. RESULTS: No significant differences were seen between treatment groups in mortality during hospitalization. There was a marked decrease in SARS-CoV-2 load in the oropharynx during the first week overall, with similar decreases and 10-day viral loads among the remdesivir, HCQ, and SoC groups. Remdesivir and HCQ did not affect the degree of respiratory failure or inflammatory variables in plasma or serum. The lack of antiviral effect was not associated with symptom duration, level of viral load, degree of inflammation, or presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at hospital admittance.

Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Sweden's progress toward the WHO elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. METHODS: The data used for modeling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources, and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios (\\"2019 Base\\" and \\"WHO Targets\\") were developed to evaluate Sweden's progress toward HCV elimination. RESULTS: At the beginning of 2019, there were 29,700 (95% UI: 19,300 - 33,700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment, and liver-related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require 1) expanding harm reduction programs to reach more than 90% of PWID and 2) treating 90% of HCV+ PWID engaged in harm reduction programs and &#8805;7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programs, annually by 2025.

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS: Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS: Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3).

Falls with injuries are the main cause of accidental death in the elderly population, representing a relevant public health problem. Balance disorder is a major risk factor for falling and represents one of the most frequent reasons for health care demand. The use of information and communication technologies to support distance healthcare (eHealth) represents an opportunity to improve the access and quality of health care services for the elderly. In recent years, several studies have addressed the potential of eHealth devices to assess the balance and risk of falling of elderly people. Remote rehabilitation has also been explored. However, the clinical applicability of these digital solutions for elderly people with balance disorders remains to be studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to guide the clinical applicability of eHealth devices in providing the screening, assessment, and treatment of elderly people with balance disorders, but without neurological disease. METHODS: A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement. Data were obtained through searching the PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and SciELO databases. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiexperimental studies (QESs) published between January 2015 and December 2019 were included. The quality of the evidence to respond to the research question was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal for RCTs and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for QESs. RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We provide a narrative synthesis of the main outcomes from the included studies. RESULTS: Among 1030 unduplicated articles retrieved, 21 articles were included in this review. Twelve studies explored different technology devices to obtain data about balance and risk of falling. Nine studies focused on different types of balance exercise training. A wide range of clinical tests, functional scales, classifications of faller participants, sensor-based tasks, intervention protocols, and follow-up times were used. Only one study described the clinical conditions of the participants. Instrumental tests of the inner ear were neither used as the gold-standard test nor performed in pre and postrehabilitation assessments. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth has potential for providing additional health care to elderly people with balance disorder and risk of falling. In the included literature, the heterogeneity of populations under study, methodologies, eHealth devices, and time of follow-up did not allow for clear comparison to guide proper clinical applicability. This suggests that more rigorous studies are needed.","output":"eHealth for Addressing Balance Disorders in the Elderly: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with hardships for patients and their care partners.

Early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients is crucial. We aimed to derive and validate a simple score for the prediction of severe outcomes. A retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was carried out by the Italian Society of Internal Medicine. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables were collected at hospital admission at five hospitals. Three algorithm selection models were used to construct a predictive risk score: backward Selection, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Random Forest. Severe outcome was defined as the composite of need for non-invasive ventilation, need for orotracheal intubation, or death. A total of 610 patients were included in the analysis, 313 had a severe outcome. The subset for the derivation analysis included 335 patients, the subset for the validation analysis 275 patients.

Bimodal size-distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. Bimodal distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K during DDP. The bimodal size distribution of K was found common for other events because of biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP indicated mixed sources from biomass burning and fireworks.

Following a year of circulation of SARS-CoV-2 through the world, epidemiological dynamics allow a test of this hypothesis. A dynamic epidemiological model was fitted to the Covid-19 attributed excess deaths in South Africa, a country with a long-standing BCG vaccination program and where social-economic circumstances potentially result in frequent exposure to common cold coronaviruses. We show that Covid-19 propagation dynamics in South Africa are consistent with an initially fully susceptible population (no prior cross-immunity protecting against infection), but this requires assuming values of the infection fatality rate (IFR) below or at the lower plausible range (0.31 to 0.53) of internationally reported values. This suggests that some form of pre-existing protection against severe Covid-19 may exist in South Africa. The observed disease propagation dynamics can be explained by both long-lasting immunity and various scenarios of reinfection in the presence of the more transmissible B.1.351 variant, which is also relatively resistant to antibodies induced by infections of prototype SARS-CoV-2.

In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.","output":"The prognostic significance of the treatment response of regional lymph nodes and the refinement of the current TNM staging system in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on society, global healthcare and daily life.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid implementation of telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: We present outcomes of a complete and rapid transition to telehealth visits at an outpatient integrative medicine center in the Southeastern United States. METHOD: Patients and administrative staff took surveys comparing telehealth to in-person visits within four weeks of our clinic's transition to telehealth and three months later. Beginning four weeks after the clinics telehealth conversion in March 2020, patients who had a telehealth visit at the center completed a survey about their telehealth experience and another survey three months later. RESULTS: Patient quality judgements significantly favored telehealth at baseline, B = .77 [0.29 C 1.25], SE = .25, t(712) = 3.15, p = .002, and increased at three months, B = .27 [C0.03 C 0.57], SE = .15, t(712) = 1.76, p = .079. Telehealth technology usability and distance from the center predicted patient ratings of telehealth favorability. Providers favored in-person visits more than patients, B = C1.00 [C1.56 C C0.44], SE = .29, t(799) = C3.48, p < .001, though did not favor either in-person or telehealth more than the other. Patient discrete choice between telehealth and in-person visits was split at baseline (in-person: n = 86 [54%]; telehealth: n = 73 [46%]), but favored telehealth at three months (in-person: n = 17 [40%]; telehealth: n = 26 [60%]). Overall, discrete choice favored telehealth at follow-up across providers and patients, OR = 2.69 [.1.18 C 6.14], z = 2.36, p = .018. Major qualitative themes highlight telehealth as acceptable and convenient, with some challenges including technological issues.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The goal of this study was to report the intrapartum care experiences from people giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Place of birth included hospital, birth center and home births. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Studies that involved patient-related data collection are hindered by pandemic-related changes in clinical practices and research policies. Our aim was to assess patient experience during a pandemic, we explored data collection via a large online community of pregnant women. We asked if women who birthed during COVID-19 changed their birth setting and if they experienced less respectful care, more pressure to undergo induction and/or cesarean birth and newborn separation. We also wanted to explore whether there were differences in the care experience depending on the race of the woman. Open ended questions on care experiences were included and content analysis conducted. Bivariate analysis was conducted comparing those from high versus less COVID-19 impacted areas and by race (White/Black self-identifying). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The mean age was 31.5 years (SD = 5.0), 80.7% identified as White, 85.0% married, and 85.3% privately insured (N=388). Bivariate unadjusted analyses comparing high vs. low impact COVID-19 states, 22.3% considered changing their place of birth versus 12.7% in less impacted areas (p<.05): no difference pressure for induction/cesarean based on region. In bivariate unadjusted analysis comparing White and Black people, Black people had higher odds of pressure for cesarean or induction compared to White (OR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 48.6, p=.0003). Black people had lower respect scores vs. White (68.7 vs. 72.3 p<.01) and higher odds of preterm birth 3.7 (1.1 to 12.4, p=0.04). Content analysis themes were institutional policies, changes in care, hospital staff interactions, sub-par care, support during birth and mental health. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The analysis demonstrated differences among participants from highly versus less impacted COVID-19 states. Disparities persisted with Black women reporting lower respect, pressure for interventions and more preterm birth when compared to White participants.

Donkeys have a different metabolism than horses, leading to differences in the pharmacokinetics of drugs compared to horses. This study aimed to describe the population pharmacokinetics of DXC in donkeys. Five doses of DXC hyclate (10 mg/kg) were administered via a nasogastric tube, q12 h, to eight non-fasted, healthy, adult jennies. Serum, urine, synovial fluid and endometrium were collected for 72 h following the first administration. Doxycycline concentration was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay. Serum concentrations versus time data were fitted simultaneously using the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization algorithm for nonlinear mixed effects. A one-compartment model with linear elimination and first-order absorption after intragastric administration, best described the available pharmacokinetic data. Final parameter estimates indicate that DXC has a high volume of distribution (108 L/kg) as well as high absorption (10.3 h-1) in donkeys. However, results suggest that oral DXC at 10 mg/kg q12 h in donkeys would not result in a therapeutic concentration in serum, urine, synovial fluid or endometrium by comparison to the minimum inhibitory concentration of common equine pathogens.

The present study aimed to carry out and discover asymptomatic infected individuals in Shenzhen, China. The data will provide the control measures to stop COVID-19 prevalence. Methods: The study was a retrospective review of medical records from 462 confirmed patients with COVID-19 and 45 asymptomatic infected individuals in Shenzhen from January 19 to April 30, 2020; this is a retrospective, observational multicenter study. Results: A total of 462 confirmed cases were diagnosed in Shenzhen from January 19 to April 30, 2020. The cohort included 423 domestic cases (91.56%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.67-93.76) and 39 (8.44%, 95% CI: 6.24-11.33) imported cases from other countries. Moreover, a total of 45 asymptomatic infections were found, encompassing 31 (68.89%, 95% CI: 54.34-80.47) local infections and 14 (31.11%, 95% CI: 19.53-45.66) individuals imported from other countries. The proportion of asymptomatic infected persons in Shenzhen is continuously increasing (Z = 13.19, p < 0.0001). The total number of local asymptomatic infections was more than that in other provinces (2 = 118.83, p < 0.0001).

Agreement among these methods has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL for identification of viral and bacterial pathogens in dairy calves with BRD. ANIMALS: One hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired BRD. METHODS: Calves were sampled by all 4 methods. Viral agents were identified by real\\\\time RT\\\\PCR, bacteria were identified by aerobic culture, and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) isolates were speciated by PCR. Agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results. RESULTS: Agreement among TTW and NS, TTW and NPS, and TTW and BAL, was very good for identification of P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis. For bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS, good for NPS, and very good for BAL. For bovine coronavirus (BCV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS and NPS, and good for BAL. McNemar's test was significant only for BCV, indicating that for this pathogen the proportion of positive results from NS and NPS could not be considered comparable to TTW.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection. Methods We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. Results Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Conclusions Together, these results indicate that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.","output":"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the human ocular surface, suggesting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Previous investigations have identified high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting an outbreak of COVID-19. We investigated care homes reporting a single suspected or confirmed case to assess whether early mass testing might reduce risk of transmission during the peak of the pandemic in London. METHODS: Between 18-27 April 2020, residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 to Public Health England had a nasal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR and subsequent whole genome sequencing. Residents and staff in two care homes were re-tested eight days later. RESULTS: Four care homes were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 20% (65/333) overall, ranging between 3-59%. Among residents, positivity ranged between 3-76% compared to 3-40% in staff. Half of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (23/46, 50%) and 63% of staff (12/19) reported symptoms within 14 days before or after testing. Repeat testing 8 days later in two care homes with the highest infection rates identified only two new cases. Genomic analysis demonstrated a small number of introductions of the virus into care homes, and distinct clusters within three of the care homes. CONCLUSIONS: We found extensive but variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19. While routine whole home testing has now been adopted into practice, care homes must remain vigilant and should be encouraged to report a single suspected case, which should trigger appropriate outbreak control measures.","output":"Mass testing after a single suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in London care homes, April-May 2020: implications for policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current findings suggest that many people experience high levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms and life dissatisfaction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections between patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases using immunosuppressants, and controls (patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases not taking immunosuppressants and healthy controls) who had received full COVID-19 vaccinations. The secondary objective was to explore determinants of breakthrough infections of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, including humoral immune responses after vaccination. METHODS: In this substudy, we pooled data collected in two large ongoing prospective multicentre cohort studies conducted in the Netherlands (Target to-B! [T2B!] study and Amsterdam Rheumatology Center COVID [ARC-COVID] study). Both studies recruited adult patients (age 18 years) with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and healthy controls. We sourced clinical data from standardised electronic case record forms, digital questionnaires, and medical files. We only included individuals who were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. For T2B!, participants were recruited between Feb 2 and Aug 1, 2021, and for ARC-COVID, participants were recruited between April 26, 2020, and March 1, 2021. In this study we assessed data on breakthrough infections collected between July 1 and Dec 15, 2021, a period in which the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant was the dominant variant in the Netherlands. We defined a SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection as a PCR-confirmed or antigen test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that occurred at least 14 days after vaccination. All breakthrough infections during this period were assumed to be due to the delta variant due to its dominance during the study period. We analysed post-vaccination serum samples for anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies to assess the humoral vaccination response (T2B! study only) and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies to identify asymptomatic breakthrough infections (ARC-COVID study only). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to explore potential clinical and humoral determinants associated with the odds of breakthrough infections. The T2B! study is registered with the Dutch Trial Register, Trial ID NL8900, and the ARC-COVID study is registered with Dutch Trial Register, trial ID NL8513. FINDINGS: We included 3207 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who receive immunosuppressants, and 1807 controls (985 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease not on immunosuppressants and 822 healthy controls). Among patients receiving immunosuppressants, mean age was 53 years (SD 14), 2042 (64%) of 3207 were female and 1165 (36%) were male; among patients not receiving immunosuppressants, mean age was 54 years (SD 14), 598 (61%) of 985 were female and 387 (39%) were male; and among healthy controls, mean age was 57 years (SD 13), 549 (67%) of 822 were female and 273 (33%) were male. The cumulative incidence of PCR-test or antigen-test confirmed SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections was similar in patients on immunosuppressants (148 of 3207; 46% [95% CI 39C54]), patients not on immunosuppressants (52 of 985; 53% [95% CI 40C69]), and healthy controls (33 of 822; 40% [95% CI 28C56]). There was no difference in the odds of breakthrough infection for patients with immune-mediate inflammatory disease on immunosuppressants versus combined controls (ie, patients not on immunosuppressants and healthy controls; adjusted odds ratio 088 [95% CI 066C118]). Seroconversion after vaccination (odds ratio 058 [95% CI 034C098]; T2B! cohort only) and SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (034 [018C056]) were associated with a lower odds of breakthrough infections. INTERPRETATION: The incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on immunosuppressants was similar to that in controls. However, caution might still be warranted for those on anti-CD20 therapy and those with traditional risk factors.

These include the potential to offset well-documented global occupational therapy practitioner (OTP) shortages. However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training Survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced Telehealth-User Survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth Survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. Of the participants who completed the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice, 80% reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.","output":"Telehealth in school-based practice: Perceived viability to bridge global OT practitioner shortages prior to COVID-19 global health emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ulcerative colitis (UC), as an intractably treated disease, seriously affects the quality of life of patients and has an increase in terms of incidence and prevalence annually. However, due to the lack of a direct etiology and drug-induced side effects, the medical treatment of UC falls into a bottleneck. There are many natural phytochemicals with the potential to regulate immune function in nature. Herein, a potential mechanism of artemisinin in the treatment of UC and potential druggability compounds with an artemisinin peroxide bond were discussed and predicted based on computer-aided drug design (CADD) technology by using the methods of network pharmacology, molecular docking, de novo drug structure design and molecular dynamics through the integration of artemisinin related targets from TCMSP, ChEMBL and HERB databases.

Previously, we showed that acute (24-h) exposure to TNF promotes mitochondrial fragmentation in human airway smooth muscle (hASM) cells, which is associated with an increased level of cytosolic GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a major protein involved in mitochondrial fragmentation. Phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616 (S616) promotes its translocation and binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane and induces mitochondrial fragmentation; however, phosphorylation of DRP1 at the Ser637 (S637) residue reverses the total process and diminishes fragmentation. The balance between S616 and S637 phosphorylation of DRP1 regulates mitochondrial dynamics. In hASM cells, exposure to TNF triggers protein unfolding and selectively activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway involving the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (pIRE1) and subsequent splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) that acts as a potent transcriptional activator for several downstream genes. We hypothesized that TNF mediated activation of the pIRE1/ XBP1 ER stress pathway transcriptionally activates genes that code for proteins involved in DRP1 phosphorylation at S616 leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. hASM cells were dissociated from bronchial biopsies from patients without a history of respiratory diseases and exposed to TNF (20 ng/ ml for 6 h). Cells were also treated with Mdivi1 (50 M for 6 h), a small-molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial fragmentation that targets the GTPase activity of DRP1. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of putative binding sites for XBP1 on the promoter region of genes that translate into kinases (cyclin dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK5, cyclin B1), which are reported to phosphorylate DRP1 at S616. Western blot and/or immunocytochemistry were employed to quantify the expression and phosphorylation status of IRE1, DRP1, XBP1 splicing, CDKs and cyclin B1. Mitochondrial morphology was assessed by 3-D confocal microscopy using MitoTracker green to label mitochondria. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative real time PCR was done to validate XBP1 target genes. Spliced XBP1 transcriptionally activates expression of CDK1, CDK5 and cyclin B1 and subsequent phosphorylation at S616 of DRP1 without significant alteration in S637 phosphorylation. As a result, TNF induces an increase in S616/S637 phosphorylation ratio that promotes the translocation of DRP1 from cytosol to mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial fragmentation. Inhibition of DRP1 GTPase activity by Mdivi1 ameliorates DRP1 phosphorylation at S616 and significantly reduces mitochondrial fragmentation. These results reveal the mechanisms that underlie TNF induced ER stress and downstream mitochondrial fragmentation.","output":"TNF Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Promotes Differential Phosphorylation of DRP1 and Mitochondrial Fragmentation in Human Airway Smooth Muscle Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A review of infectious disease research activity and capacity was performed in British Columbia and linked to a process for identifying needs, gaps and opportunities from a public health perspective. METHODS: The study was organized in three phases: an environmental scan to describe current research activity in BC; a consultation to identify needs, gaps and opportunities with those conducting research (key informants) and the end users of research results (stakeholders); and a prioritization of the research needs emerging from the consultation. RESULTS: Analysis and synthesis of the consultation data resulted in the identification of nine research themes, which were prioritized in the following order: efficacy and cost-benefit, disease patterns, emerging infectious disease, immunology and vaccines, disease-specific research, health promotion and communications, safe food and water, knowledge translation research and genomics. Six capacity-building themes were also identified: attraction and retention, education and training, collaboration and networks, funding, dissemination of findings, and public health input, surveillance, informatics and databases. INTERPRETATION: The findings were helpful in developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level infectious disease research agenda linking researchers in universities, hospitals and public health institutions with practitioners and policy-makers in British Columbias public health system.

However, the actual feedback from medical teachers and students regarding online education remains unclear. METHODS: A prospective questionnaire survey examined the current opinions of online education from teachers and students at the Medical School of Tongji University. RESULTS: A total of 488 valid questionnaires were collected (223 males, 45.7%; 265 females, 54.3%), including 394 students (80.7%) and 94 teachers (19.3%). Most teachers and students were in favor of online teaching, had positive views for online education, were satisfied with online teaching, and expected for regular online education, although students thought that too much learning tasks had been assigned (90.4% teachers vs. 43.1% students, P < 0.001) and less teaching effect than in offline classes (68.1% teachers vs. 43.4% students). Compared to female counterpart, male students had higher learning interest (27.6% vs. 14.9%), learning attention (29.2% vs. 14.4%), learning efficiency (30.2% vs. 16.7%), and better learning effect (27.6% vs. 15.3%). Furthermore, male students had a significantly rise in attendance rate. Compared with male teachers, female teachers had less experience in online educational course recording (25.9% vs. 50%) and past training for online teaching (53.7% vs. 77.5%). Furthermore, they tended to be more resistant to online teaching (44.4% vs. 22.5%) and less ready for online teaching (70.4% vs. 87.5%). There was no significant difference in the acceptance of online teaching among teachers in different age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Most teachers and students supported and were satisfied with the implementation of online education during the pandemic. Although teachers were less adaptable to online education, they still had positive opinions. Sex influenced the acceptance of online teaching. Male teachers and students showed better adaptability than their female counterparts. Although online teaching has advantages, it still cannot completely replace traditional offline teaching.

Objective: To explore the status, problems and challenges of practical exploration of Shanghai's primary care in responding to COVID-19, providing policy recommendations and decision-making basis for improving the public health emergency system. Methods: From June to September 2020, a qualitative study was conducted using group interviews with administrators and healthcare professionals selected from 10 representative community health centers(CHCs) in suburban, fringe and urban areas in Shanghai's 5 districts for exploring major tasks shouldered by the CHCs, organizational structure of the CHCs, actual tasks performed by the CHCs, internal collaboration, major problems in service delivery during the pandemic, and recommendations, and with directors, as well as professionals responsible for information, healthcare management and quality control, public emergency management and infectious disease containment selected from health commissions and centers for disease control and prevention in the districts, for exploring the functions and roles of CHCs during the pandemic and their weaknesses in anti-pandemic actions, anti-pandemic supports from health commissions and centers for disease control and prevention for CHCs, and ideas about actions of primary care in pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The interviews with individuals from three kinds of affiliations were guided using different types of semi-structured outlines developed by our research team. Results: The interviews revealed that during the pandemic, the CHCs gave emergency responses to COVID-19, participated in regional collaboration for COVID-19 containment, delivered in-hospital COVID-19 screening and triage services while providing routine medical services, and continued to offer family doctor services. Four issues were found to be addressed: insufficient healthcare resources and workers, insufficient services targeting psychological influence of COVID-19, unsatisfied internal coordination and multi-departmental management, and lack of appropriate mechanisms incentivizing healthcare workers and invigorating primary care. Conclusion: In view of the challenges in fighting COVID-19 faced by primary care, it is recommended to take actions on the basis of appropriately balancing the delivery of routine primary care services and public health services, and tasks during pandemic and non-pandemic periods, and appropriately coordinating with higher level departments, as well as developing incentive programs according to the local conditions as a supplement for the government programs.

This is a requirement to comply with international quality standards. Validating a method is a continuous process and taking part in ongoing PT programmes supports the management of a method's life cycle, providing continuing assessment of fitness (sometimes referred to as the 'validation retention status'). Proficiency-testing panel designs ensure that the methods used, particularly diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, are suitably challenged. Appraising PT results over time can illustrate whether the laboratory's performance is stable, improving or worsening, and proficiency tests can also highlight variations in the performance of assays. The development of new proficiency tests can support the implementation of novel diagnostics technologies, such as whole genome sequencing and point-of-care testing, and assist in cross-sectoral partnerships focusing on One Health approaches, which are high on the agenda for infectious disease control. For example, the rapid design and distribution of emergency exempted assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means that these assays were not as rigorously evaluated as assays for established infectious diseases. Therefore, participation in PT programmes for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the performance of these assays. While other mechanisms help to underpin laboratory activities, PT has been, and should remain, an integral part of laboratory quality assurance.

METHODS: We conducted non-participant observation to obtain ethnographic understanding of Hajj health examination activities for 2019. Observations were guided by a checklist and recorded as notes that were analysed thematically. The study was conducted at 11 public (from each region in Malaysia, namely, North, South, East, West of Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak of East Malaysia) and two private primary care clinics. RESULTS: We observed considerable variation in the implementation and practice of Hajj health examinations among the 11 public clinics but no marked variation among the private clinics. The short time span of between three to four months was inadequate for disease control measures and had put pressure on health care providers. They mostly viewed the Hajj health examination as merely a certification of fitness to perform the pilgrimage, though respiratory health assessment was often inadequate. The opportunity to optimise the health of pilgrims with asthma by providing the appropriate medications, asthma action plan and asthma education including the preventive measures was disregarded. The preliminary health screening, which aimed to optimise pilgrims health before the actual Hajj health examination was not appreciated by either pilgrims or health care providers.

This mixed-methods study explored and evaluated the adaptations made to early childhood teacher preparation courses in an undergraduate program in order to provide relevant training through a variety of instructional modalities including face-to-face, virtual, hypothetical, and mixed reality. Focused on maintaining professional standards through adapted coursework designed to meet student learning outcomes, instructors reflected on multiple instructional modalities and analysis of demonstrable learning outcomes for students in a four-year bachelor's degree program resulting in state teacher certification. Data were collected from students from three different cohorts (n = 26) through course assignments, reflections, and instructor- and self-assessments. Results highlight several areas where students found success in meeting professional standards in new ways including: knowledge of development, relevant and responsive curriculum, collaborative engagement, cultural and familial knowledge, inclusive and individualized design, and flexibility and adaptability. Students were prepared to teach in the following ways: designing curriculum, implementation, and reflective practice. Students felt unprepared to teach citing needing more practice and continued skills development. These findings highlight the need for flexibility in the face of the pandemic and underscore the importance of using the new knowledge and practices generated about student learning to reinvent early childhood teacher education programs when faced with post-pandemic realities.","output":"Maintaining Professional Standards in Early Childhood Teacher Preparation: Evaluating Adaptations to Fieldwork-Based Experiences During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary fats are essential for cardiac function The metabolites of fats known as fatty acids provide most of the energy for cardiac tissue, serve as building blocks for membranes and regulate important signaling cascades Despite their importance, excess fat intake can cause cardiac dysfunction The detrimental effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on cardiac health are widely investigated in long-term studies but the short-term effects of fats have not been thoroughly studied To elucidate the near-term effects of a HFD on the growth and maturation of late adolescent heart we subjected 11-week-old mice to an 8-week long HFD (42% of calories from fat, 42% from carbohydrate, n = 8) or chow diet (12% of calories from fat, 66% from carbohydrate, n = 7) and assessed their effects on the heart in vivo and in vitro Our results showed that excessive fat feeding interferes with normal maturation of the heart indicated by the lack of increase in dimensions, volume, and stroke volume of the left ventricles of mice on high fat diet that were evident in mice on chow diet In addition, differences in regional strain during the contraction cycle between mice on HFD and chow diet were seen These changes were associated with reduced activity of the growth promoting PI3K-Akt1 signaling cascade and moderate changes in glucose metabolism without changes in calcium signaling This study suggests that even a short period of HFD during late adolescence hinders cardiac maturation and causes physiological changes that may have an impact on the cardiac health in adulthood","output":"Short high-fat diet interferes with the physiological maturation of the late adolescent mouse heart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common but poorly understood phenomenon in adolescents.

Severe NSSI showed a blunted pattern of cortisol response, despite elevated reported and observed stress during TSST. Severe NSSI showed lower amygdala-mPFC RSFC; follow-up analyses suggested that this was more pronounced in those with a history of suicide attempt for both moderate and severe NSSI. Moderate NSSI showed elevated right amygdala activation to threat; multiple regressions showed that, when considered together with low amygdala-mPFC RSFC, higher right but lower left amygdala activation predicted NSSI severity. Patterns of interrelationships among Sustained Threat measures varied substantially across NSSI severity groups, and further by suicide attempt history.

Few large prospective trials have examined the proximal sides of vessels not ligated in addition to sealing during surgery. We therefore assessed feasibility of an energy device to seal pulmonary artery and vein branches without further ligation. METHODS This prospective, preoperative registration study at 2 institutions evaluated safety of energy sealing with the LigaSure (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), with no additional reinforcing material such as suture ligation, for pulmonary vessels as large as 7 mm during anatomic lung resection (cohort 1 study). A postoperative hemorrhage occurred in the 128th case, so a cohort 2 study proceeded after we changed inclusion criterion for pulmonary arteries from a maximum of 7 mm to a maximum of 5 mm. RESULTS In cohort 1 (n = 128) and cohort 2 (n = 200), 216 and 250 pulmonary arteries and 189 and 213 pulmonary veins, respectively, were treated with energy sealing. Overall postoperative hemorrhage rate was 0.3% (1/328 patients); however, no serious postoperative complications were associated with energy sealing among the 200 patients in cohort 2. Subsequent inspection of the torn artery stump confirmed that the bleeding in the 128th case was in an area adjacent to the sealing zone.

We focused on the effect and possible inadequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) while cleaning teeth and assessed whether doctors proficiency was related to the range of spraying droplets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doctors were divided into three different groups: attending physicians, residents, and intern respectively. Each doctor treated 15 patients; each group comprised 30 patients. The dentists wore leg covers, shoe covers, medical masks, haircaps, full masks, waterproof barrier gowns, and gloves. Each patient was covered with a waterproof hole towel, and the upper edge was fixed to the patient's nose with a medical tape. After cleaning the teeth with water contained red pigment, the spattering distance and range of droplets were calculated. Concurrently, we examined whether there was any droplet contamination on the PPE. RESULTS: With the exception of shoe covers, haircaps, and medical surgical masks, pigment splash marks were found on both the dentist and assistant's PPE. The interns performed cleaning for a significantly longer time than the residents and attending physicians, with a significant statistical difference (P < 0.05). The spatter distance for the interns was significantly larger than the residents (P < 0.05).

Our goal was to determine COVID-19 vaccination intent in a low-income, Latino population receiving aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Southern California, and identify contributing factors and concerns. METHODS: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey was conducted among participants in the Southern California Nutrition Incentives Program (?Ms Fresco! More Fresh). Only Latino respondents were included in this analysis. Primary outcome was vaccine intent trichotomized into: definitely/likely yes, not sure/dont know, and definitely/likely not. RESULTS: The majority of participants (n = 486) were female (93%), Spanish speaking (74%), with a median age of 40 years (IQR = 13). Approximately half (48%) reported they would get a COVID-19 vaccine, 39% were unsure, and 13% reported definitely/likely not. In the multivariable multinomial logistic regression model, participants with a household member with a COVID-19 health risk factor were more likely to be unsure about getting the vaccine. Participants who were primarily English speaking, did not receive the influenza vaccine last season, and reported not reading or talking about COVID-19 were more likely to report not intending to receive the vaccine. Many respondents were concerned about side effects and ingredients, and did not trust the vaccine development process, particularly with how fast it happened. CONCLUSION: Low-income Latinos in Southern California were generally hesitant to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Multiple clinical labs in the United States, Europe, and Asia have gone to considerable lengths to optimize and validate a range of protocols for agnostically detecting viral, bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic parasite nucleic acid across a range of patient specimens to aid in diagnosis for particularly recalcitrant cases. Others see a role for diagnostic metagenomics as a frontline diagnostic to replace other microbiological testing. Areas covered: There are considerable barriers to adoption for diagnostic metagenomics, including analytical sensitivity, interpretation, actionability, turnaround time, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical utility, laboratory workflow, trial comparators, cost, and reimbursement. Expert commentary: Metagenomics is unlikely to become 'one test to rule them all' any time soon, not least because it is not indicative of historical infection like some of the highest volume tests in the clinical virology lab, viral serologies. The high cost and low marginal utility compared to 'standard of care' diagnostics have forced metagenomics to be mostly used for last-ditch cases. However, waiting for such patients to declare themselves as being diagnostically challenging in turn likely lessens the diagnostic yield and actionability of the information. Significant reductions in the cost of metagenomic sequencing are required for it to move up in the diagnostic pipeline. This review covers these associated obstacles of metagenomics, arguing for a parsimonious role in last-ditch diagnostics and awaiting the answer of many outstanding questions regarding its adoption.","output":"The challenge of diagnostic metagenomics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Species reintroductions are growing in popularity, and example motivations include supporting species populations or the restoration of ecosystem function.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESDrug-related adverse events, obstetric-associated safety outcomes among persons who delivered, and a risk-adjusted composite of 28-day COVID-19-related hospital admission or ED visit, COVID-19-associated delivery, or mortality. RESULTSAmong 944 pregnant persons (median [IQR] age 30 [26, 33] years, White (79.5%, N=750), median [IQR] Charlson Comorbidity Index Score 0 (0,0)), 552 persons received mAb treatment (58%).

Based on a model that relates the economic activity to infectious disease epidemics, policies that maximize social welfare are considered. Lockdowns in many countries are measures that restrict economic activity over a wide area, and the economic damage they cause is extremely large. Existing studies on the net benefit of lockdown implemented in 2020 have reached mixed conclusions as to whether it is warranted or not. Although the estimates of costs and effects are relatively stable, the setting of the value of a statistical life for converting effects into benefits has a wide range and is also likely to overestimate benefits. Therefore, a careful procedure for setting is particularly crucial to obtain a reliable evaluation of countermeasures. Compared to uniform restriction of activities, taking measures to restrict activities by selecting targets may improve efficiency. Attributes that can be used to select targets include those that can be identified at little or no cost, such as age and industry, and those that can only be identified at a cost, such as close contact with infectious individuals and the presence of pathogens. In comparison to lockdown, these measures may reduce human suffering and economic suffering.

It is important to understand the unintended consequences of this approach to inform treatment decisions and the consideration of alternative treatments. Recent evidence has shown that ED opioid prescriptions are associated with future opioid use. The objective of this study was to measure the association of opioid administration in the ED to patients treated for back pain with future opioid use. METHODS This is a retrospective study of opioid na?ve adults discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of back pain. Patients were stratified by opioid therapy (none, ED administration only, prescription only, or ED administration + prescription). Relative risks of ongoing opioid use (filling >90-day supply in 180 days following ED visit as documented in the prescription drug monitoring program) were calculated for each opioid therapy group and compared to no the no opioid group. RESULTS We identified 24,487 opioid na?ve back pain patients.. The median age was 38 years, 55% were female and 56% were non-Hispanic white. 41% received no opioid, 10% were only administered an ED opioid, 18% only received a prescription, and 31% received an ED opioid + prescription. The adjusted relative risks of ongoing use compared to the no opioid group were: ED only 1.9, prescription only 2.1, ED+ prescription 2.3. The increased risk persisted for other definitions of ongoing use and after adjustment for baseline pain scores. CONCLUSIONS For opioid na?ve patients with back pain, both ED opioid administration and opioid prescriptions are associated with a doubling of the risk of ongoing opioid use compared to patients not treated with opioids.

Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections; procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs; it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results.

We interviewed 26 senior clinicians (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a range of specialties, at a large Australian tertiary hospital. Interview transcripts were reviewed iteratively, and themes identified inductively, using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Participants from both professions painted clichd portraits of typical doctors and nurses and recounted unflattering anecdotes of their IPC behaviours. Doctors were described as self-directed and often unaware or disdainful of IPC rules;while nurses were portrayed as slavishly following rules, ostensibly to protect patients, irrespective of risk or evidence. Many participants believed that doctors object to being reminded of IPC requirements by nurses, despite many senior doctors having limited knowledge of correct IPC practice. Overall, participants comments suggested that the doctor-nurse game - described in the 1960s, to exemplify the complex power disparity between professions - is still in play, despite changes in both professions, in the interim. Conclusions: The results suggest that interprofessional differences and inconsistencies constrain IPC practice improvement. IPC inconsistencies and failures can be catastrophic, but the common threat of COVID-19 has promoted focus and unity. Appropriate implementation of IPC policies should be context-specific and respect the needs and expertise of all stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework to guide interprofessional collaboration in establishing a path towards sustained improvements in IPC and bio-preparedness.","output":"What is Needed to Sustain Improvements in Hospital Practices Post-COVID-19?

This disparity has prompted investigations to identify clinical and genetic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Headache, a COVID-19 symptom, has been associated with positive disease prognosis. It is logical to consider whether primary headache disorders, among the most prevalent and disabling diseases globally, may also be associated with reduced viral mortality and thereby may have arisen as adaptive host defences. Objective: To study the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and primary headache disorders. Main outcome measure: Using a generalized additive model regression (GAM), we analysed data across 171 nations to identify variables which impact COVID-19 mortality rates (demographics, national wealth and government effectiveness, pandemic management indexes, latitude of the country's capital, prevalence of headache disorders and other diseases). We performed similar analyses of seasonal influenza mortality. Separately, we meta-analysed studies of COVID-19 inpatient survival reporting headache, using PRISMA guidelines. Results: In the global population-level analysis, we observed that a higher prevalence of headache disorders was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, and represented the main variable contributing to differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries (37.8%; F value=10.68). By contrast, we observed a negative trend between the prevalence of headache disorders and influenza death rates. Controversially, when considering headache as a symptom of COVID-19, in the 48 meta-analysed studies we observed a significantly higher risk ratio of survival (RR:2.178 [1.882-2.520], p<0.0001) among COVID-19 inpatients with headache. Conclusions and Relevance: Headache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher COVID-19 mortality, whereas headache as a COVID-19 symptom is associated with enhanced survival. Further studies should clarify whether primary headache disorders represent a risk factor for mortality for COVID-19 or, rather, whether this association reflects evolutionary adaptive processes to enhance survival that, in the case of COVID-19, are insufficiently protective.","output":"The impact of headache disorders on COVID-19 survival: a world population-based analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It had been seven months since the first confirmed case (8th March, 2020) of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and people have now got a more complete picture of the extent of the pandemic.

The current population-based study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and PTSD of the quarantined people in Bangladesh during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 5792 individuals comprised the population of this study. Subjects were respondents to an online questionnaire that was administered through social media. The questionnaire included questions on personal information, quarantine related knowledge, items of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.

This research aims to study the possible correlation between the numbers of swab tests and confirmed cases of infection, with special attention to the sickness level. Study Design: The study is carried out with reference to the Italian case, but the result is of more general importance, in particular for countries with limited availability of ICUs (intensive care units). Methods: The statistical analysis shows correlation between the number of swab tests and those of daily positive cases, mild cases admitted to hospital, intensive care cases, recovery, and death rate, and provides a basis to carry on an AI study. The results were validated using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) approach. Results: Our main result is the identification of a significant statistical effect of reduction of the pressure on the Health system as result of the increase of the tests. The relevance of this result is not confined to the COVID-19 outbreak, because the high demand of hospitalizations and ICU treatments due to this pandemic has an indirect effect on the possibility of guaranteeing an adequate treatment for other high-fatality disease, such as e.g. cardiological, and oncological. Conclusions: Our results show that swab testing may play a major role to decrease the stress on the Health system of a country.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study included COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to four COVID\\\\19 treatment facilities in Bahrain between February 24, 2020 and July 31, 2020. All SCD patients with COVID\\\\19 were included and compared to a randomly selected sample of non\\\\SCD patients with COVID\\\\19. Data were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes. RESULTS: 1792 patients with COVID\\\\19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV, and one (2.6%) death occurred.

We then examine how this framework fits into current published estimates of damage and management costs. Economic impacts associated with feral swine damage and management are plentiful enough to warrant separate treatment from other VIS and are observed in all three categories. For all VIS examined in this study, damage estimates associated with destruction provide the most evaluations of VIS impacts, especially destruction of crops. Evaluations of the losses associated with depredation are largely absent from the literature. We find that while published studies have estimated substantial economic impact associated with VIS, the current state of the literature focusing on VIS frequently fails to address all of the categories of damage, is difficult to compare or replicate, and is unsuited for extrapolation to nation-wide estimates of damage.","output":"Framework for assessing vertebrate invasive species damage: the case of feral swine in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Past: In the early twentieth century, forestry was one of the most important sectors in Norway and an agitated discussion about the perceived decline of forest resources due to over-exploitation was ongoing. To base the discussion on facts, the young state of Norway established Landsskogtakseringen - the world's first National Forest Inventory (NFI). Field work started in 1919 and was carried out by county. Trees were recorded on 10 m wide strips with 1-5 km interspaces. Site quality and land cover categories were recorded along each strip. Results for the first county were published in 1920, and by 1930 most forests below the coniferous tree line were inventoried. The 2nd to 5th inventories followed in the years 1937-1986. As of 1954, temporary sample plot clusters on a 3 km  3 km grid were used as sampling units. Present: The current NFI grid was implemented in the 6th NFI from 1986 to 1993, when permanent plots on a 3 km  3 km grid were established below the coniferous tree line. As of the 7th inventory in 1994, the NFI is continuous, and 1/5 of the plots are measured annually. All trees with a diameter &#8805; 5 cm are recorded on circular, 250 m2 plots. The NFI grid was expanded in 2005 to cover alpine regions with 3 km  9 km and 9 km  9 km grids. In 2012, the NFI grid within forest reserves was doubled along the cardinal directions. Clustered temporary plots are used periodically to facilitate county-level estimates. As of today, more than 120 variables are recorded in the NFI including bilberry cover, drainage status, deadwood, and forest health. Land-use changes are monitored and trees outside forests are recorded. Future: Considerable research efforts towards the integration of remote sensing technologies enable the publication of the Norwegian Forest Resource Map since 2015, which is also used for small area estimation at the municipality level. On the analysis side, capacity and software for long term growth and yield prognosis are being developed. Furthermore, we foresee the inclusion of further variables for monitoring ecosystem services, and an increasing demand for mapped information. The relatively simple NFI design has proven to be a robust choice for satisfying steadily increasing information needs and concurrently providing consistent time series.","output":"A century of National Forest Inventory in Norway - informing past, present, and future decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the current study was to explore awareness and perceived helpfulness of mental health peer workers in Australia, and factors associated with knowledge and perceptions. As part of a broader longitudinal study of mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey of a nationally representative sample of N = 812 Australians was conducted in June 2020. Investigation of peer work comprised two areas: 1) whether they had accessed or were aware of peer workers;and 2) perceived helpfulness of peer workers. Only participants who indicated awareness of peer workers were asked about helpfulness. Seventy-five participants (9.2%) reported accessing a peer worker, but over half the sample were not aware they existed (n = 448). Mean helpfulness ratings indicated that participants believed peer work is somewhat or very helpful. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, age was associated with both greater awareness and perceived helpfulness;awareness was also associated with social impairment, and helpfulness with positive social support.

We thus compared the perioperative effects of TIVA and isoflurane anesthesia on plasma concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins and cell adhesion molecules. METHODS Patients having laparoscopic cholecystectomies were randomly allocated to two groups: 44 were assigned to TIVA and 44 to isoflurane anesthesia. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and the cellular adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were determined preoperatively, before incision, and at 2 and 24 hours postoperatively. Our primary outcomes were area-under-the-curve cytokine and adhesion molecule concentrations over 24 postoperative hours. RESULTS The only statistically significant difference in area-under-the-curve concentrations was for IL-6, which was greater in patients given isoflurane:78 (95% confidence interval (CI): 52 to 109) pg/ml versus 33 (22 to 50) pg/ml, P= 0.006. Two hours after surgery, IL-6 was significantly greater than baseline in patients assigned to isoflurane: 47 (95% CI: 4 to 216, P<0.001) pg/ml versus 18 (95%CI: 4 to 374, P<0.001) pg/ml in the TIVA group. In contrast, IL-10 was significantly greater in patients assigned to TIVA: 20 (95% CI: 2 to 140, P<0.001) pg/ml versus 12 (95% CI: 3 to 126, P<0.001) pg/ml. By 24 hours after surgery, concentrations were generally similar between study groups and similar to baseline values. CONCLUSION The only biomarker whose postoperative area-under-the-curve concentrations differed significantly as a function of anesthetic management was IL-6. Two hours after surgery, IL-6 concentrations were significantly greater in patients given isoflurane than TIVA. However, the differences were modest and seem unlikely to prove clinically important.

Structural narrative analysis provides an answer to the research question about the interplay of external circumstances (structure) and individual choices (agency) in depicting the causes of the Black Death, its course of events, and attribution of its developments and consequences. Findings demonstrate that structure prevails over agency. The textbooks offer no behavioral patterns to internalize and implicitly conceptualize behavior in an epidemic as a mass phenomenon, not as a product of many individual choices. This perception of agency blatantly contradicts the two prerequisites for an effective epidemic response elaborated during the COVID-19 pandemic: quality of governance and populations willingness to comply with authorities recommendations in spite of the growing circulation of false information. The Black Death is presented in Middle Ages  the era of calamities.

Calves were fed milk replacer twice daily and housed individually until weaning at 56 d. Once weaned, calves were moved into groups of 5 until they were moved to a finishing facility at 77 d. At the grain-fed veal facility, calves were scored for fecal consistency for the first 28 d and had fecal samples taken on arrival and at 7 and 14 d. Fecal samples were frozen and submitted to a commercial laboratory, where they were tested for BCoV, C.parvum, and 2 groups of BRoV: group A (BRoV A) and group B (BRoV B). Calves were weighed on arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 77 d using a digital body scale. Treatments for disease and mortalities that occurred over the 77 d were also recorded. Statistical models, including Cox proportional hazards and repeated measures models, were built to determine the effect of infection with 1 of the pathogens. Over the 3 sampling points, 151 (85.8%), 178 (94.2%), 3 (1.5%), and 97 (57.4%) calves tested positive at least once for BCoV, BRoV A, BRoV B, and C.parvum, respectively. The source of the calves and the level of serum total protein measured on arrival were associated with testing positive for a pathogen. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea and severe diarrhea; calves that tested positive for BCoV and BRoV A had an increased proportion of days with severe diarrhea. In addition, calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a higher hazard of being treated for respiratory disease. With respect to body weight, calves that had diarrhea or severe diarrhea had lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d.

Limitations of such serological tests include semi-quantitative measurements, lack of standardization, potential cross-reactivity, and inability to distinguish between antibody subclasses. As a result of cross-reactivity, diagnostic specificity of serological antibody tests may not be sufficiently high to enable screening of the general asymptomatic populations for the acquired immunity against low-prevalence infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Likewise, lack of a single standard for assay calibration limits inter-laboratory and international standardization of serological tests. In this study, we hypothesize that combination of immunoaffinity enrichments with targeted mass spectrometry measurements would enable rational design of serology diagnostics of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.

In addition, a multiplex IP-selected reaction monitoring (IP-SRM) assay facilitated differential quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody isotypes and subclasses in patient sera. Simultaneous evaluation of numerous antigen-antibody subclass combinations revealed a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-IgG1 as a combination with the highest diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. Anti-RBD IgG1, IgG3, IgM and IgA1 subclasses, but not IgG2, IgG4 and IgA2, were found elevated in COVID-19-positive sera.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of remdesivir on clinical and virologic outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients from June to July 2020. Primary clinical endpoints included clinical recovery, additional mechanical ventilator (MV) support, and duration of oxygen or MV support. Viral load reduction by hospital day (HD) 15 was evaluated by calculating changes in cycle threshold (Ct) values. RESULTS: A total of 86 severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated including 48 remdesivir-treated patients. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Remdesivir was administered an average of 7.42 days from symptom onset. The proportions of clinical recovery of the remdesivir and supportive care group at HD 14 (56.3% and 39.5%) and HD 28 (87.5% and 78.9%) were not statistically different. The proportion of patients requiring MV support by HD 28 was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the supportive care group (22.9% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.032), and MV duration was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group (average, 1.97 vs. 5.37 days; P = 0.017). Analysis of upper respiratory tract specimens demonstrated that increases of Ct value from HD 1C5 to 11C15 were significantly greater in the remdesivir group than the supportive care group (average, 10.19 vs. 5.36; P = 0.007), and the slope of the Ct value increase was also significantly steeper in the remdesivir group (average, 5.10 vs. 2.68; P = 0.007).

Current responses are aligned to treatment-based solutions, instead of determining the roles of its inter-related causes. This project aims to assess and understand the complex interplay of eco-bio-social-political factors that determine infantile anaemia to inform policy, research design and prevention practices. METHODS: This is a longitudinal birth cohort study including four components: (1) biological, will assess known blood markers of iron homeostasis and anaemia and stool microbiota to identify and genetically analyse the participants flora; (2) ecological, will assess and map pollutants in air, water and soil and evaluate features of nutrition and perceived food security; (3) social, which will use different qualitative research methodologies to explore key stakeholders and informants perceptions related to nutritional, environmental and anaemia topics, participant observations and a participatory approach and (4) a political analysis, to identify and assess the impact of policies, guidelines and programmes at all levels for infantile anaemia in the three regions. Finally, we will also explore the role of social determinants and demographic variables longitudinally for all study participants. This project aims to contribute to the evidence of the inter-related causal factors of infantile anaemia, addressing the complexity of influencing factors from diverse methodological angles.

Bioelectric impedance (BIA) Phase Angle (PhA) is correlated with outcome in a multitude of diseases and may be of added value in predicting adverse outcome of COVID-19. We aimed to associate baseline body composition parameters with 90-day adverse outcome of COVID-19 including ICU-admission and to explore the added predictive value of baseline PhA. Methods We performed a prospective observational study, conducting BIA amongst COVID-19 patients within 24 hours of hospital admission, with a follow-up of 90 days. Data were compared between ward-only and ICU-patients. Regression models were used to assess the associations between baseline characteristics, body composition and 90-day adverse outcome, including a composite outcome score of morbidity, ICU-admission, and mortality. An ROC-curve was used to explore the added predictive value of PhA to other clinical parameters at baseline for the prediction of adverse outcome. Results One-hundred-and-fifty patients were included. Mean age was 68 (66-70) years, 67% were male. Forty-one (27%) patients were admitted to ICU and 77 (51%) met the criteria of the composite outcome score. In multiple regression, PhA was independently, inversely correlated with risk of ICU-admission (OR .531, p=.021), complications (OR .579, p=.031), hospital length of stay (OR .875, p=.037) and the composite outcome score (OR .502, p=.012). An ROC-curve showed that the incorporation of PhA in a composite risk-score improved the discriminative power for the composite outcome from poor to fair, compared to individual predictors (AUC 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.87). Conclusion BIA measurements including Phase Angle are independently correlated with an adverse outcome of COVID-19.

Also, the process of how miRNAs tend to induce mRNA degradation has been predominantly studied in many infectious diseases. In this article, we would like to discuss the interaction of dietary plant miRNAs derived from fresh fruits against the viral genome of the causative agent of COVID-19, specifically targeting the 3UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) genome. Expanding the analysis, we have also identified plant miRNAs that interact against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 across 37 countries/territories throughout the world. This cross-species virus-plant interaction led us to identify the alignment of dietary plant miRNAs found in fruits like Citrus sinensis (Orange), Prunus persica (Peaches), Vitis vinifera (Grapes) and Malus domestica (Apple) onto the viral genomes. In particular, the interaction of C. sinensis miRNA - csi-miR169C3p and SARS-CoV-2 is noteworthy, as the targeted 3UTR region CTGCCT is found conserved amongst all curated 772 Omicron variants across the globe. Hence this site CTGCCT and miRNA csi-miR169C3p may become promising therapeutic candidates to induce viral genome silencing. Thereby, this study reveals the mechanistic way of how fruits tend to enact a fight against viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and aid in maintaining a strong immune system of an individual.","output":"Unveiling the nature's fruit basket to computationally identify Citrus sinensis csi-mir169C3p as a probable plant miRNA against Reference and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Preventive measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 are essential, but often cause social isolation, affecting the physical and mental health of older adults. Patients with dementia are likely to have worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) owing to pandemic restrictions. To examine this, we described BPSD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified patients at a memory clinic in Japan between October 2018 and December 2019 (15 months before the pandemic began, n = 1,384) and between April 2020 and June 2021 (15 months after the State of Emergency was declared; n = 675 patients). A propensity score was used to match 576 patients from each group. The Mini-Mental State Exam was used to classify cognitive function into mild and moderate/severe. Dementia Behavioral Disturbance Scale was used to evaluate BPSD. The association between BPSD before and during the pandemic was evaluated using binomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: The levels of frequent night waking were higher in individuals before the pandemic than in those evaluated during the pandemic in both the mild group [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.82, 95% CI 1.02C3.23] and the moderate/severe group (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.19C3.23).

CONCLUSION: In patients with cognitive impairment, some BPSD were more prevalent during the pandemic, depending on dementia severity. The findings pertaining to the higher frequency of sleep disturbance and aggressiveness during COVID-19 should be used to guide BPSD screening in patients with dementia and to provide evidence-based interventions.","output":"Prevalence of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Patients With Cognitive Decline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study determined the predictors of caregivers' willingness to accept an accelerated regulatory process for the development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers' attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them appropriately.","output":"Caregivers' Willingness to Accept Expedited Vaccine Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the impact of treatment modality on gastrostomy tube dependence and patient-reported outcomes in human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPSCC).

The aim of the study was to explore the factors for and against webcam use that parents with or without webcam use encountered. METHODS: Guideline-based, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in the period from September 2019 to August 2020. Interview transcripts were analysed using a category-based content analysis. The categories were generated in a combined deductiveCinductive procedure. RESULTS: We interviewed 33 mothers and seven fathers. Parents with webcam experience emphasised positive aspects concerning their webcam use. Factors that increased webcam acceptance included feeling certain about the childs well-being and an increased sense of proximity. Only a few critical voices emerged from parents who had webcam experience, e.g. regarding privacy concerns. Parents who had no experience with webcam use showed ambivalence. On the one hand, they expressed a positive attitude towards the webcam system and acknowledged that webcam use could result in feelings of control. On the other hand, reservations emerged concerning an increase of mental stress or a negative influence on parental visitation behaviour. CONCLUSION: In addition to the parents positive experiences with webcam use, results show a need within parents who lacked webcam experience.

Clinicians are encouraged to avoid FO; however, strategies to avoid FO are not well-described in pediatrics. Our aim was to implement a bundle strategy to prevent FO in children with sepsis and pARDS and to compare the outcomes with a historical cohort. METHODS: A quality improvement initiative, known as preemptive fluid strategy (PFS) was implemented to prevent early FO, in a 12-bed general PICU. Infants on mechanical ventilation (MV) fulfilling pARDS and sepsis criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison, data from a historical cohort from 2015, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids (MIVF) at 50% of requirements; 2. drug volume reduction; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration; 4. early use of diuretics; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment, the standard fluid strategy (SFS), were based on physician preferences. Peak fluid overload (PFO) was the primary outcome. PFO was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as (cumulative fluid input C cumulative output)/kg*100. Fluid input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS group (54% male, 6 mo (IQR 2,11)) and 39 with SFS (64%male, 3 mo (IQR1,7)). PFO was lower in PFS (6.31% [IQR4.4C10]) compared to SFS (12% [IQR8.4C15.8]). FO was lower in PFS compared to CFS as early as 12 h after admission [2.4(1.4,3.7) v/s 4.3(1.5,5.5), p < 0.01] and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input (MIVF and fluid boluses). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS (5%) compared to SFS (28%, p < 0.05). MV duration was 81 h (58,98) in PFS and 118 h (85154) in SFS(p < 0.05). PICU LOS in PFS was 5 (4, 7) and in SFS was 8 (6, 10) days. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS and sepsis resulted in less PFO.

Its water solubility was about 1,030-fold that of PSI-697. THCMA exhibited more potent P-selectin inhibitory effect than PSI-697. The oral efficacy of THCMA was 100-fold that of PSI-697 in inhibiting arterial and venous thrombosis and tenfold in inhibiting inflammation. THCMA inhibited thrombosis at a dose that produces no coagulation disorders and no bleeding risk. THCMA exhibited enhanced antitumor activity over PSI-697 without systemic chemotherapy toxicity. THCMA significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and downregulated the expression levels of serum sP-selectin and TNF in vivo. CONCLUSION: A new small-molecule P-selectin inhibitor, THCMA, has been successfully designed as a nanomedicine with largely enhanced oral efficacy compared to the clinical trial drug PSI-697, and thus might be developed for the oral treatment of arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, inflammation, and cancer-associated thrombosis.","output":"Nanoparticles of a New Small-Molecule P-Selectin Inhibitor Attenuate Thrombosis, Inflammation, and Tumor Growth in Two Animal Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected tribal populations, including the San Carlos Apache Tribe. Universal screening testing in a community using rapid antigen tests could allow for near-real-time identification of COVID-19 cases and result in reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Published experiences of such testing strategies in tribal communities are lacking. Accordingly, tribal partners, with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, implemented a serial testing program using the Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test in 2 tribal casinos and 1 detention center on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation for a 4-week pilot period from January to February 2021. Staff members at each setting, and incarcerated adults at the detention center, were tested every 3 or 4 days with BinaxNOW. During the 4-week period, 3834 tests were performed among 716 participants at the sites. Lessons learned from implementing this program included demonstrating (1) the plausibility of screening testing programs in casino and prison settings, (2) the utility of training non-laboratory personnel in rapid testing protocols that allow task shifting and reduce the workload on public health employees and laboratory staff, (3) the importance of building and strengthening partnerships with representatives from the community and public and private sectors, and (4) the need to implement systems that ensure confidentiality of test results and promote compliance among participants.

However, clinical uptake of esophageal manometry in ICU is still low. Thus, the purpose of review is to describe technical tips to adequately measure esophageal pressure at the bedside, and then update the most important clinical applications of esophageal manometry in ICU. RECENT FINDINGS Each esophageal balloon has its own nonstressed volume and it should be calibrated properly to measure pleural pressure accurately: transpulmonary pressure calculated on absolute esophageal pressure reflects values in the lung regions adjacent to the esophageal balloon (i.e. dependent to middle lung). Inspiratory transpulmonary pressure calculated from airway plateau pressure and the chest wall to respiratory system elastance ratio reasonably reflects lung stress in the nondependent 'baby' lung, at highest risk of hyperinflation. Also esophageal pressure can be used to detect and minimize patient self-inflicted lung injury. SUMMARY Esophageal manometry is not a complicated technique.

This short report assesses what is currently known about FebriDx performance across settings and populations by comparison with some of the more intensively evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific POCTs. While FebriDx shows some potential in supporting triage for early-stage infection in acute care settings, this is dependent on SARS-CoV-2 being the most likely cause for influenza-like illnesses, with reduction in discriminatory power when COVID-19 case numbers are low, and when co-circulating viral respiratory infections become more prevalent during the autumn and winter. Too little is currently known about its performance in primary care and the community to support use in these contexts, and further evaluation is needed.

In this review we analyzed the lockdown-based crisis management which was implemented by nearly all the countries, lessons learned and ways to improve the management of similar events in the future.Methods: An extensive review was performed to collect articles filling the following gaps in most discussions related to COVID-19: the historic experience of previous pandemics, connection of health and wealth, machinery of decision making, and evidence-based evaluation of the crisis management. Findings: (1) Historic experience. Influenza-like pandemics are a natural consequence of human development and, therefore, should not be considered a global threat. The history of the Spanish Flu and numerous less-severe pandemics is well documented. It proves that the COVID-19 problems are not new, unlike round-the-globe governmental reactions that are unprecedented and definitely not based on any successful policy in the past. (2) Health and wealth (risk-benefit analysis). Enormous progress in life expectancy, health status, sharp decrease in infant mortality C all followed the economic progress and were clearly explainable by economic progress. Lost income means lost lives. In Israel, e.g., at least 500,000 life-years were lost to lockdowns. (3) Decision making. Several governments had prepared (years ago) detailed plans of response to influenza-like pandemics. The response plans mentioned lockdowns as a means of last resort only. All these plans were abandoned at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, with lockdowns becoming the first and main instrument. Actually, no scientific discussion took place. The extent of human life loss due to lockdowns themselves has never been taken into consideration in the decision-making process. (4) Crisis management. The forecasts which were chosen for political decision making systematically overestimated the threat, supporting excessive measures. The pro-lockdown evidence is shockingly thin, and based largely on comparing real-world outcomes against dire computer-generated forecasts derived from empirically untested models.Discussion: Special interests of the decision-making groups provide partial explanation of the unprecedented policy. But the policy of depriving citizens of their basic rights could not be implemented without citizens readiness to accept such deprivation. However, it has been stated that at some advanced stage of social development, the citizens C clients of the welfare state C tend to abandon the care of public affairs to the State. Conclusions: Neither special interests nor peoples qualities can be changed in a short time.

METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex.

Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 552 (95% CI 101 to 6448) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change -53%, 95% CI -4 to -76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (-67%, -25 to -86), and avidity was similar (7%, -73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV. INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection.

Tourism demand continues to be severely affected by unforeseen events associated with the current global health crisis, which has led to an examination of ways to predict the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism. Tourism flow forecasting relating to arrivals is of particular importance for tourism and the entire hospitality industry, because it is an indicator of future demand. Thus, it provides fundamental information that can be applied in the planning and development of future strategies. Accurate forecasts of seasonal tourist flows can help decision-makers increase the efficiency of their strategic planning and reduce the risk of decision-making failure. Due to the growing interest in more advanced forecasting methods, we applied the ARMA model method to analyze the evolution of monthly arrival series for Romania in the period from January 2010 to September 2021, in order to ascertain the best statistical forecasting model for arrivals. We conducted this research to find the best method of forecasting tourist demand, and we compared two forecasting models: AR(1)MA(1) and AR(1)MA(2).

We detected Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMV group, in ten pools of adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions. Three of the ten strains were isolated in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most ALSV virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains.

Using internationally comparable Frey-Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. These professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. Till 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia need to adapt during fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate, compensating effects of retraining and new jobs creation.

Considering a reproduction number of R(0) = 3 and 70% immunization effectiveness, we estimated that at least 80% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening with relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). By contrast, at least 60% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening when NPIs are adopted. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to large-gathering events that could lead to infection size spikes. At an immunization coverage of 70%, continuing NPIs, such as wearing masks, could lead to a 78.39% reduction in the maximum cumulative infections and a 67.59% reduction in the median cumulative infections.

We need predictive models to determine patients prognoses and to improve health care resource allocation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While treating COVID-19, we observed differential outcome prediction weights for markers of hepatocellular injury among hospitalized patients. AIM: To investigate the association between hepatocellular injury and all-cause in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This multicentre study employed a retrospective cohort design. All adult patients admitted to Al-Azhar University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt and Abo Teeg General Hospital, Assiut, Egypt with confirmed COVID-19 from June 1, 2020, to July 30, 2020 were eligible. We categorized our cohort into three groups of (1) patients with COVID-19 presenting normal aminotransferase levels; (2) patients with COVID-19 presenting one-fold higher aminotransferase levels; and (3) patients with COVID-19 presenting two-fold higher aminotransferase levels. We analysed the association between elevated aminotransferase levels and all-cause in-hospital mortality. The survival analysis was performed using the KaplanCMeier method and tested by log-rank analysis. RESULTS: In total, 376 of 419 patients met the inclusion criteria, while 29 (8%) patients in our cohort died during the hospital stay. The median age was 40 years (range: 28-56 years), and 51% were males (n = 194). At admission, 54% of the study cohort had liver injury. The pattern of liver injury was hepatocellular injury with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) predominance. Admission AST levels were independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality in the logistic regression analysis. A one-fold increase in serum AST levels among patients with COVID-19 led to an eleven-fold increase in in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). Admission AST levels correlated with C-reactive protein (r = 0.2; P < 0.003) and serum ferritin (r = 0.2; P < 0.0002) levels. Admission alanine aminotransferase levels correlated with serum ferritin levels (r = 0.1; P < 0.04). Serum total bilirubin levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality in the binary logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age and sex but lost its statistical significance in the fully adjusted model. Serum ferritin levels were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (P < 0.01). The probability of survival was significantly different between the AST groups and showed the following order: a two-fold increase in AST levels > a one-fold increase in in AST levels > normal AST levels (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Liver injury with an AST-dominant pattern predicts the severity of COVID-19. Elevated serum ferritin levels are associated with fatal outcomes.","output":"Hepatocellular injury and the mortality risk among patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cannabinoids, mainly cannabidiol (CBD) and (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are the most studied group of compounds obtained from Cannabis sativa because of their several pharmaceutical properties. Current evidence suggests a crucial role of cannabinoids as potent anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases; however, the mechanisms remain largely unclear. Cytokine storm, a dysregulated severe inflammatory response by our immune system, is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic inflammatory disorders, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which results in the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we hypothesized that CBD and THC reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting key inflammatory signaling pathways. The nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling has been implicated in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, which results in the release of pyroptotic cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18. Likewise, the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) causes increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We studied the effects of CBD and THC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in human THP-1 macrophages and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Our results revealed that CBD and, for the first time, THC significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation following LPS + ATP stimulation, leading to a reduction in the levels of IL-1 in THP-1 macrophages and HBECs. CBD attenuated the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), and both cannabinoids inhibited the generation of oxidative stress post-LPS. Our multiplex ELISA data revealed that CBD and THC significantly diminished the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) after LPS treatment in THP-1 macrophages and HBECs. In addition, the phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly downregulated by CBD and THC in THP-1 macrophages and HBECs, which was in turn attributed to the reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase-2 (TYK2) by CBD and THC after LPS stimulation in these cells. Overall, CBD and THC were found to be effective in alleviating the LPS-induced cytokine storm in human macrophages and primary HBECs, at least via modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome and STAT3 signaling pathways. The encouraging results from this study warrant further investigation of these cannabinoids in vivo.","output":"Cannabinoids Alleviate the LPS-Induced Cytokine Storm via Attenuating NLRP3 Inflammasome Signaling and TYK2-Mediated STAT3 Signaling Pathways In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuous spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing people to feel anxiety and stress. This study constructs a four-layer research model to examine how a 360 virtual tour can reduce people's psychological stress through two types of presence (the sense of presence and telepresence) and affective-motivational states (enjoyment and involvement) in this extraordinary period of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to test the moderating effect of involvement, partial least squares (PLS) analysis is employed to analyse valid data collected from 235 individuals. The results of this study indicate that telepresence has a higher impact in generating affective-motivational states than the sense of presence. Among the factors, enjoyment shows the highest effect on satisfaction with the 360 virtual tour experience and stress reduction; involvement moderates the effect of telepresence on satisfaction with the 360 virtual tour experience. This study also contributes to virtual reality research by distinguishing the concepts of sense of presence and telepresence as well as demonstrating the mechanisms whereby virtual reality technology influences people's psychological well-being.

We propose an obstacle avoidance module that combines visual instance segmentation with a depth map to classify and localize objects in the scene. The system avoids obstacles differentially, based on the identity of the objects: for example, the system is more cautious in response to unpredictable objects such as humans. The system can also navigate closer to harmless obstacles and ignore obstacles that pose no collision danger, enabling it to navigate more efficiently.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has directly led to over 600,000 deaths in the US as of July 2021, triggered mass social distancing policies to be enacted as a key deterrent of widespread infections. Social distancing can be challenging in confined spaces required for transportation such as mass transit systems. Little is published regarding the degree to which mass transit system adoption effects impacted the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in urban centers. Taking an ecological approach where areal data are the unit of observation, this national-scale study aims to measure the association between the adoption of mass transit and COVID-19 spread through confirmed cases in US metropolitan areas. National survey-based transit adoption measures are entered in a negative binomial regression model to evaluate differences between areas. The model results demonstrate that mass transit adoption in US metropolitan areas was associated with the magnitude of outbreaks. Higher incidence of COVID-19 early in the pandemic was associated with survey results conveying higher transit use. Increasing weekly bus transit usage in metropolitan statistical areas by one scaled unit was associated with a 1.38 95% CI: (1.25, 1.90) times increase in incidence rate of COVID-19; a 10% increase in weekly train transit usage was associated with an increase in incidence rate of 1.54 95% CI: (1.42, 2.07) times. These conclusions should inform early action practices in urban centers with busy transit systems in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks. Deeper understanding of these observed associations may also benefit modeling efforts by allowing researchers to include mathematical adjustments or better explain caveats to results when communicating with decision makers and the public in the crucial early stages of an epidemic.","output":"Investigating the association between mass transit adoption and COVID-19 infections in US metropolitan areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"F4(+) enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains cause diarrheal disease in neonatal and post-weaned piglets.

We visualize longer-term trends (1990-2020), and compare the robustness of our province-specific results with cumulative COVID-19 incidence using regional data from the Spanish ENECOVID seroprevalence study.

Though this risk is multifactorial, poor glycaemic control before and during admission to hospital for COVID-19 is likely to contribute to the increased risk. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on mobility and interaction can also be expected to impact on daily glucose management of people with diabetes. Telemonitoring of glucose metrics has been widely used during the pandemic in people with diabetes, including adults and children with T1D, allowing an exploration of the impact of COVID-19 inside and outside the hospital setting on glycaemic control. To date, 27 studies including 69,294 individuals with T1D have reported the effect of glycaemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite restricted access to diabetes clinics, glycaemic control has not deteriorated for 25/27 cohorts and improved in 23/27 study groups. Significantly, time in range (TIR) 70C180 mg/dL (3.9C10 mmol/L) increased across 19/27 cohorts with a median 3.3% (? 6.0% to 11.2%) change. Thirty per cent of the cohorts with TIR data reported an average clinically significant TIR improvement of 5% or more, possibly as a consequence of more accurate glucose monitoring and improved connectivity through telemedicine. Periodic consultations using telemedicine enables care of people with diabetes while limiting the need for in-person attendance at diabetes clinics. Reports that sustained hyperglycaemia and early-stage diabetic ketoacidosis may go untreated because of the lockdown and concerns about potential exposure to the risk of infection argue for wider access to glucose telemonitoring. Therefore, in this paper we have critically reviewed reports concerning use of telemonitoring in the acute hospitalized setting as well as during daily diabetes management. Furthermore, we discuss the indications and implications of adopting telemonitoring and telemedicine in the present challenging time, as well as their potential for the future.","output":"Telemonitoring, Telemedicine and Time in Range During the Pandemic: Paradigm Change for Diabetes Risk Management in the Post-COVID Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, \\"smart home\\" systems were designed against Covid-19 virus, which negatively affects life all over the world, and viruses that may become epidemics later Our homes need to be more hygienic and safe than yesterday One of these hygiene rules is the masks that cover our nose and mouth It is very important to use a mask to prevent further spread of the virus Whether or not the people in smart homes are wearing masks at home will be diagnosed with the deep learning method Hosts will be warned if they do not have masks Brightness level control card and illuminator have been added to smart home entrances to better identify people's faces With PID, the illumination level is fixed at the desired value, and with IOT technology, people can follow the illumination level at the smart home entrance from the mobile application","output":"Deep Learning Based Mask Detection in Smart Home Entries during the Epidemic Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that cause COVID-19 becomes a global threat and spread its pandemicity across the boundaries Recent demography issued by WHO forecasting the severity of disease prevalence in more than 200 countries resulted in 16,96,588 laboratory confirmed cases excluding 1,05,952 deaths as on 12 April 2020 Countries like USA (4,92,881), Italy (1,52,271), Spain (1,61,852), Germany (1,20,479) are struggling hard to flatten their epidemic curve of COVID-19 Dynamic strategies are of utmost important in order to manage the crucial spread of SARS-CoV-2 Drug of herbal origin may offer reliable therapeutic opportunity in controlling widespread transmission It was evident from the scientific outcomes that SARSa?CoV-2 gains access in to the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors Hence drugs that reveals potential binding affinity with core amino acid of ACE-2 may expected to interfere the host-viral interaction In our present investigation 28 lead molecules from well documented medicinal herbs were subjected to molecular docking analysis targeting ACE2 receptor and their potential of impeding host-viral interface were evaluated Results of computational analysis signifies that out of 28 ligands nearly 11 bioactive lead molecules exhibit potential binding affinity of about 100% with the target amino acid residue (31 Lys and 353 Lys) br","output":"Scope of phytotherapeutics in targeting ACE2 mediated Host-Viral Interface of SARSa?CoV2 that causes COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","output":"Estimating the overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission using outbreak sizes outside China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (O'Lone E, Viecelli AK, Craig JC, Tong A, Sautenet B, Herrington WG, et al., Am J Kidney Dis 76(1):109C20, 2020) remains the leading cause of death in Singapore. Uncontrolled hypertension confers the highest attributable risk of CVD and remains a significant public health issue with sub-optimal blood pressure (BP) control rates. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention (MCI) versus usual care on lowering BP among adults with uncontrolled hypertension visiting primary care clinics in Singapore. This article describes the statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary objectives related to intervention effectiveness. METHODS: The study is a cluster randomized trial enrolling 1000 participants with uncontrolled hypertension aged  40 years from eight primary care clinics in Singapore. The unit of randomization is the clinic, with eight clusters (clinics) randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MCI or usual care. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months with measurements of systolic and diastolic BP, antihypertensive and statin medication use, medication adherence, physical activity level, anthropometric parameters, smoking status, and dietary habits. The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MCI versus usual care on mean SBP at the 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome is SBP at 24 months. SBP at baseline, 12, and 24 months will be modeled at the subject level using a likelihood-based, linear mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment group and follow-up as fixed effects, random cluster (clinic) effects, Gaussian error distribution, and adjustment to degrees of freedom using the Satterthwaite approximation. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using a similar modeling approach incorporating generalized techniques appropriate for the type of outcome. DISCUSSION: The trial will allow us to determine whether the MCI has an impact on BP and cardiovascular risk factors over a 2-year follow-up period and inform recommendations for health planners in scaling up these strategies for the benefit of society at large. A pre-specified and pre-published statistical analysis plan mitigates reporting bias and data driven approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02972619.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2, either in its natural reservoir or in the human population, is still unclear, but this knowledge is essential for effective prevention and control. We propose a new framework to systematically identify recombination events, excluding those due to noise and convergent evolution. We found that several recombination events occurred for SARS-CoV-2 before its transfer to humans, including a more recent recombination event in the receptor-binding domain. We also constructed a probabilistic mutation network to explore the diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after human infection. Clustering results show that the novel coronavirus has diverged into several clusters that cocirculate over time in various regions and that several mutations across the genome are fixed during transmission throughout the human population, including D614G in the S gene and two accompanied mutations in ORF1ab. Together, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 experienced a complicated evolution process in the natural environment and point to its continuous adaptation to humans. The new framework proposed in this study can help our understanding of and response to other emerging pathogens.","output":"New framework for recombination and adaptive evolution analysis with application to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a high mortality global pandemic. However, the clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to cytokine storm with organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with COVID-19 would be desirable for management, prioritization for trial enrollment, and risk stratification. We sought to develop a prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Data from the Ontario provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data. Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules > 0.92 ) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P > 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question. Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials.","output":"Derivation and Validation of Clinical Prediction Rule for COVID-19 Mortality in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronaviruses disease, namely COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide and resulted in a crucial global health problem.

The antiviral effects of vitamin D can hinder viral replication directly, and also be effective in an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory way. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the serum levels of free 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)-D) in patients with COVID-19 infection in correlation to clinical manifestations and severity in multicenter tertiary-care hospitals, Egypt. Subject and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 150 confirmed patients with COVID-19 by using RT-PCR for detection of the viral RNA. The COVID-19 patients were classified into four groups of mild (n=40) moderate (n=40), severe (n=40), and critical (n=30) based on disease severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)-D were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results According to the current study results, all included patients (n=150) had a low level of serum levels of 25(OH)- D (11.464.47) in COVID -19 patients compared to normal levels. Interestingly, the levels of serum 25(OH)-D were significantly low in severe (9.52.71) and critical (6.262.58) groups compared to mild (16.372.62) and moderate (12.32.62) groups. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between serum 25(OH)-D levels and hemoglobin, platelets, albumin, and SPO2 values. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH)-D levels and LDH, C reactive protein, D dimer, and ferritin levels. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 in particular patients with severe and critical COVID -19 had a significantly low level of serum 25(OH)-D compared to mild and moderate cases, in addition, PSO2 and D dimer were independently correlated with serum 25(OH)-D, thus low serum 25(OH)-D level could be a predictor of severe and critical COVID - 19.

We recorded various patient values, including blood test results. We also noted age, gender, additional diseases, duration of discharge, whether they live or die, whether they smoke, and their radiological staging. Results: In CT imaging with a staging of maximum 4 points and minimum 0 points, the mean value resulted in 1.95. The average radiological stage of the dead patients group was reported as 2.56. There was a correlation between the radiological predictor and the outcome status (p-value: 0.002). The number of smokers was 14 (6.5%). Of the 26 patients who died, 3 were smokers and 23 were non-smokers. Conclusion: 14 of the patients in the study were smokers (6.5%).

Evidences of long-COVID symptoms involving various organ systems are rapidly growing in literature. The objective was to perform a rapid review and evidence mapping of systemic complications and symptoms of long-COVID and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. METHODS: Publications reporting clinical trials, observational cohort studies, caseCcontrol studies, case-series, meta-analysis, and systematic reviews, focusing on the squeal of the disease, consequences of COVID-19 treatment/hospitalization, long-COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, and post acute COVID-19 were reviewed in detail for the narrative synthesis of frequency, duration, risk factors, and pathophysiology. RESULTS: The review highlights that pulmonary, neuro-psychological, and cardiovascular complications are major findings in most epidemiological studies. However, dysfunctional gastrointestinal, endocrine, and metabolic health are recent findings for which underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. Analysis of the clinical trial landscape suggests that more than 50% of the industry-sponsored trials are focused on pulmonary symptoms. In contrast to the epidemiological trends and academic trials, cardiovascular complications are not a focus of industry-sponsored trials, suggestive of the gaps in the research efforts. CONCLUSION: The gap in epidemiological trends and academic trials, particularly concerning cardiovascular complications not being a focus of industry-sponsored trials is suggestive of the gaps in research efforts and longer follow-up durations would help identify other long-COVID-related health issues such as reproductive health and fertility.

With limited access to campus, extensive student choice, and precarious institutional revenue, understanding what makes a positive online student experience in the eyes of students themselves, is vital for institutional survival. Through an in-depth case study of online first-year university students, this research identified six themes that describe students lived experiences of online education (OE), summarised as a motivation, ability, circumstances C interaction, curriculum, environment, or MAC-ICE, thematic structure of the online student experience (OSE). Where online students are deeply motivated, possess the skills to participate effectively in online university education, and are situated in conducive circumstances, they may be well placed for a positive student experience. Supplementing this, universities may facilitate a quality OSE through meaningful interaction with instructors, peers, and course content;flexible, challenging, and relevant curricula;and a reliable, innovative learning environment commensurate with the on-campus student experience. The rich description provided by this research enables generation of propositions about students experiences of OE, and suggests opportunities to enhance the OSE through consideration of identified themes. Implications for practice or policy: * The OSE can be described by students motivation, ability, and circumstances, alongside institutional interaction, curriculum, and environment. * OE may be perceived to involve more work, greater concentration, better time management, more self-regulation, and a heavier reliance on technology, than on-campus education. * OE research may be confounded, where particular MAC-ICE themes are insufficiently considered. * Online student outcomes may be increased through purposeful consideration of all MAC-ICE themes.","output":"The online student experience: A MAC-ICE thematic structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first incident of COVID-19 case in India was recorded on 30th January, 2020 which turns to 100,000 marks on May 19th and by June 3rd it was over 200,000 active cases and 5,800 deaths Geographic Information System (GIS) based spatial models can be helpful for better understanding different factors that have triggered COVID-19 spread at district level in India In the present study, 19 variables were considered that can explain the variability of the disease Different spatial statistical techniques were used to describe the spatial distribution of COVID-19 and identify significant clusters Spatial lag and error models (SLM and SEM) were employed to examine spatial dependency, geographical weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale GWR (MGWR) were employed to examine at local level The results show that the global models perform poorly in explaining the factors for COVID-19 incidences MGWR shows the best-fit-model to explain the variables affecting COVID-19 (R2= 0 75) with lowest AICc value Population density, urbanization and bank facility were found to be most susceptible for COVID-19 cases These indicate the necessity of effective policies related to social distancing, low mobility Mapping of different significant variables using MGWR can provide significant insights for policy makers for taking necessary actions","output":"Spatial analysis of COVID-19 incidence and its determinants using spatial modeling: A study on India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter aims to determine the effect of the Covid-19 epidemic period on individuals' healthy lifestyle behaviors and quality of life.

The use of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) has been advocated as a tool to guide escalation decisions in the community. The performance of this tool applied in this context is unclear. AIM: To evaluate the process of escalation of care to the hospital within a primary care assessment centre (PCAC) designed to assess patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective service evaluation of all adult patients assessed between 30 March and 22 April 2020 within a COVID-19 primary care assessment centre within Sandwell West Birmingham CCG. METHOD: A database of patient demographics, healthcare interactions and physiological observations was constructed. NEWS2 and CRB65 scores were calculated retrospectively. The proportion of patients escalated was within risk groups defined by NHSE guidelines in place during the evaluation period was determined. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were identified. Following assessment 13.3% (n = 20) patients were deemed to require escalation. The proportion of patients escalated with a NEWS2 greater than or equal to 3 was 46.9% (95% CI 30.8C63.6%). The proportion of patients escalated to secondary care using NHSE defined risk thresholds was 0% in the green group, 22% (n = 4) in the amber group, and 81.3% (n = 13) in the red group.

It is only public health measures, such as social distancing (and these included school closures), that have prevented millions of infections and deaths. School closures followed a precautionary principle in that many previous epidemics (e.g. influenza) were mainly transmitted by children. This is supported by few studies and yet, these closures have significantly impacted parents and children. We are now in September 2020, with public health restrictions being lifted in an attempt to attenuate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The easing of restrictions has led to a resurgence of COVID-19 in a second wave of infections. In the meantime, summer school holidays are coming to an end in the northern hemisphere and it is salutary to review the effects on viral surges due to school openings thus far. This review shows that as schools open, outbreaks that affect both pupils and staff occur probably due to failure to adhere to public health principles: hand washing, distancing etc. Reopenings should clearly be done slowly and cautiously so as to control potential COVID-19 outbreaks before they get out of hand.

Traditional approaches such as pursuing clinical electives broadly are no longer feasible and medical students are seeking innovative approaches for engagement. The current study evaluated the efficacy of online information sessions on medical student perception and proposed a timeline for longitudinal medical student recruitment. Methods: The McGill Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery residency program held an online information session for medical students focusing on a wide array of topics related to plastic surgery and residency. Following the session, an anonymous survey was sent to participants gauging their satisfaction with the event and potential effects it had on career planning. Results: Thirty-four participants completed the survey, comprising more than 60% of annual applicants to Canadian plastic surgery programs. 94% of participants stated that their view of McGill?s training program improved and reported a desire for additional sessions from other training programs. 68% of respondents reported being more likely to consider training at McGill and 100% agreed that such sessions could influence their decision to pursue a given training program. Social media was the most common resource used by participants to gain information on training programs. Conclusion: Online information sessions are valuable tools for medical student recruitment and can directly influence their views of a specific training program and affect career planning.

Among the studies on the spread of the COVID-19, few studies have investigated the repeated outbreaks in stages, and the quantitative condition of a controllable spread has not been revealed. In this paper, a brief compartmental model is developed. The effective reproduction number (ERN) of the model is interpreted by the ratio of net newly infectious individuals to net isolation infections to assess the controllability of the spread of COVID-19. It is found that the value of the ERN at the inflection point of the pandemic is equal to one. The effectiveness of the quarantine, even the treatment, is parametrized in various stages with Gompertz functions to increase modeling accuracy. The impacts of the vaccinations are discussed by adding a vaccinated compartment. The results show that the sufficient vaccinations can make the inflection point appear early and significantly reduce subsequent increases in newly confirmed cases. The analysis of the ERNs of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, France, and Peru confirms that the condition of a repeated outbreak is to relax or lift the interventions related to isolation and quarantine interventions to a level where the ERN is greater than one.","output":"Modeling and staged assessments of the controllability of spread for repeated outbreaks of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In triplet-triplet annihilation based photon upconversion, controlling triplet energy transfer (TET) through the system is key to unlocking higher efficiencies.

Median sample size was 133 participants. Vitamin D increased maternal/cord serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, but the dose-response effect was weak. Maternal clinical outcomes were rarely ascertained or reported, but available data did not provide evidence of benefits. Overall, vitamin D increased mean birth weight of 58.33 g (95% confidence interval 18.88 g to 97.78 g; 37 comparisons) and reduced the risk of small for gestational age births (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.90; seven comparisons), but findings were not robust in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. There was no effect on preterm birth (1.0, 0.77 to 1.30; 15 comparisons). There was strong evidence that prenatal vitamin D reduced the risk of offspring wheeze by age 3 years (0.81, 0.67 to 0.98; two comparisons).

The therapeutic activity of adoptive T cell therapy or programmed cell death ligand 1 blockade required cDC1s, which sustained splenic Klrg1+ cytotoxic antitumor T cells and functional intratumoral T cells. KLRG1 and cDC1 genes correlated in human tumors, and PDA patients with high intratumoral KLRG1 survived longer than patients with low intratumoral KLRG1.

The Resilient and Responsive Health Systems (RRHS) Initiative supported by the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has responded to Liberian identified health priorities. Liberias maternal morbidity and mortality rates continue to rank among the highest in the world. Recent country regulations have put forth required continuing professional development (CPD) for all licensed healthcare workers for re-licensure. METHODS: The Model for Improvement was the guiding framework for this CPD to improve midwifery and nursing competencies in assisting birthing women. Two novel activities were used in the CPD. We tested the formal CPD application and approval process as this is a recent regulatory body policy. We also included the use of simulation and its processes as a pedagogical method. Over a two-year period, we developed a two-day CPD module, using didactic training and clinical simulation, for Liberian midwives. We then piloted the module in Liberia, training a group of 21 participants, including midwives and nurses, including pre- and post-test surveys as well as observational evaluation of participant skills. FINDINGS: There were no significant changes in knowledge acquisition noted in the post-test. Small tests of change were implemented during the program, supporting the stages of the Model of Improvement. Observation of skill acquisition was done; however, using a formal observation checklist, such as an Observed Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE), would add more robust findings. The CPD and follow-up activity highlighted the need for human and financial support to maintain the simulation kits and to create sustainability for future trainings. Videotaping the didactic and simulation two-day continuing professional development train-the-trainer workshop expands the sustainability beyond newly prepared trainers. Simultaneous with this CPD, the Liberian Board for Nursing and Midwifery (LBNM) worked with a partner to create a CPD portal. The CPD partners created modules from the videos and have uploaded these modules to the LBNMs new CPD portal. CONCLUSIONS: Using a quality improvement model as a framework for developing and implementing CPDs provides a clear structure and supports the dynamic interactions in learning and clinical care. It is too soon to determine measurable health outcomes resulting from this project. Anecdotal feedback from clinicians and leaders was not directly related to the content of the CPD; however, it does demonstrate an increased awareness of examining changes in practice to support expanded health outcomes.

Hyperimmune antiserum or monoclonal antibodies were added to milk at each feeding or at selected feedings when the amount of antiserum was reduced. Three-day-old piglets were challenged with virulent virus that had been preincubated with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies. The results indicated that supplementing antiserum every other day was not efficacious for protection. Supplementing even small quantities of hyperimmune antiserum (0.5 ml) at least once a day in most cases was sufficient for piglet survival but did not prevent morbidity. Increasing the amount (>2 ml) and providing antiserum 3 times/day completely blocked the TGEV challenge infection. Two monoclonal antibodies were discovered that also provided passive protection for baby pigs. One monoclonal antibody, 5G1, had a high neutralizing titer, and the other, 6C4, was more effective in neutralizing and binding to virulent TGEV than to attenuated TGEVs.

The drug gained popularity during the early stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as an emergency use therapy. It has since been shown in numerous studies that HCQ can actually cause more harm than good. However, its media attention has led to an increase in overdose cases, which can be fatal due to cardiac complications. We present a case of a patient with access to HCQ for COVID-19 prophylaxis who overdosed in a suicide attempt with a favorable outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year old Asian American female with no significant history was found 4-6 hours after ingesting approximately 27 grams of oral HCQ. She was admitted to the intensive care for shock and severe hypokalemia (1.7 mmol/L). The pills were obtained from an overseas third party vendor for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Vitals on arrival were BP 60/30 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, temperature 94.9 fahrenheit. Based on previous case reports and studies on chloroquine, the patient was started on an epinephrine and versed drip, including 2 doses of 60mg diazepam. A single dose of activated charcoal was administered. Initial electrocardiogram revealed conduction abnormalities with QT interval of 549ms (629ms with Bazett's correction). The patient received 240 meq of potassium in a span of 25 hour and began to develop hyperkalemia of up to 6.4 mmol/L. After 48 hours, the patient's blood pressure and potassium levels normalized. On hospital day 4, she was successfully extubated with a favorable remaining hospital course. DISCUSSION: The most life threatening sequelae seen in HCQ overdoses are cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances, mainly potassium. Hyperkalemia after initial severe hypokalemia has been observed in numerous case reports of HCQ overdose and thought to be intracellular shifts rather than relative depletion. Thus, caution should be taken in the correction of initial hypokalemia. A review of previous cases shows an inverse relationship between potassium and HCQ levels, as with our case. Reported toxicity half-life ranges between 11.6 and 31 hours. Our case had an approximate peak concentration of 27 g/ml after 4-6 hours after ingestion with an estimated observed half-life of 27 hours based on recorded concentrations over 45 hours, assuming 1st order elimination. Our patient's hypokalemia began to reverse during the 2nd half-life period which is also consistent with other reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that during the 2nd half-life, when more than 50% of the drug is eliminated, is the period when correction of hypokalemia should be taken with more caution. While these are only observations based on a few case reports, they can provide more insight on how to better manage electrolyte imbalances which can avoid fatal arrhythmias and circulatory arrest.

Unfortunately, the length of the intervention was reduced and sport activities were altered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown mid-intervention, while the shared therapy sessions continued online. This possibly altered the results, as anxiety, depression, and physical aspects did not show significant differences between the experimental and control groups after the intervention. Participants reported positive comments on the experience as a whole, especially regarding the positive influence of the newly developed social connections. This was corroborated by significant correlations between group perceived cohesion and anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and positive experience with the group psychological support.

Online fever clinics were developed by hospitals, largely relieving the hospital's burden. Online fever clinics could help people stay out of crowded hospitals and prevent the risk of cross infections. The objective of our study was to describe the patient characteristics of an online fever clinic and explore the most important concerns and question of online patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study extracted data from fever clinic records in medical information systems from January 24 to February 18, 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. We described the characteristics of patients in fever clinic, then we extracted and classified questions of patient consultations through the online fever clinic dataset. RESULTS: For the 64 487 patients who attended the online fever clinic, the average age was 30.4 years, and 37 665 (58.4%) were female patients. The current state of patients from online were home without isolation (52 360 [81.2%]), home isolated (11 152 [17.29%]), and outpatient observation (975 [1.51%]). From the 594 patient questions analyzed, confirming diagnosis and seeking medical treatment account for 60.61% and 38.05%, respectively, followed by treating (25.59%), preventing (4.38%), and relieving anxiety (1.68%). DISCUSSION: Online fever clinics can effectively relieve patients' mood of panic, and doctors can guide patients with suspected of COVID-19 to isolate and protect themselves through online fever clinic. Online fever clinics can also help to reduce the pressure of hospital fever clinics and prevent cross infection.

However, for such exercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated several times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of time, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the game's challenge according to the player's capabilities. For exercise games, this is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of objects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content Generation for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that match the player's current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific parameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease repetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation of the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept, we implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that includes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized by a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to perform physical activities. To match the player's capabilities, we use Deep Reinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which exercise rooms to include in the maze. We evaluate our prototype in an exploratory user study utilizing both biodata and subjective questionnaires.","output":"Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Virtual Reality Exergames through Experience-driven Procedural Content Generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental influence is one of the attributing factors for health status.

RESULTS NAC is a pleiotropic molecule with a dual antioxidant mechanism; it may neutralize free radicals and acts as a donor of cysteine, restoring the physiological pool of GSH. Serious COVID-19 patients have increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals and often present with glutathione depletion, which prompts a cytokine storm. NAC, which acts as a precursor of GSH inside cells, has been currently used in many conditions to restore or protect against GSH depletion and has a wide safety margin. In addition, NAC has anti-inflammatory activity independently of its antioxidant activity.

Design setting and participants: A representative sample of Australian adults (N=1,204) were randomised to one of six conditions within a factorial design: Framing (Positive; Negative; Control) * Vaccine (Familiar (Pfizer); Unfamiliar (Moderna)). Intervention: Negative Framing involved presenting the likelihood of experiencing side effects (e.g., heart inflammation is very rare, 1 in every 80,000 will be affected), whereas Positive Framing involved presenting the same information but as the likelihood of not experiencing side effects (e.g., 79,999 in every 80,000 will not be affected). Primary Outcome: Booster vaccine intention measured pre- and post-intervention. Results: Positive Framing (M=75.7, SE=0.9, 95% CI[73.9, 77.4]) increased vaccine intention relative to Negative Framing (M=70.7, SE=0.9, 95% CI[68.9, 72.4]) overall (F(1, 1192)=4.68, p=.031, {eta}p2=.004).

One of the most available inductions for TE NDMM patients (pts) worldwide is cyclophosphamide (C), thalidomide (T) and dexamethasone (d)-(CTd). Dara the first anti- CD38, had been combined with VCd, VTd and VRd and markedly increased the depth and duration of the response. We hypothesized that Dara and CTd combination could be safe and allow deeper activity as an alternative protocol. Aims: The aims of this analysis were to evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Dara-CTd treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) after one year of Dara maintenance. Primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the VGPR after two consolidation cycles post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: This is a phase II, open-label single-center clinical trial. The main inclusion criteria were: TE NDMM, creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min, normal cardiac, renal and liver function and the Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status = 0 - 2. The protocol was Dara-CTd for up to four 28-day induction cycles: C-500mg oral (PO) on days 1,8 and 15, T at 100-200mg PO on days 1 to 28, (d) at 40mg PO on days 1,8,15 and 22 and Dara at 16mg/Kg/dose intravenous (IV) on days 1,8,15 and 22 during cycles 1 - 2 and every other week in cycles 3 - 4, followed by ASCT. All pts received up to four 28-day consolidation cycles that was started at D+30 after ASCT: Dara at 16mg/Kg and (d) at 40mg every other week, associated with T at 100mg PO on days 1 - 28. Dara at 16mg/Kg was used monthly as maintenance until progression or limiting toxicity. G-CSF was used for stem cell (SC) mobilization and plerixafor had been allowed whenever the pts need. The MRD was evaluated by next-generation flow (NGF) based and PET-CT was performed when the patient obtained NGF negativity or finished consolidation. PFS outcome was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. All pts received antiviral, anti-pneumocystis and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis. Data cut-off was June 15, 2021. Results: The first pts was enrolled in November 2018. A total of 24 pts were included, the median age being 60 (range 37- 67 years), 23 (92%) were non-white, 5 (21%) had an R-ISS = 1, 12 (54%) had an R-ISS = 2 and 4 (16%), an R-ISS = 3. Six (25%) pts had high-risk chromosomal abnormalities [del17p, t(4;14) or t(14;16)]. To date, all pts have completed induction, 20 have received transplant and 17 have completed D+90 post-transplant assessment. No SC mobilization failure was observed, and six (30%) pts needed plerixafor use. By ITT analysis after a median follow up of 20 months the PFS at 12 and 18 months was 86%. No PFS difference was observed between different subgroups. Regarding response rates, after the end of induction (cycle 4), 19 (90%) of the pts obtained > PR and 8 (38%) obtained >VGPR, including three MRD negativity by NGF. 17 pts have completed two consolidation cycles after transplant and 94% obtained > VGPR as best response, 13 (76%) obtained MRD negativity by NGF and 10 (58%) had negative PET-CT. Seven (41%) pts had both flow and PET-CT negativity. Six pts completed one year of maintenance and five of them (83%) still MRD negativity by NGF. Four pts died from infection, two of them related with covid infection (one before transplant and one during maintenance). Another case post-transplant, considered not related to the investigational agent and one after consolidation, related to the investigational agent. Two pts have discontinued treatment due to progression - 1 before ASCT e 1 during maintenance. The most common adverse events (AEs) grades 3 and 4 were neutropenia (n = 12), infusion reaction (n = 7), neuropathy (n = 6), lymphopenia (n = 4), infection (n = 3), hypertension (n = 1) and rash (n = 1).

Better risk stratification, with discharge of patients with a predicted mild disease trajectory, can ease this burden. Elevated blood-soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has previously been shown to be associated with risk of intubation in confirmed COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether point-of-care measures of suPAR in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of COVID-19 can identify patients that can be safely discharged. METHODS: Observational cohort study including all patients in the ED with symptoms of COVID-19 from March 19 to April 3, 2020. SuPAR was measured at first presentation. Review of electronic patient records 14 days after admission was used to assess disease trajectory. Primary endpoints were mild, moderate, severe, or very severe trajectory. The predictive value of suPAR, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), C-reactive protein (CRP), and duration of symptoms was calculated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 171 (44%) had a mild disease trajectory, 79 (20%) a moderate, 63 (16%) a severe, and 73 (19%) a very severe disease trajectory. Low suPAR was a strong marker of mild disease trajectory. Results suggest a cut-off for discharge for suPAR < 2.0 ng/mL if suPAR is used as a single parameter, and <3.0 ng/mL when combined with NEWS &#8804; 4 and CRP < 10 mg/L.

Although severity of Omicron cases may be reduced, the scale of infection suggests hospital admissions and deaths may be substantial. Definitive conclusions about disease severity require evidence from populations with the greatest risk of severe outcomes, such as residents of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). Methods We used a cohort study to compare the risk of hospital admission or death in LTCF residents in England who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the period shortly before Omicron emerged (Delta dominant) and the Omicron-dominant period, adjusting for age, sex, vaccine type, and booster vaccination. Variants were confirmed by sequencing or spike-gene status in a subset. Results Risk of hospital admission was markedly lower in 398 residents infected in the pre-Omicron period (10.8% hospitalised, 95% CI: 8.13-14.29) compared to 1241 residents infected in the Omicron-period (4.01% hospitalised, 95% CI: 2.87-5.59, adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87, p=0.014); findings were similar in residents with confirmed variant. No residents with previous infection were hospitalised in either period. Mortality was lower in the Omicron versus the pre-Omicron period, (p<0.0001). Conclusions Risk of severe outcomes in LTCF residents with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was substantially lower than that seen for previous variants. This suggests the current wave of Omicron infections is unlikely to lead to a major surge in severe disease in LTCF populations with high levels of vaccine coverage and/or natural immunity.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the determinants of shielding behavior and associations with well-being in a large NHS patient population for informing future health policy. METHODS: Patients contributing to an ongoing longitudinal participatory epidemiology study (Longitudinal Effects on Wellbeing of the COVID-19 Pandemic [LoC-19], n=42,924) received weekly email invitations to complete questionnaires (17-week shielding period starting April 9, 2020) within their NHS personal electronic health record. Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised. RESULTS: The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded. CONCLUSIONS: Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios.","output":"Determinants of Shielding Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations With Well-being Among National Health Service Patients: Longitudinal Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central Nervous System (CNS) infections are one of the most critical problems in public health, as frequently patients exhibit neurologic sequelae. Usually, CNS pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus (MV), herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV) and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under 5 years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or afebrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies and encephalitis. All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the CNS. The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuro-invasive viruses remains scarce. In this review article, we describe the most recent findings associated to neurologic complications, along with data about the possible invasion routes of these viruses in humans and their various effects on the CNS, as studied in animal models.","output":"Neurologic Alterations Due to Respiratory Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: India has taken strong and early public health measures for arresting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. With only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities, India - a democracy of 1.34 billion people - took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed. Objective: To study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 cases in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock-down phase of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID-19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia. Main Outcome and Measures: The current time-series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates time-varying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI). Results: Our predicted cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1-week delay in people's adherence to a 21-day lockdown (March 25 - April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under \\"no intervention\\" and \\"social distancing and travel bans without lockdown\\" are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID-19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. We find some suggestive evidence that the COVID-19 incidence rates worldwide are negatively associated with temperature in a crude unadjusted analysis with Pearson correlation estimates [95% confidence interval] between average monthly temperature and total monthly incidence around the world being -0.185 [-0.548, 0.236] for January, -0.110 [-0.362, 0.157] for February, and -0.173 [-0.314, -0.026] for March. Conclusions and Relevance: The lockdown, if implemented correctly in the end, has a high chance of reducing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for the best outcome. We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself. Data can play a defining role as we design post-lockdown testing, reopening and resource allocation strategies. Software: Our contribution to data science includes an interactive and dynamic app (covind19.org) with short- and long-term projections updated daily that can help inform policy and practice related to COVID-19 in India. Anyone can visualize the observed data for India and create predictions under hypothetical scenarios with quantification of uncertainties. We make our prediction codes freely available (https://github.com/umich-cphds/cov-ind-19) for reproducible science and for other COVID-19 affected countries to use them for their prediction and data visualization work.","output":"Predictions, role of interventions and effects of a historic national lockdown in India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic: data science call to arms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brown HT was fed to rats of both sexes over three generations at dietary concentrations designed to provide daily intakes of 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day.

One way to escape this situation is to search for a job. However, following self-determination theory (SDT), unemployed people's different reasons (i.e., their motivation) for engaging in a job search influence their well-being, attitudes, and behaviors for better or worse. Some research has already supported the associations between different types of motivation and these outcomes, but less is known about how these types of motivation simultaneously associate with these outcomes. The current study addressed this issue by studying how different motivational profiles had different implications for the affective experiences, commitment to employment, and job search behavior of the unemployed. Latent profile analysis, among 865 unemployed individuals from previously disadvantaged communities in South Africa, highlighted four distinct motivational profiles: motivated, ambivalent, amotivated, and unmotivated. The motivated reported some good well-being (i.e., positive experiences) and economic outcomes (i.e., employment commitment and job search), but these came at a cost (i.e., more negative experiences). The same went for the ambivalent, but to a lesser extent. Being unmotivated seemed to have the opposite effect in that it came with psychological benefits, but with economic costs, as these individuals might withdraw from the labor market. This also applied to the amotivated, although they experienced less psychological benefit than their unmotivated counterparts. The findings made several contributions to SDT and unemployment research and could help tailor interventions and policies for particular types of unemployed people.","output":"Motivational Profiles in Unemployment: A Self-Determination Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Pneumomediastinum (PM) is a low-frequency reason for consultation in pediatric services and is defined as the presence of free air in mediastinum structures as a result of overexpansion and rupture of alveolar septa, allowing air to pass through tissue barriers and occupy the mediastinum, neck and other cavities. Incidence of PM in newborns is 1,7-2,5 for every 1000, and in older children it is 1 for every 8000 to 15000 children. PM is more frequent in males and can be subdivided in two categories: spontaneous and secondary. Summary Case: We present the case of an 11-year-old boy without personal history of other pathologies, with history of a recent low-severity infection by Sars-CoV2 that lasted 4 weeks. He consulted pediatric emergency room for two days of odynophagia, acute cough episodes, thoracic pain and bilateral crackling sounds and tumefaction in the subclavicular and neck regions. He was without signs of dyspnea, and thoracic pain 7/10, SatO2 94% in room air, tumefaction was identified bilaterally in subclavicular and neck regions that expanded to the anterior side of the thorax. Crackling sounds were discovered in palpation of these regions, as well as diffuse pain. Respiratory sounds was normal. CXR showed air in the subcutaneous cellular tissue in the neck and thorax. Supplementary oxygen was administered via nasal cannula, as well as analgesic medication. Following studies were ordered to investigate possible causes: chest CT showed PM. The patient's clinical course was favorable and was discharged with no further complications.Discussion: PM is a low-frequency entity in pediatric health care. Several risk factors have been described such as asthma, respiratory infections, inhaled irritating substances and anatomical alterations such as tracheomalacia. Rarely it has been reported in patients affected by COVID-19 and such finding could represent a radiological indicator of potential progression of disease. While it is usually a self-limited condition and resolves by itself during clinical observation, PM can provoke potentially fatal respiratory or cardiovascular events. PM can be identified in simple thorax radiography, however, if it is small it can only be detected through chest CT. Literature reports cases in which PM in COVID-19 patients was not related to mechanical ventilation. This case highlights the association of COVID-19 with PM and the need for health care teams to be alert of this complication, even in patients with no previous history of any other pathological entities or comorbidities.","output":"Pneumomediastinum associated with severe cough following SARS-CoV2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the etiologic agents of the SARS and develop diagnostic method for this disease. METHODS Thirty-six nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 27 patients with SARS in Shenzhen were collected. The samples were aliquotted to three parts and subjected to molecular assays for human metapneumovirus, chlamydia and a novel coronavirus, which was reported recently to be the etiologic agent of SARS. Nested RT-PCR was used to amplify the RNA polymerase gene of the novel coronavirus and the PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloned to pMD18-T vector. RESULTS Human metapneumovirus and chlamydia genes were detected in none of the specimens using the RT-PCR and nested-PCR, respectively. The novel coronavirus gene were amplified in 6 of 36 specimens, the sequence analysis indicated that this novel coronavirus is unrelated to any other coronavirus reported previously. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid alignment between this coronavirus and others was not more than 40% and 70% to 82%, respectively, while the nucleotide sequence cloned from the 6 patients were identical. CONCLUSIONS The SARS patients in Shenzhen were infected with coronavirus and this novel coronavirus is associated with SARS.

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of PRP and ESWT in symptomatic ONFH patients. METHODS: A total of 60 patients aged 40C79 with unilateral ONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stages I, II, and III were randomly assigned to the PRP (N=30) or the ESWT group (N=30). Four treatment sessions were provided in both groups. Assessments were performed at baseline, and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month. Primary outcomes were measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS), and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs). Secondary outcomes were assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Harris Hip Score (HHS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The linear mixed-model analysis was used to evaluate the differences between groups and within groups and the group by time interaction effects. RESULTS: There were significant differences between groups in terms of changes over time for VAS, PPTs, WOMAC, and HHS since 3-month and maintained up to 12-month (P<0.05, except for PPTs at 12-month). The simple main effects showed that the patients in PRP group had greater improvements in VAS (mean difference = ?0.82, 95% CI [?1.39, ?0.25], P=0.005), WOMAC (mean difference = ?4.19, 95% CI [?7.00, ?1.37], P=0.004), and HHS (mean difference = 5.28, 95% CI [1.94, 8.62], P=0.002). No related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: This study supported the effectiveness and safety of both the PRP injection and ESWT in treating ONFH patients. For symptomatic patients with ONFH, intra-articular PRP injection appeared superior to ESWT in pain relief and functional improvement.","output":"Comparisons of Ultrasound-Guided Platelet-Rich Plasma Intra-Articular Injection and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in Treating ARCO ICIII Symptomatic Non-Traumatic Femoral Head Necrosis: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision making is an essentially social process adopted by individuals or groups to identify and choose the best choice among several alternatives. Decision-making choices are influenced by the preferences, values, and beliefs of the individuals or groups involved in the decision-making process. This study was conducted to analyze the social inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the context of their participation in decision making. The study area consisted of 8028 PWDs registered with the government of Pakistan, from which a sample of 488 PWDs was selected through a multistage stratified random sampling technique. These PWDs included physically disabled, blind, crippled, and deaf persons; however, the data were collected from those who were able to be interviewed. Chi-square and Kendalls Tau-b tests were used to determine the strength, level, and direction of association among variables. At the multivariate level, the study found a spurious relation between social inclusion and participation in decision making when controlling for gender, monthly family income, and level of disability of the PWDs. The results highlighted that participation in decision making improved the social inclusion of male and moderately disabled PWDs more positively. However, participation in decision making was a universal feature explaining the social inclusion of PWDs irrespective of their monthly family income. The logistic regression model explained that the social inclusion of PWDs was more likely to occur when PWDs were married, had high monthly family income (PKR 16,500 and above), belonged to a joint family, and actively participated in decision making. The study recommends that ensuring the participation of PWDs in decision making in family, community, school, and other relevant institutions ultimately enhances their social inclusion.","output":"The Influence of Decision Making on Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities: A Case Study of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is a randomized trial that showed beneficial effect on cognition with a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention. During the post-intervention follow-up, COVID19 pandemic emerged resulting in lockdown and reduced services. Our aim is to investigate how lifestyle and behavior changes during the pandemic are related to lifestyle earlier in the study. Method The FINGER cohort included 1260 individuals aged 60-77 years at baseline and at risk of dementia, randomized into multidomain intervention or control groups. A postal survey was sent to all eligible participants from the FINGER study in June 2020 (end of the first wave of the pandemic in Finland), on average 10 year after the baseline. 859 (68%) were still alive and eligible for the survey. Result Total of 735 responders (85% of the eligible participants) were on average 78 years old. They were younger, had higher baseline cognition, and were more often from the former control group than non-responders (p<0.05 for all). The intervention allocation showed no association with self-reported lifestyle changes during the pandemic in diet, exercise, or cognitive activity. Among older participants (>78 y), the intervention group reported more increase in remote contact with friends and relatives (p=0.013) and health care (p=0.042) than the control, and also less pandemic-related reduction in overall contact with friends (p=0.045). Among all, reductions in physical exercise were reported among those who were less physically active earlier in the study. Both increase and decrease in contact with friends and family were reported by those more cognitively active earlier in the study. They also had more increase in remote contacts. Changes in diet were positive (increase in fruit and vegetable intake), but they were not related to earlier diet. Conclusion The FINGER participants reported only minor change in their lifestyle and behavior during the first wave of the COVID pandemic related lockdown. For physical activity, the pandemic appeared to have negative effect particularly among those with lower levels earlier, possibly adding inequalities. Intervention was related to more remote contacts, probably due to better computer literacy after the cognitive training.","output":"Lifestyle and behavior changes during the COVID19 pandemic in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way hospitals work.

In the service literature, the service is usually delivered by a human to a human customer and the quality of the service is often evaluated using the SERVQUAL dimensions. An extensive review of the literature shows there is a lack of an empirical model to assess the perceived service quality provided by a social robot. Furthermore, the social robot literature highlights key differences between human service and social robots. For example, scholars have highlighted the importance of entertainment value and engagement in the adoption of social robots in the service industry. However, it is unclear whether the SERVQUAL dimensions are appropriate to measure social robots service quality. The paper proposes the SERVBOT model to assess a social robots service quality. It identifies, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and entertainment as the five dimensions of SERVBOT. Further, the research will investigate how these five factors influence emotional engagement and future intentions to use the social robot in a concierge service setting. The model was tested using student sampling, and a total of 94 responses were collected for the study. The findings indicate empathy and entertainment value as key predictors of emotional engagement. Further, emotional engagement is a strong predictor of future intention to use a social robot in a service setting. This study is the first to propose the SERVBOT model to measure social robots service quality. The model provides a theoretical underpinning on the key service quality dimensions of a social robot and gives scholars and managers a method to track the service quality of a social robot.

Their use, however, is deeply connected to social and cultural practices and has acquired a variety of personal and social meanings. This article aims to identify the diversity of sociocultural, ethical, and political meanings attributed to face masks, how they might impact public health policies, and how they should be considered in health communication. In May 2020, we involved 29 experts of an interdisciplinary research network on health and society to provide their testimonies on the use of face masks in 20 European and 2 Asian countries (China and South Korea). They reflected on regulations in the corresponding jurisdictions as well as the personal and social aspects of face mask wearing. We analyzed those testimonies thematically, employing the method of qualitative descriptive analysis. The analysis framed the four dimensions of the societal and personal practices of wearing (or not wearing) face masks: individual perceptions of infection risk, personal interpretations of responsibility and solidarity, cultural traditions and religious imprinting, and the need of expressing self-identity. Our study points to the importance for an in-depth understanding of the cultural and sociopolitical considerations around the personal and social meaning of mask wearing in different contexts as a necessary prerequisite for the assessment of the effectiveness of face masks as a public health measure. Improving the personal and collective understanding of citizens' behaviors and attitudes appears essential for designing more effective health communications about COVID-19 pandemic or other global crises in the future. To wear a face mask or not to wear a face mask? Nowadays, this question has been analogous to the famous line from Shakespeare's Hamlet: To be or not to be, that is the question.

Subjects and Methods: An internet-based KAP questionnaire survey was performed among 108 audiologists. The questionnaire included 33 items categorized under the following domains: demographic information and KAP of tele-audiology. Of the 108 audiologists included in the study, 38 admitted to the practice of tele-audiology previously and during the COVID-19 pandemic (tele-practitioners), and 70 respondents had no experience of tele-audiology (non-telepractitioners). Results: Overall higher scores were observed with regard to the knowledge domain, and a mixed attitude regarding tele-practice was observed among audiologists. Most respondents acknowledged the advantages of tele-audiology in clinical practice. However, audiologists were hesitant to utilize this technology owing to the challenges associated with tele-practice. Conclusions: Despite adequate awareness and a positive attitude, a gap is observed between available knowledge and its actual application/utilization in tele-audiology. Tele-audiology practice was limited to counseling, hearing impairment treatment, and troubleshooting tips for hearing aids.

Remdesivir was the first drug to gain emergency FDA approval to be used in COVID-19. Similarly, favipiravir, an anti-influenza drug, is being studied as a potential agent against COVID-19. Contrastingly, hydroxychloroquine has been a controversial drug in the management of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the National Institute of Health (NIH), along with the World Health Organization (WHO), have discontinued clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine as the drug showed little or no survival benefit. Ivermectin, an antihelminthic drug, has shown antiviral properties previously. Additionally, it was described to be effective in vivo against the SARS-CoV-2.

Significant differences in virus removal by T. pyriformis were observed, ranging from no removal (Qbeta, coxsackievirus B5) to 2.7 log(10) (JC polyomavirus) after 48 h of co-incubation of the protist with the virus. Removal rates were conserved even when protists were co-incubated with multiple viruses simultaneously. Video analysis revealed that the extent of virus removal was correlated with an increase in the protists swimming speed, a behavioral trait consistent with the protists response to the availability of food.

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low.

Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences in MDD may be driven, in part, by sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms. Chronic stress is a significant risk factor in MDD, and preclinical rodent models show differential patterns of stress-induced neural remodeling and cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in males and females. For instance, chronic stress leads to synapse loss in the medial prefrontal cortex in male rodents yet has either no effect on- or increases-synapse number in females. Recent reports have implicated microglia, the immune cells of the brain, in MDD, and findings demonstrate sex-specific microglial signatures in both preclinical stress models and MDD patients. Given that microglia can remodel neural architecture, modulate synaptic transmission, and affect subsequent changes in behavior, it is plausible that microglial pathways contribute to differential stress effects on neuroplasticity and function in males and females. As such, this review examines the evidence for sex-specific microglia-neuron interactions in preclinical stress models and in patients with MDD. Discoveries highlighted herein demonstrate divergent microglial contributions in males and females and suggest that future studies investigating stress-linked disorders should be guided by sex-dependent neurobiological and behavioral findings.

METHODS: The main characteristics of the ICSRs reporting TdP with CQ, HCQ, and AZT have been summarized. Co-reported drugs with risk to cause QT prolongation have been described. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) as a measure of disproportionality for reported TdP and individual drugs have been calculated. RESULTS: One hundred seventy ICSRs reporting TdP in association with the drugs of interest were identified (CQ: 11, HCQ: 31, CQ + HCQ: 1, HCQ + AZT: 27, AZT: 100). From these, 41 (24.3%) were received during the pandemic period (December 2019 to February 2021). The median age of the patients was 63, 53, and 63 years old for CQ, HCQ, and AZT, respectively. Reports included concomitant use of other QT-prolonging drugs (CQ 25.0%, HCQ 71.2%, AZT 64.6%). A proportion of the cases were fatal (CQ 25.0%, HCQ 8.6%, AZT 16.1%). Increased disproportionality has been found for the individual drugs and TdP: CQ (ROR: 7.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.82, 12.96), HCQ (ROR: 8.49, 95% CI: 6.57, 10.98), azithromycin (ROR: 8.06, 95% CI: 6.76, 9.61).

Blood samples were collected to measure neutralization antibodies (NAb) by a live virus microneutralization assay (vMN) and surrogate NAb test. The day 56 vMN geometric mean titre (GMT) was 26.2 [95% confident interval (CI), [22.3C30.9] for Combo, 136.9 (95% CI, 104.2C179.7) for BNT162b2, and 14.7 (95% CI, 11.6C18.6) for CoronaVac groups. At 6 months post-first dose, the GMT declined to 8.0, 28.8 and 7.1 in the Combo, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac groups, respectively. Three groups showed reduced neutralizing activity against D614G, beta, theta and delta variants. At day 56 GMT (74.6) and month 6 GMT (22.7), the delta variant in the BNT162b2 group was higher than that in the Combo (day 56, 7.4; month 6, 5.5) and CoronaVac groups (day 56, 8.0; month 6, 5) (p < 0.0001).

The omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is unusual from the other variants of concerns reported earlier as it harbors many novel mutations in its genome particularly with >30 mutations in the spike glycoprotein alone. The current study investigated the variation in binding mechanism which it carries compared to the wild type. The study also explored the interaction profile of spike-omicron with human ACE2 receptor. The structure of omicron spike glycoprotein was determined though homology modeling. The interaction analysis was performed through docking using HADDOCK followed by binding affinity calculation. Finally, the comparison of interactions were performed among spike-ACE2 complex of wild type, delta and omicron variants. The interaction analysis has revealed the involvement of highly charged and polar residues (H505, Arg498, Ser446, Arg493, and Tyr501) in the interactions. The important novel interactions in the spike-ACE2-omicron complex was observed as S494:H34, S496:D38, R498:Y41, Y501:K353, and H505:R393 and R493:D38. Moreover, the binding affinity of spike-ACE2-omicron complex (?17.6Kcal/mol) is much higher than wild type-ACE2 (?13.2Kcal/mol) and delta-ACE2 complex (?13.3Kcal/mol).

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), characterized by collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (cFSGS), has been described 2 decades ago as a major complication of acquired-immunodeficiency syndrome. The pathogenesis of HIVAN has been well studied, including viral entry, host response, and genetic factors.

METHODS: From April 2019 to September 2019, a randomised controlled trial of a 1-day e-learning educational programme on perinatal psychological issues (both perinatal mental health assessment and empathic communication) was conducted to improve empathic communication skills of midwives and perinatal healthcare workers. Two types of measurements (paper-and-pencil multiple-choice test and video-viewing tests of simulated patient) were used to measure the competency of empathic communication skills. RESULTS: Participants (N = 115) were randomly allocated to two groups (Intervention: n = 58, Control: n = 57). The intervention group was at a significantly higher level for both post-tests of empathic communication skills compared with the control group. Both intervention and control groups showed improvements in acquiring knowledge about perinatal mental health assessments.

Other simple measures are keeping a distance of at least 1aa?m from other persons and observing hygiene recommendations, including washing or even disinfecting the hands, coughing into the crook of the arm and remaining at home when sick. Combining the initial letters of the German words for the three measures (Abstand-Hygiene-Alltagsmaske, distance-hygiene-face mask) the acronym AHA was formed, a colloquial German word meaning that the speaker understood the information presented. This acronym was later extended by the letter \\"L\\", initial letter of \\"Lften\\" meaning air ventilation for indoor rooms and arriving at AHA-L, recommended by the federal German Health Institute the Robert Koch Institute. In fact, masks including surgical masks and face coverings can form an effective barrier against the spread of the virus: protecting other people from droplets expelled from the throat of the speaker wearing a mask and even in part protecting the wearer from inhaling droplets emanating from other peoples' throats. Studies to find out if wearing masks might impose risks did not find essential problems: alterations of respiratory parameters due to an increased airway resistance remained within normal limits in healthy adults and even in asthmatics whose disease was well controlled; however, many adults expressed their unease with masks describing them as cumbersome and inconvenient. Emotional resistance against masks made it increasingly more difficult for them to use a mask. Efficient application of masks requires, in addition to a logical explanation of its effect, the evocation of empathy for vulnerable people who can be protected from catching a possibly deadly disease. In children there are very few data on adverse effects of wearing a mask although there is ample experience in children with serious diseases compromising defense against infectious agents acquired via respiratory mucus membranes; however, when using masks appropriately in children relevant adverse effects have not been reported and are not to be expected. Masks should only be used in children when they are healthy and awake and can remove the masks themselves anytime they like. Children 10 years or older can use masks efficiently when they have been informed beforehand appropriate to their age. Under these conditions they can also be obliged to wear masks in certain situations, for example while walking through the school building to their desk in class. To limit the period of wearing a mask normally they will be allowed to remove the mask when sitting in class and keeping their distance. Children in primary schools may use masks, but they should not be obliged to wear them and children in kindergartens should not use masks.

Clusters of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed cases in an infectious cluster.

The learning system is carried out remotely by utilizing information technology. One of the big challenges in implementing the distance learning model is that the academic community is not yet accustomed to using a blended and online learning system. Teaching lecturers must pay attention to student learning styles because in each teaching, their effectiveness will closely match the student's learning method or style, in addition to their personal characteristics and intellectual abilities. Lecturers' lack of understanding of learning styles has a negative impact on students. The purpose of this study was to examine the learning styles of students of the Faculty of Economics, University of Semarang in a bold manner. This study used a descriptive research design.

Various school-based mental health programs have been implemented worldwide, with greater emphasis placed on psychological and social aspects. The bio-psycho-social model provides a holistic and integrated view of mental health based on theory and research evidence. Given the importance of considering all three dimensions in mental health promotion, this study explored reasons for the relative neglect of this approach by studying the early phase of school well-being program development and implementation. Method: In total, 77 Hong Kong government-funded student well-being programs implemented in 2000C2009 were reviewed for the use of biological, psychological, and social interventions. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted to explore program leaders' usage and views regarding theoretical frameworks and evidence-based practice and program evaluation. Challenges encountered in the initial stage of school well-being program development and implementation were identified and analyzed. Results: Of the 77 programs reviewed, only 5 addressed all three bio-psycho-social factors of mental health. A significantly greater number of programs addressed psychological (n = 63) and social (n = 40) factors compared to those that covered biological factors of mental health (n = 13). Of 24 program implementers who responded to the online survey, 75% claimed to have studied or applied a theoretical framework yet only 41.7% considered evidence-based practices to be important. The majority of interviewed participants valued their own practical experience over theory and research evidence. Many programs lacked rigorous evaluation of clear objectives and measurable outcomes, thus the mechanisms of change and program effectiveness were uncertain. Perceived barriers to program adoption and continuation were identified. Conclusion: This study highlighted a neglect of the biological contribution to mental health in school well-being promotion initiatives, possibly due to lack of theoretical knowledge and evidence-based practice among program leaders and implementers in the early phase of school mental health promotion. The bio-psycho-social model should therefore be recommended for student well-being programs as a holistic and integrated theory of mental health underpinning program objectives, mechanisms of change, and measurable outcomes. To develop effective practices in student well-being promotion, more thorough documentation, a rigorous evaluation framework, and support for frontline educators to evaluate their practices were recommended.","output":"A Local Review on the Use of a Bio-Psycho-Social Model in School-Based Mental Health Promotion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been considered to be the most destructive pandemic ever happened in the history of mankind The worldwide research community has put a tenacious effort to carry out research on the COVID-19 to analyse its impact on economic, medical and sociolgoical fields They are trying to solve many crucial issues related to this disease and derive strategies to deal with this global pandemic In this paper, we have analysed the trend, countries affected regionally and the variation of cases at the country level on COVID-19 dataset We have used the Principal component analysis on the COVID-19 dataset variables to reduce the dimensionality and find the most significant variables Further, we have unveiled the hidden community structure of countries by applying the unsupervised clustering approach, K-means We have compared the results with the K-means method The communities achieved after applying the PCA are more precise The resulted communities can be beneficial to researchers, scientists, sociologists, different policy makers and managers of health sector","output":"Community detection using unsupervised machine learning techniques on COVID-19 dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are no robust data on the real onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and spread in the prepandemic period worldwide.

However, the clinical benefits of glue mesh fixation are still controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the acute pain, chronic pain, and recurrence rate between these two fixation methods. METHODS After reviewing all patients in our prospective hernia repair database from February 2008 to December 2017, we identified 583 patients who underwent TEP with tack mesh fixation and 70 patients with glue fixation by a single surgeon. Acute post-operative pain and activity level were evaluated using a Visual Analog Score (VAS) and the modified Medical Outcome Study (MOS) score. The primary endpoint was chronic pain 6 months after TEP. The secondary endpoints were acute pain, activity level, complications, and recurrence. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the glue mesh fixation had significant lower VAS at 2 h post operation during rest and coughing and on the first day after surgery during coughing (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, and p = 0.011). The modified MOS on the first day was higher in the glue group (p < 0.001). There were no reduced risk of chronic pain or increased risk of recurrence for the glue group compared to the tack group [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.237, p = 0.169; OR = 2.498, p = 0.299].

IT firms focus on advanced research activities to stay relevant. Their survival depends on value creations from innovations based on the research. Source of fund to these innovation-related activities are commonly expressed in terms of R&D investment. However, this investment is not the direct indicator of innovation outcome, which impacts firm's survival. This is the gap between R&D investment and survivability of the firm. To narrow the gap, innovation process and value creation have been focuses of firm's innovation literature. The literature has narrowed the gap, but uncertainty still largely exists. Both researchers and practitioners often classified R&D investment as a risky investment. This study continues this line of conversation and offers empirical evidence suggesting that R&D investment could be risk mitigator rather than risk enhancer. Data of 2,087 firm-years in IT industry revealed that successful IT firms may invest in R&D to mitigate innovation-related competitive risks. When risk is under control, survivability of the firm increases. IT firm should, therefore, prioritize R&D investment for innovations and products that mitigate competitive risks.

With the implementation of social distancing practices, telemedicine plays an increasing role in patient care delivery, particularly in the field of Neurology. This is of particular concern in our cancer patient population given that these patients are often at increased infectious risk on immunosuppressive therapies and often have mobility limitations.

Design/methodology/approach The research sample comprising 482 participants was selected at random. Hierarchical multiple regression and the PROCESS Macro for SPSS were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings Perceived CSR was found to have significant direct and mediated effects of purchase intention and corporate reputation through brand image and customer satisfaction. The proposed causal chain is pivotal for understanding how CSR perceptions influence, as well as shape purchase intention and perceived reputation. Research limitations/implications There are three major implications. First, it is important for consumers to be able to perceive CSR initiatives, to consider them as a strategic investment. Second, firms must develop strategies that promote CSR as being positive for society and the environment, as well as for the firm. Third, perceived CSR is an important predictor in the causal chain of relationships that promote brand image and customer satisfaction, which contributes to reputation and purchase intention. One of the major limitations of this study, although COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic in this study, is that cross-sectional data were collected within a single economy. Hence, a longitudinal study with samples from other economies in the region may be conducted to compare and generalize the findings. Social implications At a time when corporate objectives are predominantly designed to satisfy stakeholder interests and to increase return on investment, there is mounting social pressure on shifting managerial mindsets to address issues such as poverty, health and well-being, education for all, social equality, unhealthy consumption, hedonic advertisements, global peace and environmental concerns. Marketing has been criticized for its narrow focus on fulfilling the social needs of a particular target market while ignoring society at large, and this study argues that, through responsible marketing, firms can improve their reputation and at the same time can promote sustainable living. Originality/value Direct and mediated relationships that have previously been studied separately are considered together in a serially mediated unified model.

However, while billions of dollars have been invested in attempting to improve sexual and reproductive health (including HIV) outcomes, far less is understood about associated sexual practices and behaviours. Therefore, the World Health Organization embarked on a global consultative process to develop a short survey instrument to assess sexual health practices, behaviours and health outcomes. In order for the resulting draft survey instrument to be published as a global standard instrument, it is important to first determine that the proposed measures are globally comprehensible and applicable. This paper describes a multi-country study protocol to assess the interpretability and comparability of the survey instrument in a number of diverse countries. METHODS: This study will use cognitive interviewing, a qualitative data collection method that uses semi-structured interviews to explore how participants process and respond to survey instruments. We aim to include study sites in up to 20 countries. The study procedures consist of: (1) localizing the instrument using forward and back-translation; (2) using a series of cognitive interviews to understand how participants engage with each survey question; (3) revising the core instrument based on interview findings; and (4) conducting an optional second round of cognitive interviews. Data generated from interviews will be summarised into a predeveloped analysis matrix. The entire process (a wave of data collection) will be completed simultaneously by 5+ countries, with a total of three waves. This stepwise approach facilitates iterative improvements and sharing across countries. DISCUSSION: An important output from this research will be a revised survey instrument, which when subsequently published, can contribute to improving the comparability across contexts of measures of sexual practices, behaviours and health-related outcomes. Site-specific results of the feasibility of conducting this research may help shift perceptions of who and what can be included in sexual health-related research.

These brief reflections aim to make the problem visible, offer theoretical explanations and some recommendations. The pandemic constitutes a massive crisis that triggers fears and reassuring of diffuse anxieties, which often includes someone to blame. Healthcare workers have become circumstantial scapegoating targets. The inflicted attacks can be understood as reactive hate crimes since they are originated from an allegedly healthy person to an allegedly contaminated person. People seems to incur in a sanitary profiling process based on the health worker's uniform. However, these expressions of hatred are fueled by pre-pandemic circumstances such as the precariousness of health systems and deficient medical equipment, misogyny, or the pervasiveness of authoritarian tendencies. Understanding this situation as a human rights issue, it is suggested to consider measures in order to discourage these attacks, such as: guaranteeing the appropriate conditions of hospitals and the personal protective equipment of workers; development of recognition campaigns of the healthcare staff and the work they carry out (in particular female nurses); and implementing transitory regulations that sanction any hate crime type attack to health workers or the scientific community. Furthermore, educational advocacy efforts should reiterate basic hygiene measures for the people, but also focus on refuting false and pseudoscientific beliefs that contribute to the fear-induced construction of the health worker as a threat of contagion.(AU)","output":"Health workers as hate crimes targets during coviD-19 outbreak in the Americas/ Trabajadores de la salud como objetivos de crmenes de odio durante el brote de COVID-19 en las Amricas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A loud acoustic stimulus that elicits a startle reflex has long been used to study the neurophysiology of cortical and subcortical neural circuits. More recent investigations have shown that startle can act as an early trigger for prepared actions, suggesting a brainstem role in the preparation and initiation of actions. However, in order to attribute any startle-triggered voluntary responses to activation in subcortical structures it is necessary to measure a startle-related activity in these structures. The current study investigated the most effective stimulus for eliciting a detectible startle reflex. While more intense stimuli are more likely to elicit a startle reflex, the current study examined whether broadband noise is more likely than a pure tone to produce a startle at various intensities above 100 dB. Participants performed a button release reaction time task in response to either a 1 kHz tone or a broadband noise pulse with intensities ranging from 82 to 124 dB. Reaction time and EMG from the wrist extensors and the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) were measured. Results showed that startle-related SCM EMG was elicited more frequently by broadband noise compared to pure tones. The higher proportion of startle reflexes observed in SCM was associated with a higher incidence of the voluntary task being triggered early.

DESIGN: Patient self-report surveys at treatment initiation linked to medical records. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration (VA) clinics nationally, 2018C2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2582 patients (76.7% male, mean age 48.7 years, 62.3% Non-Hispanic White) MAIN MEASURES: Patient self-reported preferences for medication and psychotherapy on 0C10 self-anchoring visual analog scales (0=completely unwilling; 10=completely willing). Treatment receipt and adherence (refilling medications; attending 3+ psychotherapy sessions) over 3 months. Logistic regression models controlled for socio-demographics and geographic variables. KEY RESULTS: More patients reported strong preferences (10/10) for psychotherapy than medication (51.2% versus 36.7%, McNemar (2)(1)=175.3, p<0.001). A total of 32.1% of patients who preferred (7C10/10) medication and 21.8% who preferred psychotherapy did not receive these treatments. Patients who strongly preferred medication were substantially more likely to receive medication than those who had strong negative preferences (odds ratios [OR]=17.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]=12.5C24.5). Compared with patients who had strong negative psychotherapy preferences, those with strong psychotherapy preferences were about twice as likely to receive psychotherapy (OR=1.9; 95% CI=1.0C3.5). Patients who strongly preferred psychotherapy were more likely to adhere to psychotherapy than those with strong negative preferences (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.4C7.4). Treatment preferences were not associated with medication or combined treatment adherence. Patients in primary care settings had lower odds of receiving (but not adhering to) psychotherapy than patients in specialty mental health settings. Depression severity was not associated with treatment receipt or adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Mismatches between treatment preferences and treatment type received were common and associated with worse treatment adherence for psychotherapy. Future research could examine ways to decrease mismatch between patient preferences and treatments received and potential effects on patient outcomes.

First, many forms of biometric monitoring are subject to gender bias, among other potential biases, because of assumptions inherent in the design and algorithms interpreting the collected data. Second, the expansion of femtech in particular creates a gender-imbalanced data source that may feed into existing workplace biases against women unless more effective safeguards emerge. Finally, many femtech platforms encourage the kind of information sharing that may reduce womens reasonable expectations of privacy, especially with regard to fertility data, thus increasing the risk of health data privacy invasion. This triple threat to female workers may be offset somewhat by the benefits of health data collection at work and may be remedied at least in part by both legislative and non-legislative means.

The role of eosinophils has poorly been evaluated during Hantavirus infection. METHODS The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of eosinophilia (defined as an eosinophil count above 500 cells/mm3) during haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in a large cohort of patients, and to identify factors associated with eosinophilia. RESULTS Among 387 patients hospitalized for HFRS, 98 (25.3%) had eosinophilia. By univariate analysis, eosinophilia was significantly associated with more severe thrombocytopenia, high C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count and neutrophil count and lower nephrotoxic drug intake. As there was a collinearity between white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, only C-reactive protein level with platelet count and nephrotoxic drug intake were entered in the multivariable analysis. Elevated C-reactive protein concentrations remained independently associated with eosinophilia.

As governments prioritized health and implemented measures such as the closure of non-essential businesses and social distancing, many workers have lost their jobs, been furloughed, or started working from home. Consequently, the world of work has drastically transformed and this period is likely to have major implications for mobility, transportation and the environment. This paper estimates the potential for people to engage in remote work and social distancing using O*NET data and Irish Census data and calculates the potential emission savings, by commuter type from a switch to remote working and occupational social distancing. The results show that while those who commute by car have a relatively high potential for remote work, they are less likely to be able to engage in social distancing in their workplace.

This study explores the impact of T2D and potentially relevant outcomes for new therapies using a unique approach to in-depth qualitative interviews where people with T2D are asked to think about their future with T2D. METHODS: A cross-sectional qualitative interview study among people with T2D from the USA and UK. Interviews explored their treatment journey, perceptions of their future with T2D, and the value of achieving normoglycemia (explored through presentation of two vignettes with hypothetical medications that reduced hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] levels < 7% and < 5.7%). RESULTS: Patients with T2D (N = 50; US n = 25; UK n = 25) were 66.0% male, had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30.8  6.3 kg/m(2), and had a mean of 13.0  10.0 years since diagnosis. Current diabetes treatments included diet and exercise only (8.0%), oral medications only (62.0%), oral plus injections (24.0%), and insulin only (6.0%). Despite being treated, participants reported over 25 different unmet needs related to their T2D across a broad range of domains. The most common concerns were diet, diabetes-related complications, weight changes, and psychological and emotional issues. A large majority of participants indicated that achieving lower HbA1c values would change their life. When reflecting on the value of improved glycemic control, patients primarily anticipated physical improvements and improved psychological well-being. When presented with two hypothetical treatments, about 70% of participants preferred the < 5.7% treatment option over the < 7% HbA1c treatment option. CONCLUSIONS: People with T2D have a high disease burden, a broad range of unmet needs, and extremely varied experiences and expectations on the impacts of T2D on their lives and future. Many patients indicated that achieving near normoglycemia would substantially change their lives primarily in terms of their physical and emotional health.

METHODS: A telephone survey was collected April-June 30, 2020. Symptom and testing prevalence were explored. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 3411 participants, including 2078 (61%) PLWH and 1333 HIV-seronegative (SN) participants from across the US. Thirteen percent (n = 441) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.4% of PLWH vs 12.2% of SN). Among those tested, positivity was higher in PLWH than SN (11.2% vs 6.1%, p = 0.08). Reasons for not being tested included testing not being available (30% of participants) and not knowing where to get tested (16% of participants).

The most frequent neurological complication is encephalopathy, but seizures, paresis, paraplegia, ataxias, aphasias, and decerebration postures have also been described. The complication of decerebration postures has not been previously reported in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a video case of an adult HIV patient with severe coughing paroxysms, post-tussive emesis and syncope, whose workup confirmed the diagnosis of a B. pertussis respiratory infection. During hospitalization, he had fluctuant encephalopathy and post-tussive decerebration postures following paroxysms. He was treated with antibiotic therapy and finally sent home without residual neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the biological plausibility of neurologic complications of pertussis in adults, which, albeit rare, can cause important morbidities.

We describe a case of a patient with underlying lupus nephritis (LN) who presented with severe COVID-19 infection and concomitant LN flare with acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, Favipiravir, considering his risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. As the patients would usually have AKI alongside LN flare, we administered initial steroid therapy at a lower dose (Methylprednisolone 50mg daily) and oral hydroxychloroquine despite the initial concerns on immunosuppressant usage in COVID-19 infections. Although our patient recovered relatively well from COVID- 19 infection, he continued to have positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 up to 29 days of illness. His kidney function stabilised despite having persistent nephrotic range proteinuria. Hence, the attending team decided to pulse the patient with a high dose steroid (IV Methylprednisolone 250mg OD for three days) after two weeks of illness despite the persistent positive swab.

METHODS: We used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 JanuaryC31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs. FINDINGS: The total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US$) and  2646.70 billion (US$ 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% ( 0.95 billion/ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% ( 0.70 billion/ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% ( 2641.61 billion/ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The control measures to prevent the spread of disease resulted in substantial costs from productivity losses amounting to 2.7% (US$ 382.29 billion/US$ 14.14 trillion) of Chinas annual gross domestic product.","output":"Economic burden of COVID-19, China, JanuaryCMarch, 2020: a cost-of-illness study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Patients with hematologic malignancies are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 disease (Vijenthira, Blood 2020). This is likely a result of combination of immunodeficiency conferred by the disease and the therapeutics. The immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccines in patients with exposure to CD19 directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is not established. CD19 CAR-T cell therapies cause B-cell aplasia, which in turn can affect humoral immune response against novel antigens. Herein, we present results from our prospectively conducted clinical study to evaluate immune responses against mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with lymphoma who have received CD19 directed CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: All patients and healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective clinical study evaluating immune responses against commercial COVID-19 RNA vaccines in patients with hematologic malignancies. Plasma samples were generated from heparinized peripheral blood of 4 heathy controls (HCs) receiving the same vaccines and 19 B cell lymphoma patients treated with CD19 CAR- T cells. Samples from ~4 weeks post second dose of the vaccine (d56) were available for 14 CAR-T patients, for 5 CAR-T patients samples were available from ~4 weeks after the first dose (d28). Plasma samples were analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using different full-length recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins and control proteins. Neutralizing activity was measured using the cPass Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (GenScript Biotech). Results: Results from 4 healthy controls and 19 patients (12 males and 7 females) with lymphoma are reported. Median age for the lymphoma patients is 65 years. Eleven patients had large B cell lymphoma, 5 had follicular lymphoma and 3 had mantle cell lymphoma as primary diagnoses. Seventeen patients had advance stage disease (III/IV stage) and had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. All patients received CD19 directed CAR-T cell therapy. Ten patients received Moderna vaccine and 9 received Pfizer vaccine. Median time between CAR-T infusion and first COVID-19 vaccine was 258 days. While the peripheral blood plasma from 3/4 HCs already showed substantial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity at ~4 weeks after the first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, none of the 5 CD19 CAR-T patients analyzed evidenced any antibody-mediated neutralizing activity in their blood at the same point in time (Figure 1A). Around 4 weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, all 4 HCs tested evidenced complete or almost complete neutralizing activity (Figure 1B). In marked contrast, only 1 out of 14 CAR-T patients analyzed evidenced any relevant antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in their blood (Figure 1B). Interestingly, when we asked whether a globally insufficient antibody-mediated immunity was the underlying cause of the lack of a response to the COVID-19 vaccine in our CAR-T patients, we found that that was clearly not the case since anti-Flu, -TT, and -EBV responses were equivalent to the ones observed in HCs (Figure 2A). However, while at ~4 weeks post second dose of the vaccine the HCs showed marked antibody titers against all the viral spike proteins including their delta variants (Figure 2B), that was not the case for our CAR-T patients. The vast majority of our CAR-T patients did not evidence IgG antibody responses against any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins analyzed such as S1, S1 delta, RBD, RBD delta, or S2 (Figure 2B). Conclusion: In this prospectively conducted clinical study, 18 of 19 patients with lymphoma who have received CD19 CAR-T therapy had poor immunogenicity against mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines as measured by neutralization assays and antibody titers. The antibody titers against B.1.617.2 (delta variant, S1 and RBD protein) were also demonstrably poor. The antibody response to common pathogens (flu, EBV, TT) were preserved, suggesting impaired immune response against novel antigens. Long-term follow-up of this study is ongoing.

However, several limitations regarding its adoption are reported in the literature. ObjectiveThis brief paper aims to provide an effective and efficient approach to investigating vaccine adherence against COVID-19 via Google Trends. MethodsThrough the cross-correlational analysis of well-targeted hypotheses, we investigate the predictive capacity of web searches related to COVID-19 towards vaccinations in Italy from November 2020 to November 2021. The keyword \\"vaccine reservation\\" (VRQ) was chosen as it reflects a real intention of being vaccinated (V). Furthermore, the impact of the second-largest Italian national newspaper on vaccines-related web searches was investigated to evaluate the role of the mass media as a confounding factor. ResultsSimple and generic keywords are more likely to identify the actual web interest in COVID-19 vaccines than specific and elaborated keywords. Cross-correlations between VRQ and V were very strong and significant (min r2 = .460, P<.001, lag = 0 weeks; max r2 = .903, P < .001, lag = 6 weeks). Cross-correlations between VRQ and news about COVID-19 vaccines have been markedly lower and characterized by greater lags (min r2 = .190, P=.001, lag = 0 weeks; max r2 = .493, P < .001, lag = -10 weeks). No correlation between news and vaccinations was sought since the lag would have been too high. ConclusionsThis research provides strong evidence in favor of using Google Trends as a surveillance and prediction tool for vaccine adherence against COVID-19 in Italy. These findings prove that the search for suitable keywords is a fundamental step to reduce confounding factors. Additionally, targeting hypotheses helps diminish the likelihood of spurious correlations. It is recommended that Google Trends be leveraged as a complementary infoveillance tool by government agencies to monitor and predict vaccine adherence in this and future crises by following the methods proposed in this manuscript.","output":"Google Trends as a predictive tool for COVID-19 vaccinations in Italy: a retrospective infodemiological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Pneumologie als Teilgebiet der Inneren Medizin widmet sich den Erkrankungen des Lungenparenchyms, des Lungenkreislaufes, der Atmung und der Pleura.

For this reason, vaccination is strongly recommended, especially for patients on active treatment. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the Sars-Cov2 vaccine in cancer patients is not fully investigated. Our trial aim to explore the seroconversion in a large series of vaccinated cancer patients undergoing active treatment. Here we present a subgroup analysis concerning patients affected by breast cancer. Methods: The \\"VAX-on\\" is a single-center study that enrolled 366 cancer patients who underwent oncological treatment within the last six months. The study was approved by the ethics committee and all patients had to sign specific informed consent to be enrolled. Subjects were vaccinated against Sars-Cov2 with mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty)-Pfizer BioNTech. Blood samples were obtained to quantify the production of specific anti-Spike IgG antibodies at day 21 from the first dose and at 6-8 weeks after the second dose. The antibody laboratory title cut-off of 50 U.A./mL defined the seroconversion. Results are shown as Mean and Standard Deviation for Scontinuous variable, percentage (%) for categorical ones. The Mann-Whitney test or Chi-Square test were used to compare continuous or categorical groups, respectively. Results: A total of 100 patients with breast cancer were enrolled. Clinical and demographic data are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 60.5 years and the majority had an ECOG PS of 0 (75%). Almost all were women (97%), with advanced cancer in 60% of cases. In early or advanced setting 46% patients were treated with chemotherapy while 54% were on target therapy (also including monoclonal antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitors). The mean antibody title after the first dose of mRNA Comirnaty vaccine was 2185.039303.26 U.A./mL (MSD), while after the second dose the mean antibody title rise to 6492.1010425.95 (MSD). After the first dose 61% of patients were considered as immunized, meanwhile after the second dose 86% of patients resulted immunized (defined as an antibody title >50 U.A./mL). In the 9 patients in treatment with steroids (prednisone > 10mg/die or equivalent), there was a trend to a decreased antibody development compared to patients without chronic use of steroids (p 0.06 and 0.05 after the first and second dose, respectively). Of interest, patients using G-CSF (12%) had a significant reduction in the production of Sars-Cov2 antibody after vaccination compared to patients who did not use them (p 0.02 and <0.001 after the first and second dose, respectively), with only 75% resulted positively immunized after the second dose (p=0.04). No differences were seen when comparing patients in advanced with non-advanced stage. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated 86% seroconversion in cancer patients after the second dose of mRNA vaccine regardless of disease stage or type of cancer treatment received. Further evaluations are needed to define whether the use of corticosteroids and G-CSF have an impact on seroconversion.","output":"Evaluation of the effects of anticancer treatments in cancer patients undergoing SARS-COV2 vaccination (VAX-on study: Breast cancer subgroup analysis)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a robust parameter estimation method for dynamical systems based on Statistical Learning techniques which aims to estimate a set of parameters that well fit the dynamics in order to obtain robust evidences about the qualitative behaviour of its trajectory.

Here, 312 participants were involved in an online survey. About 14% of the sample presented a risk for SN addiction. Moreover, it was found that stress level predicted SN addiction both directly and indirectly through the effect of individual temporal dissociation, as experienced during SN usage.

Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population.

The work was inspired by PETRONAS' upstream digitalization strategy with five single and dual-string gas lift completions planned from 2018 to 2020, offshore Malaysia. The authors evaluate the impact of the DIAL system in terms of increasing production, optimizing lift-gas injection, reducing well intervention frequency, as well as OPEX and risk reduction. Methods, Procedure, Process: DIAL is a unique technology that enhances the efficiency of gas lift production. Downhole monitoring of production parameters informs remote surface-controlled adjustment of gas lift valves. This enables automation of production optimization removing the need for well intervention. The paper focuses on a well installed in June 2020, the first in a five well campaign. The authors will provide details of the technology, and pilot program phases: system design;pre-job preparations;run in hole and surface hook-up;commissioning and unloading;and subsequent production operations. For each phase, challenges encountered, and lessons learned will be listed together with observed benefits. Results, Observations, Conclusions: DIAL introduces a paradigm shift in the design, installation, and operation of gas lifted wells. This paper will compare the differences between this digital technology and conventional gas lift techniques. It will consider the value added from the design stage through installation operations to production optimization. The DIAL system's ability to operate at greater than 80-degree deviation enabled deeper injection while avoiding tractor interventions for GLV maintenance in the highly deviated section of the well. Built-in downhole sensors provided real-time pressure monitoring that enabled a better understanding of reservoir behaviour and triggered data-driven reservoir stimulation decisions.

The following article describes goal setting and provides five roles/recommendations for conducting the encounter with patient families regarding the imminent or actual death of their relatives. Importantly, the encounter should be family-centred, and the physician should be highly attentive to family needs. The following roles should be applied based on family needs and should not be sequential as numbered. The first and basic role is to inform the family at the earliest possible time and as often as possible. The second goal of the physician is to convey to the family that their relative received the needed therapy during his hospitalisation or in the community. The third goal of the physician is to help the family reach acceptance of the death of their relative and leave the hospital having moved beyond anger and bargaining. The fourth goal of the physician during the encounters is to reduce or alleviate guilt by stating that nothing could have changed the course of the disease and that all efforts were made to save the patient. The fifth role of the physician is to try and help the family as a single entity and maintain their unity during this stressful situation.

The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease are tightly influenced by the host immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. In some condition, the immune response might be uncontrolled, giving rise to hyperinflammatory conditions marked by excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storms) in severe COVID-19 patients, which then can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. Furthermore, treatment using immunomodulator agents including immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive agents can be an option in achieving successful treatment. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of the disease, including host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, and immune mechanisms which contribute to the disease severity and death as well as several potential immunomodulatory agents which can be used in the management of hyperinflammatory syndrome of severe COVID-19.","output":"Hyperinflammation Syndrome in COVID-19 Disease: Pathogenesis and Potential Immunomodulatory Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proximal femurs numerical simulation could give an effective method for predicting the risk of femoral fracture.

Therefore, any drugs which act in an additive or synergistic fashion with opioids to address medical applications have the potential to reduce opioid-related harms. This study was conducted to determine if heroin and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) interact in an additive or independent manner to alter nociception, body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity when inhaled or injected. Groups of male and female rats implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters were exposed to vapor for assessment of effects on temperature and activity. Heroin (50 mg/mL in the propylene glycol; PG) inhalation increased temperature and activity whereas THC (50 mg/mL) inhalation decreased temperature and activity. Effects of combined inhalation were in opposition, and additional experiments found the same outcome for the injection of heroin (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and THC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In contrast, the co-administration of Heroin and THC by either inhalation or injection produced additive effects on thermal nociception assessed with a warm water tail-withdrawal assay in male and female Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.

During this public health emergency, food nutraceuticals could be promising prophylactic therapeutics for COVID-19. Curcumin, a bioactive compound in turmeric, exerts diverse pharmacological activities and is widely used in foods and traditional medicines. This review presents several lines of evidence, which suggest curcumin as a promising prophylactic, therapeutic candidate for COVID-19. First, curcumin exerts antiviral activity against many types of enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by multiple mechanisms: direct interaction with viral membrane proteins; disruption of the viral envelope; inhibition of viral proteases; induce host antiviral responses. Second, curcumin protects from lethal pneumonia and ARDS via targeting NF-B, inflammasome, IL-6 trans signal, and HMGB1 pathways. Third, curcumin is safe and well-tolerated in both healthy and diseased human subjects.

An invaluable and necessary method in identifying and monitoring atypical brain development are growth charts of typically developing individuals in the population. The brain growth charts can offer a series of standard references on typical neurodevelopment, representing an important resource for the scientific and medical communities. In the present paper, we review the relationship between mental disorders and atypical brain development from a perspective of normative brain development by surveying the recent progress in the development of brain growth charts, including four aspects on growth chart utility: 1) cohorts, 2) measures, 3) mechanisms, and 4) clinical translations.

Using household travel diary/survey data, the goal of this study is to assess the role ride-hailing currently plays within trip chains. Specifically, the study aims to determine, within trip chains, who uses ride-hailing services, for what trip/activity purposes, and to/from what types of areas, as well as the characteristics of trip chains that involve ride-hailing segments. To meet these objectives, the study estimates a binary logit model using 2017 National Household Travel Survey data, where the dependent variable denotes the inclusion of at least one ride-hailing trip within a trip chain. Similar to the non-trip-chaining ride-hailing literature, this study indicates that trip chains with ride-hailing legs are positively associated with travelers who are younger, live in high-income households, frequently use transit, and reside in high-density areas. However, this study includes novel findings indicating statistically significant relationships between ride-hailing and trip chains that end in healthcare and social/recreational activities. Moreover, trip chains with ride-hailing tend to have fewer stops and longer activity durations than trip chains without ride-hailing. This study also includes nested logit choice models, wherein the dependent variable denotes the primary mode (ride-hailing, transit, personal vehicle, or non-motorized transport) of a trip chain.

This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. METHODS: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated.

METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted from 10 September 2020 until 10 May 2021. Forty-six patients were randomly allocated to three groups. Sixteen patients were in the postoperative co-amoxiclav (625 mg) group, fifteen in the preoperative co-amoxiclav (625 mg) plus postoperative metronidazole (500 mg) group and fifteen in the preoperative co-amoxiclav (625 mg) plus postoperative amoxicillin (500 mg) group. Evaluation of the postoperative signs of alveolar osteitis and infection was made by a dental surgeon five days postoperatively. Evaluation of the post-surgical extraction pain was made by patients immediately and five days postoperatively on standard 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS). Furthermore, difficulty of surgery was recorded for all patients immediately postoperatively using (VAS). RESULTS: all antibiotics used in this study were effective. Only 15% of patients had painful alveolar osteitis and 2% had oral infections. There was no significant decrease in the number of patients with severe alveolar osteitis or infection for co-amoxiclav plus metronidazole and co-amoxiclav plus amoxicillin groups compared to co-amoxiclav group at 5 days post-operation (p-values: 0.715, 0.819 & 0.309). Clinically, metronidazole was more effective in protecting the extracted tooth socket from alveolar osteitis compared to co-amoxiclav and amoxicillin. Moreover, there were significant decreases in mean pain scores at 5 days post-operation compared with the levels of pain immediately after surgery (p-value: 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a single preoperative dose of co-amoxiclav with a full postoperative dose of amoxicillin or metronidazole was more effective than conventional treatment with postoperative co-amoxilcalv in reducing the incidence of both alveolar osteitis and infection after surgical extractions. However, these differences were not statistically significant.

The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available.

In this work, we present evaporation models applicable for arrays of sessile microdroplets with dissolved solute submerged in a thin layer of oil. Our model accounts for the variable diffusion distance due to the presence of the oil film separating the droplet and air, the diffusive interaction of neighboring droplets, as well as the variation of the solution density and water activity due to the evolving solute concentration. Our model shows excellent agreement with experimental data for both pure water and NaCl solution. With this model, we demonstrate that assuming a constant evaporation rate and neglecting the diffusive interactions can lead to severe inaccuracies in the measurement of droplet concentration particularly during nucleation experiments.

Three short stories by Poe, i.e., The Masque of the Red Death, The Cask of Amontillado, and The Sphinx are chosen for examination using the thematic analysis method. Repeated reading of the short stories shows that parallels can be drawn between these stories and todays phenomenon about anxiety, social restriction, and health protocols. What can be implied from the analysis are as follows: (1) Fear of the disease results in the characters added distress, (2) The characters aberrant behaviour as to overprotect themselves is exacerbated by the dreadful situation, and (3) Poes obsession with dread and death to shock the readers can be historically traced through his own inner predicaments, ill-health, and the 1832 Cholera contagion.

The rate of congenital syphilis increased greatly with an average yearly rise of 719%, from 001 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 1991 to 1968 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005. INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that a range of unique biological and social forces are driving the spread of syphilis in China. A national campaign for detection and treatment of syphilis, and a credible prevention strategy, are urgently needed.","output":"Syphilis in China: results of a national surveillance programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present investigation aimed to evaluate the radiomitigative efficacy of the recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) against acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in a rat model. Rats were irradiated with a single sublethal dose of -radiation (7 Gy; total body irradiation; TBI) on the 1st day of experimental course, then received EPO (5000 IU/kg; i.p.) 24 h after irradiation, and rats were observed for 30 days of survival analysis. Administration of EPO improved 30-day survival, alleviated TBI-induced myelosuppression and pancytopenia, by augmenting lymphocytes and other white blood cells in the peripheral blood of rats, while bone marrow and spleen cellularity were restored. EPO post-exposure treatment alleviated hepatotoxicity biomarkers and restored splenic function. EPO abrogated radiation-induced oxidative stress through the upregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (-7-nAChR) and the pro-survival Janus kinase-2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription JAK-2/STAT-3 signaling mediated via enhancing nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf-2) cytoprotective machinery in liver and spleen of irradiated rats.

In 2015, over 400000 deaths worldwide were attributed to HCV infection. This led the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to set the ambitious goal of eliminating HCV by 2030. Adult-centered guidelines have been established in order to provide direction for healthcare professionals, allowing integration of the newest screening policies and therapeutic strategies into their practices. However, for children and adolescents, HCV is a significant, unrecognized public health problem. HCV infection rates in the United States in women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant have increased in parallel with the rising opioid epidemic. An estimated 29000 women with HCV infection gave birth each year from 2011 to 2014 in the United States, with approximately 1700 of their infants being infected with HCV. Newer HCV-specific therapeutics, namely direct acting antivirals (DAA), has brought a new and highly successful approach to treatment of hepatitis C. Recent studies have confirmed similar levels of effectiveness and safety of DAA therapies in the pediatric population. Thus, an enhanced cascade of care, which should include the population under 18 years of age, can help achieve the WHO goal by focusing on elimination in the youngest populations.

Our aim was to assess the impact of ultrasound-guided TPLA regarding urodynamic improvement and sexual function, monitoring clinical data, postprocedural complications and imaging findings at 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Forty-four patients aged  50 affected with moderate to severe LUTS (International Prostate Symptoms score  12) due to benign prostatic obstruction and refractoriness, intolerance or poor compliance to medical therapies underwent US-guided TPLA between May 2018 and February 2020. Clinical measurements included PSA, uroflowmetry, sexual function assessment (using the International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction short form) and quality of life questionnaire. Adverse events were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo scale. Volume changes were measured by MRI and automatic segmentation software during 1-year follow-up. Registration: NCT04044573 C May 5th, 2018, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov RESULTS: MRI assessed the changes over time with a 53% mean reduction of adenoma volume and 71% of the ablated area, associated with clinical and functional improvement and resolution of LUTS in all cases. Five of 44 patients (11.3%) had urinary blockage due to clots and required re-catheterisation for 2 weeks. The overall adverse event rate was 7%. CONCLUSION: US-guided TPLA performed as a safe, manageable and effective treatment for LUTS.

It is unknown if there is racial/ethnic variability in this quality measure in pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). We aim to determine whether racial/ethnic differences exist in wait times for children presenting to PEDs and examine between-site and within-site differences. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study for PED encounters in 2016 using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry, an aggregated deidentified electronic health registry comprising 7 PEDs. Patient encounters were included among all patients 18 years or younger at the time of the ED visit. We evaluated differences in emergency department wait time (time from arrival to first medical evaluation) considering patient race/ethnicity as the exposure. RESULTS: Of 448,563 visits, median wait time was 35 minutes (interquartile range, 17-71 minutes). Compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and other race children waited 27%, 33%, and 12% longer, respectively. These differences were attenuated after adjusting for triage acuity level, mode of arrival, sex, age, insurance, time of day, and month [adjusted median wait time ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.11 (1.10-1.12) for NHB, 1.12 (1.11-1.13) for Hispanic, and 1.05 (1.03-1.06) for other race children compared with NHW children]. Differences in wait time for NHB and other race children were no longer significant after adjusting for clinical site. Fully adjusted median wait times among Hispanic children were longer compared with NHW children [1.04 (1.03-1.05)]. CONCLUSIONS: In unadjusted analyses, non-White children experienced longer PED wait times than NHW children. After adjusting for illness severity, patient demographics, and overcrowding measures, wait times for NHB and other race children were largely determined by site of care. Hispanic children experienced longer within-site and between-site wait times compared with NHW children.

As the apprentices training objective was acutely endangered by the expected lengthy teaching downtimes, it was of crucial importance to successfully establish homeschooling. While members of our teaching staff were additionally bound by support for the Munich crisis unit, the switch to virtual classroom teaching for all ongoing courses significantly increased the overall workload of the staff. In a first step, we established a fast video and communication platform via Microsoft Skype. All other issues had to be solved on the fly due to the lack of preparation time. Soon it became obvious that using only classic upfront teaching methods was not an option due to the resulting monotony of a full-time 35 h training week. Additionally, we had to ensure that exams would also be possible during homeschooling to avoid the accumulation of missing performance assessments. Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations. A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations. Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching.

PROGRAM We describe logistics of establishing and operating isolation and noncongregate hotels for COVID-19 mitigation and use the isolation hotel as an opportunity to understand COVID-19 symptom evolution among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). IMPLEMENTATION Multiple agencies in Atlanta, Georgia, established an isolation hotel for PEH with COVID-19 and noncongregate hotel for PEH without COVID-19 but at risk of severe illness. PEH were referred to the isolation hotel through proactive, community-based testing and hospital-based testing. Daily symptoms were recorded prospectively. Disposition location was recorded for all clients. EVALUATION During April 10 to September 1, 2020, 181 isolation hotel clients (77 community referrals; 104 hospital referrals) were admitted a median 3 days after testing. Overall, 32% of community referrals and 7% of hospital referrals became symptomatic after testing positive; 83% of isolation hotel clients reported symptoms at some point; 93% completed isolation. Among 302 noncongregate hotel clients, median stay was 18 weeks; 61% were discharged to permanent housing or had a permanent housing discharge plan. DISCUSSION Overall, a high proportion of PEH completed isolation at the hotel, suggesting a high level of acceptability.

In univariate analysis, the AKI cohort had higher peak levels of triglycerides (OR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.6) per 1 mmol/L increase) and C reactive protein (OR, 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.12) per 10 mg/L increase), with higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR, 3.8 (95% CI, 1.46 to 10.4)) and inotropic support (OR, 15.4 (95% CI, 3.02 to 2.81)). In multivariate analysis, triglycerides were independently associated with AKI stages 2C3 (adjusted OR, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.6)). At follow-up, none had macroalbuminuria and all had sCr values <ULRI. No discrepancy in renal involvement between pandemic waves was found. CONCLUSION: Despite a high incidence of AKI in PIMS-TS, renal recovery occurs rapidly with current therapies, and no patients developed chronic kidney disease.","output":"Acute kidney injury in paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is not associated with progression to chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the twin crises of sovereign debt and COVID-19, the ECB risks being stuck in a situation of fiscal dominance, in which monetary policy is subordinated to the needs of finance ministers. A strong post-COVID-19 recovery may increase inflationary pressures, requiring a shift towards a less accommodative monetary policy stance. A tightening of monetary policy may, however, lead to a widening of interest rate spreads and new bond market tensions in the euro area. This article argues that the credibility of the ECB is undermined if it is perceived as aiming to close interest spreads.

One of the efforts is utilizing the biomarkers. For instance, elevated homocysteine level, already known risk factor of ischemic stroke, is currently identified in COVID-19 patients. AIM: The aim of the study is to assess factors associated with homocysteine level and clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Dr. Zainoel Abidin Hospital di Indonesia between March and August 2021. Ischemic stroke patients who had physical and neurology examinations, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction swab, chest X-ray, electrocardiography, head computed tomography-scan and the total homocysteine level were included. To assess the factors associated with homocysteine level and the outcomes of ischemic stroke patients, the independent Student t-test or analysis of variance and Chi-squared were used, respectively. RESULTS: We included 62 ischemic stroke patients of which 32 (51.6%) were male and the age ranged between 30 and 80 years. Out of total, 60 patients (96.8%) were survived after the hospital admission. There was a significant association between gender and having COVID-19 with homocysteine level (p = 0.012 and p = 0.020, respectively). Having COVID-19 was the only variable significantly associated with the outcome of the ischemic stroke patient (p = 0.035).

In order to minimise the number of hospital visits for patients receiving durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented 4-weekly (20 mg/kg) durvalumab in place of 2-weekly infusions at The Royal Marsden Hospital. We assessed the potential impact of the safety of a 4-weekly schedule in patients receiving adjuvant durvalumab. We carried out a retrospective study of 40 patients treated with 2-weekly and 4-weekly infusions of durvalumab prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical documentation was analysed from 216 consultations across 40 patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab and 66 consultations of 14 patients who switched from 2-weekly to 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab, the rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities was 15 % compared to 7% in patients receiving 4-weekly durvalumab. Pre-existing autoimmune disease was considered a risk factor for the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicities. We did not observe any difference in the rate of grade 1 and 2 toxicities between the two groups.

METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, radiology, and treatment data of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively collected. The population was stratified by disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe, based on guidelines of the National Health and Medical Commission of China. RESULTS: The 41 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied, and the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31-53; range, 10-87 years) and 18 patients (43.9%) were female. All of the patients had recently visited Wuhan or other places (ie, Beijing, Thailand) or had Wuhan-related exposure. Common symptoms included fever (32[78%]) and cough (29[70.7%]). All patients were without hepatitis B/C virus hepatitis. CRP (C-reactive protein, 11.3 mg/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.45-35.2]) was elevated in 22 patients (53.7%), and cardiac troponin I (1.5 ng/mL [IQR, 0.8-5.0]) was elevated in 41 patients (100%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) or GGO with consolidation in the lungs of 27(65.9%) patients. 31(75.6%) patients had an abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG). Comparing the three groups, the levels of CRP and cardiac troponin I, GGO distribution in bilateral lungs, and electrocardiogram changes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Cardiac troponin I had a strong positive correlation with CRP (r = 0.704, p = 0.042) and LDH (r = 0.738, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Significant differences among the groups suggest that several clinical parameters may serve as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission. Elevated cTnI could be considered as a predictor of severe COVID-19, reflecting the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19.

We tried to assess the consequences of one of these precautionary measures, namely the interruption of a 4/6 cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDK4/6i) in metastatic patients with clinical benefit (complete response/partial response and patients with stable disease for at least 6 months) on endocrine treatment (ET). The main reason for this interruption was to limit the risk of myelosuppression (assumed as a serious risk factor for COVID-19) and other adverse effects that could overlap with symptoms and clinical signs described in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We included 60 patients (median age: 64 years old) in whom the CDK4/6i was stopped during the first COVID-19 outbreak. It was a non-interventional, retrospective, multicentric study. A univariate analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with disease progression: odds ratios (OR) were estimated along with their confidence intervals (CI). Key patient characteristics, all included in the statistical model, are presented in Table 1. Results: The average duration of a CDK4/6i interruption was 8 weeks. During this therapeutic break, 22 (37 %) patients Shad a radiological and/or clinical progression of the disease. Among them, CDK4/6i were taken back for the majority of patients (n=16/22;73 %) when the sanitary situation improved.For four patients (n=4/22;18 %), a new specific treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) was initiated for rapid or symptomatic tumor progression. Two patients died while CDK4/6i was withdrawn. All the results of the univariate analysis are summarized in Table 2. During the CDK4/6i discontinuation, the risk of disease progression was significantly increased in the presence of liver metastases. This was the only variable with a significant effect in univariate analysis. Although not statistically significant, the risk of disease progression was higher when CDK4/6i withdrawal was longer, when patients had a more aggressive breast cancer (Luminal B) and when the tumor was considered as resistant to ET. Conclusions: The importance of maintaining the cell cycle inhibitor in addition to ET does not seem to be debatable as 36 % of patients progressed during CDK4/6i withdrawal. This is important in clinical practice when the question of CDK4/6i discontinuation arises for other reasons (analgesic radiotherapy or programmed surgery for example). Special attention should be paid to patients with liver metastases for whom stopping such a treatment seems to accelerate the natural course of the disease.","output":"Consequences of stopping a 4/6 cyclin D-dependent kinase Inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer patients with clinical benefit on endocrine treatment, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Despite the aggressive marketing of electronic nicotine device systems (ENDS) as smoking cessation tools, the evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to determine the effect of ENDS on cigarette smoking cessation, as compared with other types of nicotine replacement therapies (NRT). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, the CENTRAL Trials Registry of the Cochrane Collaboration using the Ovid interface, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform trials registries were searched through 17 June 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials in which any type of ENDS was compared with any type of NRT, in traditional cigarette users. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The primary outcome was smoking cessation, defined as abstinence from traditional cigarette smoking for any time period, as reported in each included study, regardless of whether abstinence is self-reported or biochemically validated. Secondary outcomes included smoking reduction, harms, withdrawal and acceptance of therapy. A random-effect model was used, and data were pooled in meta-analyses where appropriate. RESULTS: Six studies were retained from 270. Most outcomes were judged to be at high risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was graded as low or very low. Pooled results showed no difference in smoking cessation (rate ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.09), proportion of participants reducing smoking consumption (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.98), mean reduction in cigarettes smoked per day (mean difference 1.11, 95% CI ?0.41 to 2.63), or harms (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.20), between groups. CONCLUSION: We found no difference in smoking cessation, harms and smoking reduction between e-cigarette and NRT users. However, the quality of the evidence was low.

Main outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke and late revascularization and their combinations as major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE): MACCE-1 included cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke; MACCE-2 was MACCE-1 plus late revascularization. Survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between the type of treatment and outcomes. Results All-cause death was lower in participants submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (0.41, 0.16-1.03, P=0.057) compared to medical treatment (MT). Coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) had an overall trend for poorer outcomes: cardiovascular death 2.53 (0.42-15.10), combined cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke 2.15 (0.73-6.31) and these events plus late revascularization (2.17, 0.86-5.49). The corresponding numbers for PCI were 0.27 (0.05-1.43) for cardiovascular death, 0.77 (0.32-1.84) for combined cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke and 2.35 (1.16-4.77) with the addition of late revascularization.

The aim of this work was to describe the clinical appearance of SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive patients and to determine the SARS-CoV-2 contact risk for health care workers (HCW). METHODS: The retrospective study included n = 2283 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from n = 1725 patients with otorhinolaryngological (ORL) diseases performed from March to November 2020 prior to inpatient treatment. In addition, demographic data and medical history were assessed. RESULTS: n = 13 PCR tests (0.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rate showed a significant increase during the observation period (p < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical symptoms that led to a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 before PCR testing. The patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had symptoms that were interpreted as symptoms typical of the ORL disease or secondary diagnoses (n = 9).

We used radiofrequency ablation to treat the vascular pedicle of exophytic AML with low R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score and investigated its feasibility for hilar off-clamping nephron-sparing surgery. METHODS Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed enhanced, well-defined lipomatous tumors with a maximum diameter of 4-8 cm in the kidney of 15 patients. Results indicated that the exophytic tumors featured in the enlarged tumor vasculatures extended into the parenchyma of the involved kidney. The patients underwent radiofrequency ablation by using a Cool-tip? probe placed into the root of the AML mass from different directions under laparoscopic ultrasonography guidance. After sealing the vascular pedicle of the tumor, the bloodless tumors were resected en bloc without renal hilar clamping or suturing the resection defect of the kidney. RESULTS All patients underwent the procedure smoothly, and no perioperative complications occurred. The contrast-enhanced CT scan showed small defects in the contrast-enhanced renal parenchyma at third month after the procedure, and the decrease in function of the treated kidneys was <10% during the 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience suggests that sealing the tumor vessels by radiofrequency ablation based on the tumor vasculature features of a renal mass is an alternative to hilar clamping in laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery. Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation and tumor excision are a definitive and safe minimally invasive procedure that allows the successful removal of exophytic sporadic AML mass with low R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score.","output":"Laparoscopic Radiofrequency Ablation Combined with Surgical Excision for Exophytic Renal Angiomyolipoma: A Novel Technique Based on Tumor Vasculature Features of Enhancing Renal Masses Toward Hilar Off-Clamping Nephron-Sparing Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has restricted the physical activity of the population, but maintaining exercise could reduce the risk of contracting the infection itself and mitigate the effects of quarantine.","output":"Exercise in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Responses from the H1N1 swine flu pandemic and the recent COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic provide an opportunity for insight into the role of health authorities ways of communicating health risk information to the public. We aimed to synthesise the existing evidence regarding different modes of communication used by health authorities in health risk communication with the public during a pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a rapid scoping review. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for publications in English from January 2009 through October 2020, covering both the full H1N1 pandemic and the response phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search resulted in 1440 records, of which 48 studies met our eligibility criteria. RESULTS: The present review identified studies across a broad interdisciplinary field of health risk communication. The majority focused on the H1N1 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. A content analysis of the studies identified three categories for modes of communication: i) communication channels, ii) source credibility and iii) how the message is communicated. The identified studies on social media focused mainly on content and engagement, while studies on the effect of the use of social media and self-protective behaviour were lacking. Studies on the modes of communication that take the diversity of receivers in the field into account are lacking. A limited number of studies of health authorities use of graphic and audio-visual means were identified, yet these did not consider/evaluate creative communication choices. CONCLUSION: Experimental studies that investigate the effect of health authorities videos and messages on social media platforms and self-protective behaviour are needed. More studies are needed across the fields of health risk communication and media studies, including visual communication, web design, video and digital marketing, at a time when online digital communication is central to reaching the public.

METHODS: Patients with ESRD (ESRD group; n = 52) and healthy controls (HC group; n = 44) were recruited. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. The differential metabolites in the GCF and serum were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Inflammatory markers including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also assessed. RESULTS: In the ESRD group, IL-8 and CRP were significantly higher in GCF, whereas IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in serum, compared with HC group (all P < 0.05). In the case of GCF, taurine levels were positively correlated with IL-8 levels in both groups (all P < 0.05). In the case of serum, l-phenylalanine and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid levels were positively correlated with CRP levels in both groups (all P < 0.05). Significant positive correlations were observed between metabolites (including pseudouridine, l-phenylalanine, and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and IL-6 levels only in ESRD group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and CRP are potential inflammatory makers that reflect the periodontal health of ESRD individual, which may be considered the valuable predictive diagnostics in the agreement with PPPM philosophy. Besides, metabolites of taurine in GCF as well as l-phenylalanine and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in serum are possible biomarkers correlated with inflammatory markers.

Information regarding infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objectives To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2. Study Design This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020. Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate > 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation  93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen <300 and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease. The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms. Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, p=0.01). For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was performed in 20% of cases, the rate of ARDS was 70%, and re-intubation was necessary in 20%. There was one case of maternal cardiac arrest, but no cases of cardiomyopathy and no maternal deaths. Thirty-two (50%) women in this cohort delivered during their COVID-19 hospitalization (34% of severe and 85% of critical women). Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of pregnant women with critical COVID-19 who delivered during their disease course were delivered preterm, 94% of them via cesarean; in all, 75% (15/20) of critically ill women delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths, or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical). Critically ill women had a high rate of ARDS, and there was one case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy, or maternal mortality. Hospitalization for severe or critical COVID-19 infection resulted in delivery during the course of infection in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.

We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health. There were also notable differences in psychological outcome; Hong Kong, with very strict social distancing protocols plus ongoing political unrest, suffered the most drastic deterioration of mental health.

Moreover, we investigated if factors such as: personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, safety guidelines or access to psychiatric and psychological support at the workplace, correlated with the level of psychological distress experienced by personnel.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among personnel of LTCF in Poland. The survey consisted of the sociodemographic section, the authors questionnaire with questions related to COVID-19 exposure, working conditions, access to PPE and mental health services, GHQ Questionnaire-28.Resultsshow that access to PPE (P= .018), to workplace safety guidelines (P= .031), psychological support at workplace (P<0.01), fixed shift schedule (P= .05) and feeling that the right number of staff are employed in the workplace (P= .009), were related to the lower severity of psychopathological symptoms evaluated with the GHQ-28.ConclusionsThe study indicates an evidence that LTCF personnel are susceptible to the development of anxiety, depression, insomnia and social dysfunction during the pandemic crisis.

In addition, impacts of substitution mutations on stability and glycosylation patterns of these proteins were studied. In comparison of physiochemical features of membrane and RNA polymerase proteins, only instability index of membrane protein was difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Mutation analysis showed increase in stability of RNA polymerase and decrease in stability of membrane protein in SARS-CoV-2. Glycosylation pattern analysis showed glycosylation enhancement in both membrane and RNA polymerase proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV.

In order to determine the longrun implications of these factors, and for purposes of retaining estimates efficiency and consistency in the presence of complex errors, we employed the Panel-Corrected-Standard-Error estimator on panel data spanning 2003C2018 for 30 SSA countries. The main result of this in-depth analysis shows that infrastructure development as well as governance are key to manufacturing production. While infrastructure development affects MVA positively in the longrun, an improvement in the financial openness facilitates this linkage but only between transport infrastructure on the one hand, and electricity infrastructure on the other, whereas the converse appears the case when trade liberalization is the moderating variable. Overall, regardless of the type of liberalization, manufacturing output is always higher with better institutional quality. Our findings hold after controlling to additional covariates and are robust to alternative estimation measures. Among the other important policy derivatives of our findings, we emphasize that efforts aimed at reversing Africas pervasive infrastructure deficit, in ways that enhance manufacturing share in GDP, must be carefully nuanced under the avoidance of the incautious liberalization policies.

Treated cells were infected with PRRSV; MARC-145 cells incubated with Ad5-Blue supernatants developed cytopathic effects (CPE), whereas those incubated with swIFN-beta showed no CPE. To confirm the antiviral activity of swIFN-beta, culture fluids from Ad5-swIFN-beta-infected cells were affinity-purified on a Sepharose-anti-swIFN-beta matrix, and the resulting fractions exhibited antiviral activity upon infection with PRRSV.

In this paper, we aimed to design a framework for building a disease model for COVID-19 based on current literature evidence. The model was set up by identifying the molecular pathophysiology related to the COVID-19 phenotypes, collecting the mechanistic knowledge scattered across scientific literature and bioinformatic databases, and integrating it using a logical/conceptual model systems biology. The model framework building process began from the results of a domain-based literature review regarding a multiomics approach to COVID-19.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019-2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations.

Antigenic and molecular characterization of influenza strains confirmed the good matching between circulating and 2010/11 vaccine viruses.","output":"Impact of influenza during the post-pandemic season: epidemiological picture from syndromic and virological surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionIndividuals with Long Covid represent a new and growing patient population. In England, fewer than 90 Long Covid clinics deliver assessment and treatment informed by NICE guidelines. However, a paucity of clinical trials or longitudinal cohort studies means that the epidemiology, clinical trajectory, healthcare utilisation and effectiveness of current Long Covid care are poorly documented, and that neither evidence-based treatments nor rehabilitation strategies exist. In addition, and in part due to pre-pandemic health inequalities, access to referral and care varies, and patient experience of the Long Covid care pathways can be poor. In a mixed methods study, we therefore aim to: (1) describe the usual healthcare, outcomes and resource utilisation of individuals with Long Covid; (2) assess the extent of inequalities in access to Long Covid care, and specifically to understand Long Covid patients experiences of stigma and discrimination. Methods and analysisA mixed methods study will address our aims. Qualitative data collection from patients and health professionals will be achieved through surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, to understand their experience and document the function of clinics. A patient cohort study will provide an understanding of outcomes and costs of care. Accessible data will be further analysed to understand the nature of Long Covid, and the care received.

Since this if the first-year interviews were held entirely virtual for a (NRMP) match season, we sought to determine: (1) How did program directors (PDs) in this year's fellowship conduct their virtual interviews? (2) Were any of these conduct decisions associated with the PD satisfaction with the resulting match? (3) What is the PDs opinion of how interviews should occur next year if COVID-19 is not a factor? DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors sent an anonymous survey to the PDs of all programs participating in the 2021 colon and rectal surgery residency match directly following match day 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one colon and rectal residency PDs (70% response rate) responded to the survey (78% Male) representing a range of experience (Ma?=a?7.61, SDa?=a?5.66, years as PD at current institution), and program type (77.5% Academic, 7.5% Independent Academic Medical Center, 15% Nonacademic). RESULTS: While programs utilized several different platforms, conducted various forms of training for their faculty, and provided applicants with different types of information, interview day(s) across the specialty are reported to have proceeded smoothly. PDs as a whole were very satisfied with their match results this year (Ma?=a?4.65, SDa?=a?.66), and this satisfaction was not impacted by virtual interview decisions or processes. However, only 55% of PDs agree or strongly agree that next year's interviews should be virtual regardless of COVID-19, a judgement solely influenced by the opinion of other program faculty on virtual interviews, regardless of satisfaction with match or comfort with technology.

Participants completed the Chinese versions of the General Information Questionnaire, the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. RESULTS A total of 149 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The median total hospice care attitudes score was median 102.00(interquartile range, 95.5-120.50). The nurses' attitudes toward hospice care were significantly associated with their age, knowledge of hospice care, level of empathy, and self-efficacy.

Currently surgical resection of the affected lung parenchyma is the gold standard of treatment. However, as patients are becoming medically more complex and presenting with more advanced disease, minimally invasive image guided percutaneous ablations are gaining popularity. Therefore, comparison of surgical, ablative, and second-line external beam therapies will help clinicians, as management of NSCLC changes. We will conduct a meta-analysis, reviewing literature investigating these therapies in adult patients diagnosed with Stage I NSCLC (tumor ranging from 0-5 cm, with no hilar nor mediastinal nodal involvement, confirmed either through cytology or histology regardless of type). Methods and Analysis: We will search electronic databases from their inception to January 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and cohort studies comparing the survival and clinical outcomes between any two interventions (lobectomy, wedge resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation and consolidated radiation therapies (EBRT, SBRT and 3D-CRT). The primary outcomes will include: cancer-specific survival (CSS), lung disease free survival, locoregional recurrence, death, toxicity, and non-target organ injury. In addition to the electronic databases, we will search for published and unpublished studies in trial registries and will review the references of included studies for possible inclusion in this review. Risk of bias will be assess using tools developed by the Cochrane collaboration. Two reviewers will independently assess the eligibility of studies and conduct the corresponding risk-of-bias assessments. For each outcome, given a sufficient number of studies, we will conduct a network meta-analysis. Finally, we will use the Confidence in Network meta-analysis (CINeMA) tool to assess the quality of the evidence for each of the primary outcomes. Ethics and Dissemination: We aim to share our findings through high-impact peer review. As interventional techniques become more popular, it will be important for all providers in multi-disciplinary teams focused on care of these patients to receive continuing medical education on related to these interventions.

Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72 hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the clinical treatment in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%).

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.","output":"LONG-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN SURVIVORS OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAKS AFTER HOSPITALISATION OR ICU ADMISSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FOLLOW-UP STUDIES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Comparison of primary anastomosis (PA) and Hartmann's procedure (HP) in perforated diverticulitis is biased as the patient groups are different in age, comorbidity and severity of disease. Still, PA has been advocated as the procedure of choice. The aim of this study was to compare the two surgical procedures after eliminating this selection bias using a propensity score model. METHOD Sixty-five HP and 46 PA patients who underwent emergency laparotomy for perforated diverticulitis were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression using the Mannheim peritonitis index, Colorectal Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity, Charlson comorbidity index and Hinchey score was performed to determine the propensity score. RESULTS Patients with HP had significantly higher scores, median age and were more often on immunosuppressive medication. Unadjusted logistic regression for outcome showed a significant risk of HP vs PA for nonsurgical morbidity (odds ratio 3.25, 95% CI: 1.26-8.43; P = 0.015), but not for mortality and surgical morbidity. After adjusting for the propensity score, outcome was not significantly different. Patients with PA had a clinical leak rate of 28% and none of the patients with leakage had a protective ileostomy. Patients with PA and leak had higher Charlson scores whereas all other scores were similar to nonleak patients. CONCLUSION The theory that PA is generally superior to HP cannot be supported. HP remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in perforated diverticulitis, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.

To assist with this goal, we estimated the aggregate costs of immunization programs for ten vaccines in 94 low- and middle-income countries from 2011 to 2030. METHOD: We calculated vaccine, immunization delivery and stockpile costs for 94 low- and middle-income countries leveraging the latest available data sources. We conducted scenario analyses to vary assumptions about the relationship between delivery cost and coverage as well as vaccine prices for fully self-financing countries. RESULTS: The total aggregate cost of immunization programs in 94 countries for 10 vaccines from 2011 to 2030 is $70.8 billion (confidence interval: $56.6-$93.3) under the base case scenario and $84.1 billion ($72.8-$102.7) under an incremental delivery cost scenario, with an increasing trend over two decades. The relative proportion of vaccine and delivery costs for pneumococcal conjugate, human papillomavirus, and rotavirus vaccines increase as more countries introduce these vaccines. Nine countries in accelerated transition phase bear the highest burden of the costs in the next decade, and uncertainty with vaccine prices for the 17 fully self-financing countries could lead to total costs that are 1.3-13.1 times higher than the base case scenario.

Interestingly, in the CLP model, mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice efficiently cleared the bacteria despite an impaired recruitment of leukocytes, especially mononuclear cells. The increased lethality rate in these models correlates with an impaired production of interleukin (IL) 10 in vivo. Furthermore, macrophages from mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice activated with lipopolysaccharide also produced lower amounts of IL-10 and similar tumor necrosis factor compared with wild-type mice. We observed a drastic increase in the amounts of macrophage migration inhibitory factor at 6 and 24 h after CLP in mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice.

It is however unclear, whether patients who received the basic immunization prior to anti-B cell medication start respond to the COVID-19 booster dose, once B cells are depleted. AIM: To investigate the humoral response to recall antigen by COVID-19 booster vaccines in people with MS (pwMS), who recently started an anti-CD20 therapy compared to people with long-term B cell depletion. METHODS: We enrolled 15 pwMS who had received booster vaccination on anti-CD20 therapy. Of these, 11 had established anti-CD20 medications and were therefore vaccinated during a continuous state of B cell depletion (CD20-vaccine cohort). Four pwMS had received the basic immunization prior to anti-CD20 therapy commencement and only the booster dose (vaccine-CD20-vaccine cohort) under conditions of B cell depletion. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses after booster vaccination among both groups and evaluated accompanying B cell numbers and proportions from the peripheral circulation. RESULTS: The booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited measurable antibody responses in 18% of individuals from the CD20-vaccine cohort compared to 100% from the vaccine-CD20-vaccine cohort. Antibody-levels were significantly higher among patients from the vaccine-CD20-vaccine cohort compared to the CD20-vaccine cohort (mean 951.25  1137.96 BAU/ml, vs mean 12.36  11.94 BAU/ml; mean difference 938 BAU/ml (95% CI: 249C1629 BAU/ml), p <0.0001). Among the vaccine-CD20-vaccine cohort, the booster immunization led to augmentation of spike antibody levels in 75% despite concomitant B cell depletion, and values increased by 3.8 C 9.4-fold compared to basic immunization. We observed no correlation of B cell kinetics and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

In addition to recession and high unemployment, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that stressors associated with a pandemic can cause increased strains, including difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and decreased mental health (CDC, 2020). Two general frameworks that explain these stressor-strain relationships over time include stress-reaction and adaptation models. Stress-reaction models suggest that stressors, such as heightened job demands due to the pandemic, accumulate over time and thus prolonged exposure to these stressors results in both immediate and long-term strain; conversely, adaptation models suggest that people adapt to stressors over time, such that strains produced by ongoing stressors tend to dissipate. After controlling for county-level COVID-19 cases, we found that (a) workers in general exhibited decreasing cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms over time, providing support for the adaptation model; (b) on-site workers experienced increasing physical fatigue over time, supporting the stress-reaction model among those workers; and (c) engaging in recovery behaviors was associated with improvements in cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms for all workers.

COVID-19 has devastated global economy, public health, social interaction, and has claimed millions of lives globally within a few months. Due to the severe effect of some of the instituted guidelines on citizens and the economy, some of the policies in place to curtail the spread were receded. Hence, the present review aims to assess existing literature on the knowledge and adherence of Africans toward the COVID-19 preventive measures. Methods: Studies focused on Africans' knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures were selected using Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Preprints that have not been peer-reviewed, reviews, and non-COVID-19 studies were excluded. Results: All selected studies showed a satisfactory knowledge of respondents about COVID-19 but poor level of adherence to the preventive measures. Good knowledge and satisfactory level of adherence was common mostly among the clinical health workers, highly educated, and those with higher professional qualification, while poor knowledge and poor practice was observed mostly among rural dwellers, people of poor educational background, and those unable to read and write. Conclusion: This review identified a relatively good knowledge about COVID-19 from all the studies, however, the level of adherence to preventive measures was poor. We recommend that the populace adhere to the laid guidelines to ensure the spread of the virus is curbed while also enhancing the eradication of the pandemic.","output":"Knowledge and Adherence to COVID-19 Preventive Measures: A Continental Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus.

There is currently no marker of immunosuppression that can be used to predict the COVID-19 vaccination response. Here, we study whether torque tenovirus (TTV), a highly prevalent virus can be used as an indicator of immunosuppression. METHODS: : The humoral response to the mRNA 1273 vaccine was assessed in 103 LTR, who received a transplant between 4 and 237 months prior to vaccination, by measuring Spike (S)-specific IgG levels at baseline, 28 days after first, and 28 days after the second vaccination. TTV loads were determined by RT-PCR and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to correlate serological responses to TTV load. RESULTS: : Humoral responses to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in 41/103 (40%) LTR at 28 days after the second vaccination. 62/103 (60%) were non-responders. Lower TTV loads at baseline (significantly) correlated with higher S-specific antibodies and a higher percentage of responders. Lower TTV loads also strongly correlated with longer time since transplantation, indicating that participants with lower TTV loads were longer after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: : This study shows a better humoral response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in subjects with a lower TTV load pre-vaccination. In addition, TTV load correlates with the time after transplantation. Further studies on the use of TTV load in vaccination efficacy studies in immunocompromised cohorts should provide leads for the potential use of this marker for optimizing vaccination response.","output":"High Torque tenovirus (TTV) load before first vaccine dose is associated with poor serological response to COVID-19 vaccination in lung transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES As periodontal disease preponderates in adults, early detection and interventional regime is urgently needed.

Methods Intraocular pressure was raised in rat eyes by injecting 2M hypertonic saline into the limbal veins. SNC-121 (1 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to the animals for 7 days. Retinas were collected at days 7 and 42, post-injury followed by measurement of HDAC activities, mRNA, and protein expression by enzyme assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results The visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) were declined in ocular hypertensive animals, which were significantly improved by SNC-121 treatment. Class I and IIb HDACs activities were significantly increased at days 7 and 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. The mRNA and protein expression of HDAC 1 was increased by 1.33  0.07-fold and 20.2  2.7%, HDAC 2 by 1.4  0.05-fold and 17.0  2.4%, HDAC 3 by 1.4  0.06-fold and 17.4  3.4%, and HDAC 6 by 1.5  0.09-fold and 15.1  3.3% at day 7, post-injury.

Mitigating the impacts of misinformation is particularly acute across Africa, where WhatsApp and other forms of social media dominate, and where the dual threats of misinformation and COVID-19 threaten lives and livelihoods. Given the scale of the problem within Africa, we set out to understand (i) the potential harm that misinformation causes, (ii) the available evidence on how to mitigate that misinformation and (iii) how user responses to misinformation shape the potential for those mitigating strategies to reduce the risk of harm. METHODS: We undertook a multi-method study, combining a rapid review of the research evidence with a survey of WhatsApp users across Africa.

Patients' demographic and clinical data recorded and analysed are the following: age, gender, previous ocular history, aetiology, symptoms onset, type of symptoms, discharge diagnosis, urgency and severity of diagnosis. RESULTS: OED consultations dropped from 20.6  7.3 visits/day of the COVID-free period to 8.6  4.6 visits/day of the COVID-period. In the COVID-period patients waited longer before physically going to the OED, lamented more vision loss and less redness and reported a higher percentage of traumatic events when compared to the COVID-free period. A significant reduction of ocular surface conditions occurred, while vitreo-retinal disorders increased. Overall, both urgency and severity of diagnosed diseases raised significantly in the COVID-period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic drove a significant reduction of the overall OED activity.

A main limitation of current source detection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network, which is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called patient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new framework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework (SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the first hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact network other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then explore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test queries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be asymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is to find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible. We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is more data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic agents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic agents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art adaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF, even though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network. Extending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate the probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our analytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on the Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the first time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset.","output":"Source Detection via Contact Tracing in the Presence of Asymptomatic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Building back better\\" in the post-COVID-19 Anthropocene era requires novel ideas and ways of working to truly challenge \\"business as usual\\" and contribute to urgently needed systems transformations.

The aim of the study was to compare the length of hospital stay, use of mechanical ventilation and mortality in the TCZ group versus the NON TCZ group. Results The average age of our patients was 62,05 years (13.51) and 62.61 years (16.33) respectively in the TCZ versus NON TCZ group. 76 (76%) were men while 24 were women (24%) in the TCZ group;and there was 313 (68.49%) men and 144 (31.51%) women in the NON TCZ group. Their average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (4.52) in the TCZ group versus 27.89 kg/m2 (4.73) in the NON TCZ group. Among them, the TCZ group included 38 (38%) diabetic patients, 38 hypertensive (38%), 12 heart disease (12%) and 2 chronic renal failure (2%), white the NON TCZ group regrouped 35 (7.65%) diabetics, 33 (7.22%) hypertensive, 12 heart disease (2.67%), and 5 chronic renal failure (1.09%) patients. The mean time to consultation of patients was almost similar in the two groups: 8.86 (7,28) days for TCZ and 8.83 (7,03) days for NON TCZ. The mean length of ICU hospital stay was 9 days (4,94) for the TCZ group and 8,75 days (4,73) for the other one. The saturation at admission was at 74.92% (10.45) for the TCZ group ranging from 40% to 92%, and at 73,56% for the NON TCZ group. Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 12%, severe in 32%, and critical in 56% of TCZ group enrolled cases. Meanwhile it was extensive in 23.63%, severe in 41,35%, and critical in 35,01% of the NON TCZ group. The biological findings found average of white blood cells at 12256/12082 e/mm3;lymphocytes at 761/842 e/mm3;CRP at 181/199 mg/L;ferritin at 1747/528 g/L;and fibrinogen at 6.92/6.27 g/L for the TCZ group versus NON TCZ group. Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. The TCZ group received at least 1 course of Tociluzimab dosed at 400 mg (2 patients received 2 doses and 1 patient received 3 doses). The indication of a Tociluzimab course in our department was based on a set of arguments: an increase in oxygen requirements, a progression of lesions on chest-computed tomography and an increase in markers of inflammation, including IL-6, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The invasive mechanical ventilation was indicated for 4 (4%) patients in the TCZ group versus 192 (42,01%) in the NON TCZ. Among the 100 patients included in our cohort in the TCZ group, 40% died in intensive care unit and 60% had a favorable evolution with a decrease of the biological markers of inflammation. However, in the NON TCZ group, 197 (43,10%) passed away. Conclusion The use of Tociluzimab in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not contribute to a significant difference in the reduction in hospital stay. However, the invasive mechanical ventilation was less needed in patients receiving Tociluzimab than the other. Moreover, there was a mortality benefit associated with the use of Tociluzimab, but only before 10 days of hospitalization.","output":"Benefits of Tocilizumab in patients with a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience of the intensive care unit of the Mohammed VI university hospital, Oujda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe emergence of each novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) requires investigation of its potential impact on the performance of diagnostic tests in use, including Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). Although anecdotal reports have been circulating that the newly emerged Omicron variant is in principle detectable by Ag-RDTs, few data on sensitivity are available. MethodsWe have performed 1) analytical sensitivity testing with cultured virus in eight Ag-RDTs and 2) retrospective testing in duplicates with clinical samples from vaccinated individuals with Omicron (n=18) or Delta (n=17) breakthrough infection on seven Ag-RDTs. FindingsOverall, we have found large heterogenicity between Ag-RDTs for detecting Omicron. When using cultured virus, we observed a trend towards lower sensitivity for Omicron detection compared to earlier circulating SARS-CoV-2 and the other VOCs. When comparing performance for Delta and Omicron in a comparable set of clinical samples in seven Ag-RDTs, 124/252 (49.2%) of all test performed showed a positive result for Omicron compared to 156/238 (65.6%) for Delta samples. Sensitivity for both Omicron and Delta between Ag-RDTs was highly variable. Four out of seven Ag-RDTs showed significantly lower sensitivity (p<0.001) to detect Omicron when compared to Delta while three had comparable sensitivity to Delta. InterpretationSensitivity for detecting Omicron is highly variable between Ag-RDTs, necessitating a careful consideration when using these tests to guide infection prevention measures. While analytical and retrospective testing may be a proxy and timely solution to generate performance data, it is not a replacement for clinical evaluations which are urgently needed. Biological and technical reasons for detection failure by some Ag-RDTs need to be further investigated.

Authorities are exploring complimentary approaches to monitor this infectious disease at the community level. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal wastewater are being implemented worldwide as an environmental surveillance approach to inform health authority decision-making. Owing to the extended excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool, WBE can surveil large populated areas with a longer detection window providing unique information on the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that are unlikely to be screened by clinical testing. Herein, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 63) from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia from 24th of February to 1st of May 2020. A total of 21 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 135 to 11,992 gene copies (GC)/100 mL of wastewater. Detections were made in a Southern Brisbane WWTP in late February 2020, up to three weeks before the first clininal case was reported there. Wastewater samples were generally positive during the period with highest caseload data. The positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater while there were limited clinical reported cases demonstrates the potential of WBE as an early warning system to identify hotspots and target localised public health responses, such as increased individual testing and the provision of health warnings.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA monitoring in wastewater as a potential early warning system for COVID-19 transmission in the community: A temporal case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, nonspecific immunoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and other acute respiratory infections (ARI), which can worsen the course of COVID-19, is increasingly in demand in addition to specific immunization. BCG vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. BCG and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between BCG, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides (MPs) and NOD2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for ARI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, MPs have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. MPs and peptidoglycans containing MPs determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). MPs were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. MPs determine the NOD2-dependent ability of BCG to induce trained immunity. Probably, MPs provide NOD2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) as a NOD2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that MPs, in particular GMDP, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of BCG and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing ARI during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.","output":"[BCG, muramylpeptides, trained immunity (part II): a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for prevention of respiratory infections during a pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses, in general, have several transmembrane proteins and glycoproteins, which assist the virus in entry and attachment onto the host cells. These proteins also play a significant role in determining the shape and size of the newly formed virus particles. The lipid membrane and the embedded proteins affect each other in non-trivial ways during the course of the viral life cycle. Unravelling the nature of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 {degrees}C. While temperature induced fluctuations should be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 {degrees}C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low temperature behaviour. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~30 to 40 {degrees}C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.","output":"How does temperature affect the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 M proteins?

In particular, we propose a penalized (LASSO) regression with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a latecomer in terms of the other countries that were at a similar stage of the pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases and deaths in those countries, we forecast through an adaptive rolling-window scheme the number of cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to Brazil, and show that (so far) it has been performing very well.

METHODS: We present retrospective analysis of masked rtCGM in 30 patients with severe COVID-19. rtCGM was used during the first 24 hours for comparison with arterial-line point of care (POC) values, where clinicians utilized rtCGM data to adjust insulin therapy in patients if rtCGM values were within 20% of point-of-care (POC) values during the masked period. An investigator-developed survey was administered to assess nursing staff (n = 66) perceptions regarding the use of rtCGM in the ICU. RESULTS: rtCGM data were used to adjust insulin therapy in 30 patients. Discordance between rtCGM and POC glucose values were observed in 11 patients but the differences were not considered clinically significant. Mean sensor glucose decreased from 235.7  42.1 mg/dL (13.1  2.1 mmol/L) to 202.7  37.6 mg/dL (11.1  2.1 mmol/L) with rtCGM management. Improvements in mean sensor glucose were observed in 77% of patients (n = 23) with concomitant reductions in daily POC measurements in 50% of patients (n = 15) with rtCGM management. The majority (63%) of nurses reported that rtCGM was helpful for improving care for patients with diabetes patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 49% indicated that rtCGM reduced their use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: From 12 to 21 May 2020, an online survey was sent to all undergraduate health students and interns in the KSA. This included questions on demographics, volunteering status, risk perception of COVID-19, as well as motivations and barriers towards volunteering. RESULTS: In a convenience sample of 6016 students and interns across KSA, 1824 (30.31%) have volunteered with the MOH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteering was more likely among older participants, from the College of Medicine, those with self-perceived at risk of COVID-19 infection and those with self-perceived healthy participants. Females, those who did not think that students had moral duties to volunteer, those who were at risk of seasonal influenza and those with self-perceived at risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 were less likely to volunteer. Patriotism, gaining experience, assisting when able and religious rewards all were reported as major motivators to volunteer. Non-volunteering participants reported that lack of interest, protocol and knowledge, as well as issues related to their personal health and transportation were the main barriers to volunteering.

Methods: Descriptive study of the challenges faced in eye banking during the lockdown, and practices adopted to overcome the critical aspects in the clinical care of patients who presented with emergency corneal diseases requiring keratoplasty. Results: Complete lockdown orders from the Indian government, as a strategy to control the Coronavirus pandemic, resulted in drastic reduction of all types of elective corneal transplants and eye banking activities from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The sudden cessation of eye banking resulted in an acute demand and supply imbalance of fresh donor corneas for transplants during this time. Our network of eye banks addressed this issue by adopting glycerol preservation of donor corneas, which were subsequently utilized for tectonic penetrating keratoplasty. The donor cornea retrieval was resumed in a strategized manner 3 weeks prior to the date of exit of the lockdown, with modified guidelines on donor suitability, screening, retrieval, processing, and harvesting from various sources. A triage of keratoplasty priority was formulated to tide over the post lockdown shortage of corneas.

METHODS: The reports of suspected adverse drug reactions were extrapolated from the National Network of Pharmacovigilance. Data from Italy, the Campania Region, and the Local Health Unit Naples 3 South were compared. A retrospective qualitative analysis of demographics data, clinical status, suspected drugs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) description and its degree of seriousness were collected. RESULTS: We observed 1071 ADRs, of which 281 were serious; of these, 39 led to hospitalization, 779 were not serious, and 2 caused death. In the pre-pandemic period, chemotherapy drugs most frequently induced ADRs. The year 2020, in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, saw a clear reduction in the number of drug reports, compared to 2019 and 2021, both at national and regional level, and at ASL Napoli 3 Sud. A reduction in 2020 that ranges from -40.75% to -72.56% at the national and regional level, respectively; reaching as much as -88.13% at the local level in the health authority under analysis.

CONCLUSIONS: The covid-19 pandemic has affected the trend in the number of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. This is for several reasons: first, frontline exposed health care workers have been able to devote less time to pharmacovigilance activities to cope with the health emergency, second, since the start of the covid-19 vaccination campaign, health care workers have been more focused on reporting suspected adverse reactions to vaccines.

RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001) significantly correlated with cardiac injury, whereas sex (p = 0.372) and coexisting diseases did not. Rising procalcitonin (p = 0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (p < 0.001), interleukin 6 (p = 0.001), interleukin 10 (p < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor &#945; (p = 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), white blood cells (p < 0.001), neutrophils (p = 0.001), declining lymphocytes (p < 0.001), and natural killer cells (p = 0.005) were associated with cardiac injury and showed predictive ability in the multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age and inflammatory factors influence cardiac injury in elderly patients. Interfering with inflammation in this patient population may potentially confer cardiac protection.","output":"Cardiac injury is associated with inflammation in geriatric COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fluvoxamine is widely prescribed as an antidepressant. Recent studies show the drug may have a clinical benefit in treating COVID-19. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the existing randomized trials of fluvoxamine compared with placebo on the early treatment of COVID-19 patients. We included only randomized clinical trials enrolling ambulatory patients with early-stage disease (symptoms > 7 days) for the prevention of hospitalization. We searched MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov databases to identify trials and extract data with clarifications from the study investigators. We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses via R to evaluate the pooled estimate of hospitalization. We included three randomized trials: STOP COVID 1 and 2, and the TOGETHER Trial. The studies included a total of 2,196 patients. The STOP COVID trials measured clinical deterioration whereas the TOGETHER Trial measured hospitalization as the primary outcome. All trials reported on hospitalization up to day 28. The meta-analysis results show that patients receiving fluvoxamine were 31% less likely to experience clinical deterioration or hospitalization compared with placebo (risk ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88). A sensitivity analysis using the definition of hospitalization resulted in a risk reduction of 21% (95% CI, 0.60-1.03). Data from three randomized controlled trials show that fluvoxamine was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome measure (either clinical deterioration or composite outcome of hospitalization or extended emergency setting observation), although analysis of hospitalization-only was not statistically significant.

To better understand Arb mechanism of action, we investigated its interactions with phospholipids and membrane peptides. We demonstrate that Arb associates with phospholipids in the micromolar range. NMR reveals that Arb interacts with the polar head-group of phospholipid at the membrane interface. Fluorescence studies of interactions between Arb and either tryptophan derivatives or membrane peptides reconstituted into liposomes show that Arb interacts with tryptophan in the micromolar range. Interestingly, apparent binding affinities between lipids and tryptophan residues are comparable with those of Arb IC50 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) membrane fusion. Since tryptophan residues of membrane proteins are known to bind preferentially at the membrane interface, these data suggest that Arb could increase the strength of virus glycoprotein's interactions with the membrane, due to a dual binding mode involving aromatic residues and phospholipids. The resulting complexation would inhibit the expected viral glycoprotein conformational changes required during the fusion process. Our findings pave the way towards the design of new drugs exhibiting Arb-like interfacial membrane binding properties to inhibit early steps of virus entry, i.e., attractive targets to combat viral infection.","output":"Mechanism of Inhibition of Enveloped Virus Membrane Fusion by the Antiviral Drug Arbidol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid abuse and related overdose deaths continue to rise in the United States, contributing to the current national opioid crisis.

In response to the opioid crisis, the National Institute on Drug Abuse proposed a list of pharmacological targets of highest priority for medication development for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD). Among these are antagonists of dopamine D3 receptors (D3R). In this review, we first review recent progress in research of the dopamine hypothesis of opioid reward and abuse and then describe the rationale and recent development of D3R ligands for the treatment of OUD.

This classifier is designed for binary classification, assuming one class is surrounded by the other class in very diverse radial directions, which is seen to be typical for our virus detection data. This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance Weighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data set, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear separating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary. Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape of the separating boundary.

However, evidence shows that some communities are less likely to comply with such instructions than others. This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS: Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS: The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION: Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them.

These analyses are particularly important for mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) products. The exquisite responsiveness of MSCs, which makes them attractive candidates for immunotherapies, is a double-edged sword; MSC clinical trials result in inconsistent outcomes that may correlate with underlying patient biology or procedural differences at trial sites. Here we review 45 North American MSC clinical trial results published between 2015 and 2021 to assess whether these reports provide sufficient information for retrospective analysis. Trial reports routinely specify the MSC tissue source, autologous or allogeneic origin and administration route. However, most methodological aspects related to cell preparation and handling immediately prior to administration are under-reported. Clinical trial reports inconsistently provide information about cryopreservation media composition, delivery vehicle, post-thaw time and storage until administration, duration of infusion, and pre-administration viability or potency assessments. In addition, there appears to be significant variability in how cell products are formulated, handled or assessed between trials. The apparent gaps in reporting, combined with high process variability, are not sufficient for retrospective analyses that could potentially identify optimal cell preparation and handling protocols that correlate with successful intra- and inter-trial outcomes. The substantial preclinical data demonstrating that cell handling affects MSC potency highlights the need for more comprehensive clinical trial reporting of MSC conditions from expansion through delivery to support development of globally standardized protocols to efficiently advance MSCs as commercial products.","output":"From Vial to Vein: Crucial Gaps in Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Clinical Trial Reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world. The metabolic disease type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly increases the risk of developing active TB. Effective new TB vaccine candidates and novel therapeutic interventions are required to meet the challenges of global TB eradication. Recent evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a significant role in how the host responds to infection, injury and neoplastic changes. Animal models that closely reflect human physiology are crucial in assessing new treatments and to decipher the underlying immunological defects responsible for increased TB susceptibility in comorbid patients. In this study, using a diet-induced murine T2D model that reflects the etiopathogenesis of clinical T2D and increased TB susceptibility, we investigated how the intestinal microbiota may impact the development of T2D, and how the gut microbial composition changes following a very low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our data revealed a substantial intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in T2D mice compared to non-diabetic animals. The observed differences were comparable to previous clinical reports in TB patients, in which it was shown that Mtb infection causes rapid loss of microbial diversity. Furthermore, diversity index and principle component analyses demonstrated distinct clustering of Mtb-infected non-diabetic mice vs. Mtb-infected T2D mice. Our findings support a broad applicability of T2D mice as a tractable small animal model for studying distinct immune parameters, microbiota and the immune-metabolome of TB/T2D comorbidity.

An essential component of this close relationship between the two is sex differences. Many autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous and multiple sclerosis, feature strikingly increased prevalence in females, whereas in contrast, infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, affect more men than women. Therefore, there are fundamental aspects of metabolic homeostasis and immune functions that are regulated differently in males and females. This can be observed in sex hormone-immune interaction where androgens, such as testosterone, have shown immunosuppressive effects whilst estrogen is on the opposite side of the spectrum with immunoenhancing facilitation of mechanisms. In addition, the two sexes exhibit significant differences in metabolic regulation, with estrous cycles in females known to induce variability in traits and more pronounced metabolic disease phenotype exhibited by males. It is likely that these differences underlie both the development of metabolic and autoimmune diseases and the response to current treatment options. Sexual dimorphism in immunometabolism has emerged to become an area of intense research, aiming to uncover sex-biased effector molecules in the various metabolic tissues and immune cell types, identify sex-biased cell-type-specific functions of common effector molecules, and understand whether the sex differences in metabolic and immune functions influence each other during autoimmune pathogenesis.

Methods: 993 participants were recruited from three workplaces in South Wales: a food factory, a non-food factory and a call centre. Participants completed a questionnaire and received lateral flow point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. The data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression, both using complete records only and following multiple imputation . Results: The sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ranged from 4% (n=17/402) in the non-food factory to 10% (n=28/281) in the food factory (OR 2.93;95% CI 1.26 to 6.81).

Targeting the increased vimentin expression on liver cells by hzVSF after infection with HBV or woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) was demonstrated initially. Thereafter, hzVSF safety was assessed in eight woodchucks na?ve for WHV infection. Antiviral efficacy of hzVSF was evaluated subsequently in 24 chronic WHV carrier woodchucks by monotreatment with three ascending doses and in combination with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). Consistent with the proposed blocking of WHV reinfection, intravenous hzVSF administration for 12 weeks resulted in a modest but transient reduction of viral replication and associated liver inflammation. In combination with oral TAF dosing, the antiviral effect of hzVSF was enhanced and sustained in half of the woodchucks with an antibody response to viral proteins. Thus, hzVSF safely but modestly alters chronic WHV infection in woodchucks; however, as a combination partner to TAF, its antiviral efficacy is markedly increased.

A multi-omics approach to cancer prevention by spinach (SPI) was pursued for the first time in the polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) model. SPI fed for 26 weeks (10% w/w, freeze-dried in the diet) exhibited significant antitumor efficacy and, in the Apc-mutant genetic background, -catenin remained highly overexpressed in adenomatous polyps. However, in both wild type and Apc-mutant rats, increased gut microbiome diversity after SPI consumption coincided with reversal of taxonomic composition. Metagenomic prediction implicated linoleate and butanoate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pathways in cancer, which was supported by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Thus, tumor suppression by SPI involved marked reshaping of the gut microbiome along with changes in host RNA-miRNA networks. When colon polyps were compared with matched normal-looking tissues via metabolomics, anticancer outcomes were linked to SPI-derived linoleate bioactives with known anti-inflammatory/ proapoptotic mechanisms, as well as N-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate, consistent with altered butanoate metabolism stemming from increased -diversity of the gut microbiome. In colon tumors from SPI-fed rats, L-glutamate and N-acetylneuraminate also were reduced, implicating altered mitochondrial energetics and cell surface glycans involved in oncogenic signaling networks and immune evasion. In conclusion, a multi-omics approach to cancer prevention by SPI provided mechanistic support for linoleate and butanoate metabolism, as well as tumor-associated changes in L-glutamate and N-acetylneuraminate.

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether this flight to safety effect can be observed during the COVID-19 crisis, which is considered to be a one-of-a-kind crisis and obviously of different origin compared to previous (financial) crises. By examining the interactions between the (option-implied) volatilities of the stock market (VIX) and of the gold (GVZ) and oil (OVX) markets, the main findings indicate that there is a granger causality in general between the equity market and the gold as well as the oil market. During the COVID-19 crisis, a stronger influence of the equity market on the oil market can be observed. Based on symmetric causality tests that are typically employed in the literature, this cannot be observed for the gold market. However, once we control for asymmetric causal interactions, we find that positive shocks in VIX cause positive shocks in GVZ. Hence, the typical flight to safety effect, similar to the one observed during other (financial) crises can also be identified for the COVID-19 crisis. The causality between the equity and oil market is triggered by political factors as well as the economic impact of the crisis which induces a sharp drop in demand for oil.","output":"Is this time really different?

METHODS: We conducted a search of media articles specific to three EDs in Canada, published between January 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019. Media items (N = 368) were coded by story and theme attributes. A thematic analysis was completed to understand how writers in public media present issues pertaining to nursing practice within the ED context. RESULTS: Two overarching themes were found. First, in ED-related media that portrays health care needs of people experiencing health and social inequities, messaging frequently perpetuates stigmatizing discourses. Second, media writers portray pressures experienced by nurses working in the ED in a way that evades structural determinants of quality of care. Underlying both themes is an absence of perspectives and authorship from practicing nurses themselves.
