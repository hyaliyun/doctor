Recent studies have suggested that dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which carry sensory neural signals from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system, are important for pathological nociception. A proper understanding of the significance and function of DRG and their role in pharmacotherapy can help to improve the treatment of neuropathic pain. Metamizole, also known as sulpyrine or dipyrone, is a non-opioid analgesic commonly used in clinical practice, but it is not used for neuropathic pain treatment. METHODS Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve was induced in Wistar rats. Metamizole was administered intraperitoneally (ip) preemptively at 16 and 1 h before CCI and then twice a day for 7 days. To evaluate tactile and thermal hypersensitivity, von Frey and cold plate tests were conducted, respectively. RESULTS Our behavioral results provide evidence that repeated intraperitoneal administration of metamizole diminishes the development of neuropathic pain symptoms in rats. Simultaneously, our findings provide evidence that metamizole diminishes the expression of pronociceptive interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, and CCL7) in DRG measured 7 days after sciatic nerve injury. These assays indicate, for the first time, that metamizole exerts antinociceptive effects on nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain at the DRG level. CONCLUSIONS Finally, we indicate that metamizole-induced analgesia in neuropathy is associated with silencing of a broad spectrum of cytokines in DRG. Our results also suggest that metamizole is likely to be an effective medication for neuropathic pain.","output":"Metamizole relieves pain by influencing cytokine levels in dorsal root ganglia in a rat model of neuropathic pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, new technologies, such as microarrays or high-performance sequencing, are producing more and more genomic data [...].","output":"Computational Methods for the Analysis of Genomic Data and Biological Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Emergency Department in Trondheim has prepared for a large influx of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS: In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION: There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.","output":"Pasienttilstr?mming i et akuttmottak i p?vente av covid-19-pandemien./ Pasienttilstr?mming i et akuttmottak i p?vente av covid-19-pandemien./ Patient visits to an emergency department in anticipation of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amy Griffin and co-authors discuss unstable housing and the response to HIV/AIDS in the United States.","output":"Addressing disparities in the health of persons with HIV attributable to unstable housing in the United States: The role of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pedra Branca Forest is located in a highly-urbanised region of the central portion of Rio de Janeiro City, comprises the largest urban forest on the continent and is isolated from other Atlantic Forest remnants.

The potential for a future pandemic originating from animal reservoirs or health care-associated events is a major public health concern. There are no vaccines or therapeutic agents currently available for MERS-CoV. Using a probe-based single B cell cloning strategy, we have identified and characterized multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specifically binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 (non-RBD) regions from a convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patient and from immunized rhesus macaques. RBD-specific MAbs tended to have greater neutralizing potency than non-RBD S1-specific MAbs. Six RBD-specific and five S1-specific MAbs could be sorted into four RBD and three non-RBD distinct binding patterns, based on competition assays, mapping neutralization escape variants, and structural analysis. We determined cocrystal structures for two MAbs targeting the RBD from different angles and show they can bind the RBD only in the \\"out\\" position. We then showed that selected RBD-specific, non-RBD S1-specific, and S2-specific MAbs given prophylactically prevented MERS-CoV replication in lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge. Importantly, combining RBD- and non-RBD MAbs delayed the emergence of escape mutations in a cell-based virus escape assay. These studies identify MAbs targeting different antigenic sites on S that will be useful for defining mechanisms of MERS-CoV neutralization and for developing more effective interventions to prevent or treat MERS-CoV infections.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes a highly lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or antiviral therapeutic options are currently available. Based on continuing exposure from established reservoirs in dromedary camels and bats, transmission of MERS-CoV into humans and future outbreaks are expected. Using structurally defined probes for the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S), the target for neutralizing antibodies, single B cells were sorted from a convalescent human and immunized nonhuman primates (NHPs). MAbs produced from paired immunoglobulin gene sequences were mapped to multiple epitopes within and outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and protected against lethal MERS infection in a murine model following passive immunization. Importantly, combining MAbs targeting distinct epitopes prevented viral neutralization escape from RBD-directed MAbs. These data suggest that antibody responses to multiple domains on CoV spike protein may improve immunity and will guide future vaccine and therapeutic development efforts.","output":"Importance of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Multiple Antigenic Sites on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein To Avoid Neutralization Escape."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to defend the need of taking a pan-European and international collective action to tackle as rapidly, efficiently and effectively as possible the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19, addressing, specifically, the ethical and legal issues of the international sharing of personal data On the whole, intending to improve international cooperation in medical and scientific research with personal data Copyright ? 2020 Mikel Recuero Linares","output":"The international sharing of personal data concerning health in times of the COVID-19: Ethical and legal issues for the impulse of a necessary cooperation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists regarding use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in spontaneously breathing patients. We evaluated the effectiveness of continuous iNO via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19 respiratory failure. METHODS: We performed a multicenter cohort study of patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with HFNC. Patients were stratified by administration of iNO via HFNC. Regression analysis was used to compare the need for mechanical ventilation and secondary endpoints including hospital mortality, length of stay, acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy, and need for extracorporeal life support. RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were identified and 66 (24.3%) of these patients received iNO via HFNC for a median of 88 h (interquartile range: 44, 135). After 12 h of iNO, supplemental oxygen requirement was unchanged or increased in 52.7% of patients. Twenty-nine (43.9%) patients treated with iNO compared to 79 (38.3%) patients without iNO therapy required endotracheal intubation (P = .47). After multivariable adjustment, there was no difference in need for mechanical ventilation between groups (odds ratio: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-3.17), however, iNO administration was associated with longer hospital length of stay (incidence rate ratio: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.31-1.51). No difference was found for mortality, acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy, or need for extracorporeal life support. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, iNO delivered via HFNC did not reduce oxygen requirements in the majority of patients or improve clinical outcomes.

The literature and the media abound in examples of transportation planning failures including decisions made, delayed or withdrawn without any traceable motivations, public opposition, public opposition, extra costs/implementation times and outright cancellation, wrong traffic/revenue forecasts. Planning failures stem from several causes, including technical errors in forecasting predictable effects, lack of consensus, new governance cycles and inability to recognize the intrinsic uncertainty affecting some key variables. The underlying assumption of this paper is that the quality of the decision-making process critically depends on how the process is structured and managed. The paper proposes a conceptual model to represent and organize transport planning as a cognitive decision-making process with strong involvement of different stakeholders in various stages, accounting for different levels of uncertainty and including short- and long-term decisions options. The result is a planning process that allows for changes in objectives, strategies and decisions during different stages of the process itself, as is usually the case when different governance and socio-economic cycles succeed over time. However, the process maintains a form of procedural consistency and is intended to counteract the Penelope syndrome, whereby decisions made under previous governance cycles are undone regardless of their merits and costs. The real-life implementation of the proposed model requires strong political commitment to an open and accountable decision-making process, a technical structure able to act as process owner coordinating technical and engagement activities, and a general societal attitude towards organized participation to public decision making. The proposed model was applied to the Regional Transportation Plan of Veneto in Italy where the above conditions applied. A number of lessons were learnt from that exercise: i) stakeholders engagement revealed an important potential to manage uncertainty and increase consensus;ii) flexibility and robustness with respect to mediumCtoChigh uncertainty levels already recognized at the time of the plan (immediately before the COVID-19 crisis) were an appreciated feature of the plan;iii) separation between mature decisions and those needing further analysis was a success strategy, reducing political decision costs (from naysaying) by delaying decisions still recognizing underlying needs;iv) reduced decision time (a largely bi-partisan vote in less than one year).","output":"A cognitive participative decision-making model for transportation planning under different uncertainty levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus infection causes seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, leading to huge morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Blood transfusion was offered in order to improve her weakness and shortness of breath that developed due to the severe anemia, but the patient (along with her family) refused such treatment. During the 17 days of hospitalization, it was a continuous struggle between the transplant team, patient, and family for her to continue with the recovery process; at times we had even considered that performing the transplant had been a mistake. While organ transplantation can be performed safely in Jehovah's Witnesses, there are multiple factors seen in this particular case that warrant analyzing: (I) the potential use of stricter transplant exclusionary criteria, given the recipient's advanced age and preexisting co-morbidities, which likely increased her risk of developing severe anemia post-operatively, and (II) the recipient's emotional/psychological post-operative state of high anxiety, which developed while she was experiencing the severe anemia; in hindsight, her anxiety level may have been reduced if we had offered daily post-operative psychological counseling sessions. While the patient's allograft is currently doing well, we probably did not have strict enough criteria for proper selection of a JW candidate for kidney transplantation.","output":"Deceased donor kidney transplant in a 70-year-old Jehovah's Witness patient: to transplant or not to transplant-a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines whether sports betting markets are semistrong-form efficienti.e., whether new information is rapidly and completely incorporated into betting prices.

The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of stress and its associated factors among primary healthcare nurses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 Saudi nurses in the government primary health care centers in Medina city, Saudi Arabia. Stress was measured by the stress subscale of the 21-Item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Sources of stress were assessed by 15 items. RESULTS: The majority were females (68.0%) and aged less than 40 years (72.5%). Thirty percent had severe or very severe stress. Stress was associated significantly with the presence of chronic diseases (P = 0.037) and with working in night shifts (P = 0.042). All sources of stress in the workplace were associated significantly and positively with stress (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: About one-third of the participants had stress.

To date, there are no studies that compared the disease severity of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with nontransplant patients. METHODS In this case-control study, we compared the outcomes of COVID-19 between SOT recipients and their matched nontransplant controls. The cases were all adult SOT recipients (N=41) from our academic health center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/10/20 and 5/15/20 using positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2. The controls(N=121) were matched on age(5years), race, and admission status (hospital or outpatient). The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were severe disease, intubation and renal replacement therapy(RRT). RESULTS Median age of SOT recipients(9-heart, 3-lung, 16-kidney, 8-liver, 5-dual-organ) was 60 years, 80% were male and 67% were Black. Severe disease adjusted risk of death was similar in both the groups(HR=0.84[0.32-2.20]). Severity of COVID-19 and intubation were similar but the RRT use was higher in SOT (OR=5.32[1.26, 22.42]) compared to non-SOT COVID-19 patients. Among SOT recipients, COVID-19-related treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with ten-fold higher hazard of death compared to without HCQ (HR=10.62[1.24-91.09]). CONCLUSIONS Although African-Americans constituted one-tenth of all SOT in our center, they represented two-thirds of COVID-19 cases. Despite high RRT use in SOT recipients, the severe disease and short-term death were similar in both groups. HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients was associated with high mortality and therefore, its role as a treatment modality requires further scrutiny.","output":"COVID-19 Outcomes Among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: A Case-Control Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, in some jurisdictions, police have become involved in enforcing coronavirus-related measures. Relatedly, several North American jurisdictions have established COVID-19 data sharing protocols with law enforcement.

This disease was seen typically in the sinonasal form in COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes, steroid use in COVID-19 treatment, etc. were some of the postulated risk factors for the association of COVID 19 and Mucormycosis. The management plan of these cases included surgical debridement, systemic antifungal therapy, sugar control, and management of antifungal related systemic adverse effects. In this retrospective case record review, we aimed to evaluate the airway management plan, demographics, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing surgical resection for COVID-19 associated mucormycosis. Forty-one (71.9 %) patients had a diagnosis of sino-nasal mucormycosis, fourteen (24.6%) had a diagnosis of rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and 2 patients (3.5%) were diagnosed with palatal mucormycosis. Total 44 (77.19 %) patients had co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidity was Diabetes Mellitus 42 (73.6%), followed by hypertension 21 (36.84%) and Acute kidney injury 14 (28.07%). We used the intubation difficulty scale score to assess intubating conditions. Intubation was easy to slightly difficult in 53 out of 57 patients. In our study, mortality occurred in 7 (12.28 %) patients. The median mortality time was 60 (range, 27-74) days. The median time to hospital discharge was 53.5 (range,10-85) days.

The purpose of this manuscript is to review a multi-institutional clinical experience in 200 consecutive patients at 29 hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO. Methods This analysis includes our first 200 COVID-19 patients with complete data who were supported with and separated from ECMO. These patients were cannulated between March 17 and December 9, 2020. Differences by mortality group were assessed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests and Welchs ANOVA for continuous variables. Results Median ECMO time was 15 days (IQR=9-28). All 200 patients have separated from ECMO: 90 patients (45%) survived and 110 patients (55%) died. Survival with veno-venous ECMO was 87 of 188 patients (46.3%), while survival with veno-arterial ECMO was 3 of 12 patients (25%). Of 90 survivors, 77 have been discharged from the hospital and 13 remain hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors had lower median age (47 versus 56 years, p<0.001) and shorter median time interval from diagnosis to ECMO cannulation (8 days versus 12 days, p=0.003).In the 90 survivors, adjunctive therapies on ECMO included: intravenous steroids (64), Remdesivir (49), convalescent plasma (43), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (39), prostaglandin (33), and hydroxychloroquine (22). Conclusions ECMO facilitates survival of select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger and have a shorter duration from diagnosis to cannulation.

Even as we continue to consider the ramifications of the pandemic, we must also grapple with natural hazards C large-scale meteorological and geological events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, blizzards, wildfires, earthquakes, extreme heat, and drought C that will inevitably wreak havoc during our long recovery. Some consequences of these disasters are well-known: loss of life, economic catastrophe, and destruction of homes. Perhaps less well-known are the threats to the historic and cultural sites that speak to human identity and create a sense of connection across generations. A hurricane or earthquake could destroy completely an old building, especially one that has not been structurally reinforced. Extreme heat and intense precipitation can weaken joints, erode paint or other protections, and bring mold, reducing the lifespan of historic materials. Climate change, exacerbated by man, has made many of these events more frequent and more intense. Given the increasing risks to historic sites, one might think that disaster-related planning, mitigation, and recovery efforts are being undertaken with increased urgency. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This Essay argues that legal reforms at the intersection of disaster law and historic preservation law are desperately needed to protect historic places before they succumb to flame, water, wind, or the earth itself. It starts by explaining whats at stake: archaeological sites, vulnerable buildings, and even threatened national landmarks like Mesa Verde and the Statue of Liberty. It then establishes the three stages where disaster-related legal protection of historic resources is needed: before, during, and after disaster. The Essay next critiques the multi-governmental, federalist framework for heritage-related disaster planning, and highlights two states and four local governments starting to make necessary reforms. While no physical or legal intervention will ever be able to make historic sites last forever, we should try to make them more resilient to the avoidable consequences of obvious threats by changing the laws that render them vulnerable.","output":"Law's Disaster: Heritage at Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State space models, including compartmental models, are used to model physical, biological and social phenomena in a broad range of scientific fields. A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the user's needs. These packages provide guarantees on reproducibility and performance, allowing the user to focus on the model itself, rather than the underlying computation. The ability to automatically generate high-performance code that would be tedious and time-consuming to write and verify manually, particularly when adding further structure to compartments, is crucial for infectious disease modellers. Our packages have been critical to the development cycle of our ongoing real-time modelling efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the potential to do the same for models used in a number of different domains.","output":"Reproducible parallel inference and simulation of stochastic state space models using odin, dust, and mcstate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Urgent guidance is needed on the safety for providers of percutaneous tracheostomy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate that percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) with a period of apnea in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 is safe and can be performed for the usual indications in the ICU. We hypothesize that the usual indications for tracheostomy including prolonged mechanical ventilation, high sedative requirements, and copious secretions apply to patients with COVID-19 and thus this diagnosis should modify tracheostomy technique but not change clinical indications. DESIGN: Observational case series SETTING: Single center medical intensive care unit at a Level-1 Trauma center PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were assessed for tracheostomy MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Success of a modified technique included direct visualization of tracheal access by bronchoscopy and a blind dilation and tracheostomy insertion during a period of patient apnea to reduce aerosolization. Secondary outcomes include transmission rate of COVID-19 to providers and patient complications. RESULTS: From April 6th, 2020 to July 21st, 2020, 2,030 patients were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, 615 required ICU care (30.3%), and 254 patients required mechanical ventilation (12.5%). The mortality rate for patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 29%. 18 patients were assessed for PDT and 11 (61%) underwent the procedure. The majority had failed extubation at least once (72.7%) and the median duration of intubation prior to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 13-24). The median PEEP at time of tracheostomy was 10.8. The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio on the day of tracheostomy was 142.8 (IQR 104.5-224.4). Two patients had bleeding complications. At 1 week follow-up 8 patients still required ventilator support (73%). At the most recent follow-up 8 patients (73%) have been liberated from the ventilator, 1 patient (9%) died as a result of respiratory/multi-organ failure, and 2 were discharged on the ventilator (18%).

METHODS Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during 3 consecutive winter seasons (November-March) from 2007 to 2010. Sixteen sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and B. pertussis.

CONCLUSION: Malakoplakia occurred throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with most of the cases located in the sigmoid colon and rectum (n = 10); other sites included the transverse and descending colon (n = 4), stomach/gastroesophageal junction (n = 4), appendix (n = 2), cecum (n = 1), small bowel (n = 1), and the peri-anal area (n = 1). Endoscopically, these lesions most commonly appeared as polyps (n = 10) or masses (n = 5), other clinical endoscopic impressions varied from a thickened area/fibrosis to mucosal erythema.

Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (ORMortality=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.7x10E-13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic.

RESULTS: Of total, 86.19% of participants were female; 86.67% were aged under 55 years; 11% were physicians and 64.19% were nurses or auxiliaries; 77.62% have themselves tested positive for Covid\\\\19; and 67.94% of CHWs have directly treated patients with Covid\\\\19. 49.28% had clinical depression; over half (58.57%) had clinical anxiety; 70.95% had clinical stress; and 28.57% had clinical insomnia. Increased use of tranquilizers/sedatives appears to be an explanatory variable of suffering greater anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia, and of having a worse HRQoL amongst our CHWs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that symptomatology of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia and HRQoL were affected amongst CHWs during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"Evaluation of the mental health of care home staff in the Covid\\\\19 era.

To this day, the extent to which the red blood cell (RBC) antigens expressed by an individual can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or clearance remains unknown. Methods: The phenotypes for ABO and RhD and the genotypes for 37 red blood cell (RBC) antigens were determined using high throughput platforms in 90 Caucasian convalescent plasma donors. The antigen frequencies were compared to the expected Caucasian frequencies using Z-tests for two-proportion. Results: The AB phenotype and FY*A genotype frequencies were both independently and significantly increased (1.5x, p=0.018 and 2.2x, p=0.028, respectively) in the convalescent cohort (N=90) compared to reference frequencies. The AB phenotype was also significantly overrepresented (3.2x, p=0.028) within the FY*A sub-group (N=23). The O group was underrepresented within the cohort proportionally to the AB increase, although non-significantly (p=0.110). No other significant RBC antigen expression patterns in the convalescent Caucasian population were identified.

Mutations in the Spike surface protein of the virus are regularly observed in the new variants, potentializing the emergence of novel viruses with different tropism from the current ones, which may change the severity and symptoms of the disease. Growing evidence has shown that mutations are being selected in favor of variants that are more capable of evading the action of neutralizing antibodies. In this context, the most important factor guiding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is its interaction with the hosts immune system. Thus, as current vaccines cannot block the transmission of the virus, measures complementary to vaccination, such as the use of masks, hand hygiene, and keeping environments ventilated remain essential to delay the emergence of new variants.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a digital research recruitment registry to optimize awareness and participant enrollment for COVID-19-related research in Baltimore and to report preliminary results. METHODS: Planning began in March 2020, and the registry launched in July 2020. The primary recruitment mechanisms include electronic medical record data, postcards distributed at testing sites, and digital advertising campaigns. Following consent in a Research Electronic Data Capture survey, participants answer questions related to COVID-19 exposure, testing, and willingness to participate in research.

The COVAX Facility seeks to address this important issue, but the prevalence of vaccine nationalism threatens to limit the ability of the facility to meet both its funding targets and its ambitious goals for vaccine procurement. A failure to adequately address the underlying lack of infrastructure in developing countries threatens to further limit the success of the COVAX Facility. CONTEXT: Significant effort has been directed toward developing a COVID\\\\19 vaccine, which is viewed as the route out of the pandemic. Much of this effort has coalesced around COVAX, the multilateral initiative aimed at accelerating the development of COVID\\\\19 vaccines, and ensuring they are equitably available in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries (LMICs). This paper represents the first significant analysis of COVAX, and the extent to which it can be said to have successfully met these aims. METHODS: This paper draws on the publicly available policy documents made available by the COVAX initiatives, as well as position papers and public statements from governments around the world with respect to COVID\\\\19 vaccines and equitable access. We analyze the academic literature regarding access to vaccines during the H1N1 pandemic. Finally, we consider the WHO Global Allocation System, and its principles, which are intended to guide COVAX vaccine deployment. FINDINGS: We argue that the funding mechanism deployed by the COVAX Pillar appears to be effective at fostering at\\\\risk investments in research and development and the production of doses in advance of confirmation of clinical efficacy, but caution that this represents a win\\\\win situation for vaccine manufacturers, providing them with opportunity to benefit regardless of whether their vaccine candidate ever goes on to gain regulatory approval. We also argue that the success of the COVAX Facility with respect to equitable access to vaccine is likely to be limited, primarily as a result of the prevalence of vaccine nationalism, whereby countries adopt policies which heavily prioritize their own public health needs at the expense of others. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts through COVAX have greatly accelerated the development of vaccines against COVID\\\\19, but these benefits are unlikely to flow to LMICs, largely due to the threat of vaccine nationalism.","output":"International Collaboration to Ensure Equitable Access to Vaccines for COVID\\\\19: The ACT\\\\Accelerator and the COVAX Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2009 H1N1 pandemic and seasonal influenza outbreaks have, at times, overwhelmed capacity in children's hospitals.1 The COVID-19 pandemic is different.

Using data collected in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK), and the four biggest states of the United States (US) in April 2020, we find that the financial effects (represented by employment and income change) and nonfinancial effects (represented by experiencing negative nonfinancial effects including mental health issues and enjoying positive benefits) caused by nonpharmaceutical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 are associated with individual subjective well-being. Moreover, positive benefits could reduce the likelihood of becoming unhappy for those who have experienced negative nonfinancial effects or those who have lost their jobs. The results also suggest that the degree to which people agree with their governments approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is positively correlated with their happiness. The risks associated with the pandemic, however, are only slightly associated with peoples happiness. We also find that the correlation between the above factors and individual well-being varies from country to country.","output":"Individual Subjective Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is critical to develop tailored strategies to increase acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and decrease hesitancy.

Later in the hospital course, his pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure worsened as result of severe acute mitral valve regurgitation secondary to direct valvular damage from COVID-19 infection. The patient underwent emergent surgical mitral valve replacement. Pathological evaluation of the damaged valve was confirmed to be secondary to COVID-19 infection. The histopathological findings were consistent with prior cardiopulmonary autopsy sections of patients with COVID-19 described in the literature as well as proposed theories regarding ACE2 receptor activity.

Physical tethering of these molecular machines during translocation, in conjunction with their internal architectural features, generates DNA topological strain in the form of template supercoiling. It is known that the build-up of transient excessive supercoiling poses severe threats to genome function and stability and that highly specialized enzymes-the topoisomerases (TOP)-have evolved to mitigate these threats. Furthermore, due to their intracellular abundance and fast supercoil relaxation rates, it is generally assumed that these enzymes are sufficient in coping with genome-wide bursts of excessive supercoiling. However, the recent discoveries of chromatin architectural factors that play important accessory functions have cast reasonable doubts on this concept. Here, we reviewed the background of these new findings and described emerging models of how these accessory factors contribute to supercoil homeostasis. We focused on DNA replication and the generation of positive (+) supercoiling in front of replisomes, where two accessory factors-GapR and HMGA2-from pro- and eukaryotic cells, respectively, appear to play important roles as sinks for excessive (+) supercoiling by employing a combination of supercoil constrainment and activation of topoisomerases. Looking forward, we expect that additional factors will be identified in the future as part of an expanding cellular repertoire to cope with bursts of topological strain. Furthermore, identifying antagonists that target these accessory factors and work synergistically with clinically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors could become an interesting novel strategy, leading to improved treatment outcomes.","output":"Chromatin Architectural Factors as Safeguards against Excessive Supercoiling during DNA Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcriptomic profiling is critical to uncovering functional elements from transcriptional and post-transcriptional aspects.

First, what factors triggered and affected stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia? Second, how does stockpiling affect other food habits and diets? A total of 851 valid responses were received. The results highlight several features of the stockpiling behavior in Serbia. First, food stockpiling behavior is influenced by some sociodemographic variables such as gender and household composition. Second, stockpiling was fueled by several negative emotions such as fear, sadness, and depression. Third, the results confirm that stockpiling in Serbia was not triggered by supply shortages but rather by consumers concerns of obtaining enough food and rising food prices. Finally, food stockpiling was associated with some positive changes such as eating out less (e.g., restaurants/cafeteria), eating more with their family members, and cooking more food.

METHODS: A total of 136 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped according to the presence of hypertension and BPV. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. was analyzed, and BPV was calculated as the coefficient of variation of MAP (MAP(CV)). High BPV was defined as MAP(CV) values above the median. We compared the age, level of C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatinine and in-hospital mortality and investigated the relationship among the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older (70  12 vs. 53  17 years; P < 0.001), had higher levels of CRP (9.4  9.2 vs. 5.3  8.2 mg/dL; P = 0.009), MAP(CV) (11.4  4.8 vs. 8.9  3.2; P = 0.002), and higher in-hospital mortality (19.6% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.013) than those without hypertension. There was a proportional relationship between BPV and age, levels of CRP, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, creatinine and in-hospital mortality (all, P < 0.05).

In this review, possible pathophysiological mechanisms, approaches to diagnosis, recent study results on outcome, and future directions of research are described. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical manifestations of PRES include seizures, headache, visual disturbances, altered mental state, and more rarely hemiparesis or aphasia. Vasogenic edema predominantly occurs in the parieto-occipital region, but lesions affecting formerly called 'atypical' regions such as frontal lobe, cerebellum, or basal ganglia are common. If treated early and adequately, that is by removal of the underlying cause, PRES has a favorable prognosis, but neurological residual symptoms and even mortality can occur, particularly in patients with complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.

METHODS: Home test kits as well as accompanying user instructions were made available to our patients with paediatric IBD that required faecal calprotectin test between 17 April and 12 August 2020. Once the user completed the test, results were automatically uploaded to the result portal and clinical staff were alerted.

While dexamethasone reportedly reduces inflammation and prevents progression to respiratory failure, the appropriate time to administer dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study, where we consecutively enrolled patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who received oxygen and oral dexamethasone (n = 85). We assessed the association between the number of days to the initiation of dexamethasone and the cumulative rate of exacerbation defined as death or initiation of mechanical ventilation within 28 days of symptom onset. RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value from the initiation of oxygen supplementation to that of dexamethasone administration was two days (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 59%), whereas that from oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) < 95% to the initiation of dexamethasone administration was five days (sensitivity, 78%; specificity, 59%). adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index score, time of oxygen supplementation (two or more days), and SpO(2) < 95% (five or more days), Cox regression analysis results showed that delayed dexamethasone administration since the initiation of oxygen supplementation was significantly associated with a higher risk of death or greater need for mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio: 5.51, 95% confidence interval, 1.79C16.91).

A sample of 507 individuals with obesity aged between 18 and 65 years participated in the present study by filling in the online questionnaire, including the validated Arabic version of the modified version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale, the Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, and the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A cluster analysis was performed using the K-mean method to identify and group participants according to their patterns/profiles. A stepwise linear regression was conducted, taking the food addiction score as the dependent variable. Higher levels of uncontrolled eating, emotional eating and stress were significantly associated with higher food addiction score. Belonging to cluster 2 (psychological well-being and cognitive restraint) (B = 14.49) or cluster 3 (moderate psychological distress and cognitive restraint) (B = 6.67) compared to cluster 1 (psychological well-being, appropriate physical activity levels and eating behaviors) was significantly associated with higher food addiction score. The present research revealed that food addiction is significantly associated with higher psychological distress and maladaptive eating behaviors. Higher levels of uncontrolled eating, emotional eating and stress as well as belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were found to be predictors of food addiction in individuals with obesity in the present study. This knowledge could be useful in regard to psychological treatment of obesity and addictive-like eating behavior.","output":"How Does Food Addiction Relate to Obesity?

METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE searches were pertaining to curcumin, properties of curcumin, curcumin in retinal diseases, curcumin in diabetic retinopathy, curcumin in age-related macular degeneration, curcumin in retinal and choroidal diseases, curcumin in retinitis pigmentosa, curcumin in retinal ischemia reperfusion injury, curcumin in proliferative vitreoretinopathy and curcumin in current COVID era. RESULTS: In experimental models, curcumin showed its pleiotropic effects in retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes, upregulating HO-1, nrf2 and reducing or inhibiting inflammatory mediators, growth factors and by inhibiting proliferation and migration of retinal endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner in HRPC, HREC and ARPE-19 cells. In age-related macular degeneration, curcumin acts by reducing ROS and inhibiting apoptosis inducing proteins and cellular inflammatory genes and upregulating HO-1, thioredoxin and NQO1. In retinitis pigmentosa, curcumin has been shown to delay structural defects of P23H gene in P23H-rhodopsin transgenic rats. In proliferative vitreoretinopathy, curcumin inhibited the action of EGF in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In retinal ischemia reperfusion injury, curcumin downregulates IL-17, IL-23, NF(K)B, STAT-3, MCP-1 and JNK. In retinoblastoma, curcumin inhibits proliferation, migration and apoptosis of RBY79 and SO-RB50. Curcumin has already proven its efficacy in inhibiting viral replication, coagulation and cytokine storm in COVID era.

Despite growing evidence that MSCs are potent anti-inflammatory mediators that can provide substantial benefits in acute organ injury, there are limited clinical trials utilizing MSCs in acute care settings, such as in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU). OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current state of MSC-based therapeutics and further explores the untapped potential role to treat various acute, life-threating injuries in the ED and ICU. DISCUSSION: All clinical trials using MSCs in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) demonstrated safety. While some also demonstrate clinical efficacy, efficacy data is inconsistent, with some studies limited by sample size, cell integrity and different dosages, necessitating further studies. CONCLUSION: MSCs are potentially promising novel biologic therapeutics for clinical application in AMI, ARDS, sepsis, AKI and COVID-19 that have demonstrated safety in all clinical trials. More rigorous clinical trials are necessary and warranted to determine the efficacy of MSCs as a novel therapeutic in an acute setting, such as the ED.","output":"The role of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells in the acute clinical setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Titanium-based substrates are widely used in orthopedic treatments and hard tissue engineering. However, many of these titanium (Ti) substrates fail to interact properly between the cell-to-implant interface, which can lead to loosening and dislocation from the implant site. As a result, scaffold implant-associated complications and the need for multiple surgeries lead to an increased clinical burden. To address these challenges, we engineered osteoconductive and osteoinductive biosubstrates of chitosan (CS)-cross-linked polyaniline (PANI) nanonets coated on titanium nanotubes (TiO2NTs) in an attempt to mimic bone tissue's major extracellular matrix. Inspired by the architectural and tunable mechanical properties of such tissue, the TiO2NTs-PANI@CS-based biofilm conferred strong anticorrosion, the ability to nucleate hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, and excellent biocompatibility with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). An in vitro study showed that the substrate-supported cell activities induced greater cell proliferation and differentiation compared to cell-TiO2NTs alone. Notably, the bone-related genes (collagen-I, OPN, OCN, and RUNX 2) were highly expressed within TiO2NTs-PANI@CS over a period of 14 days, indicating greater bone cell differentiation. These findings demonstrate that the in vitro functionality of the cells on the osteoinductive-like platform of TiO2NTs-PANI@CS improves the efficiency for osteoblastic cell regeneration and that the substrate potentially has utility in bone tissue engineering applications.","output":"Biomimetic Cell-Substrate of Chitosan-Cross-linked Polyaniline Patterning on TiO2 Nanotubes Enables hBM-MSCs to Differentiate the Osteoblast Cell Type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of COVID-19, peoples demand for using the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for physical health monitoring has increased dramatically The considerable amount of data requires stable, reliable, and real-time transmission, which has become an urgent problem to be solved This paper constructs a health monitoring-enabled IoMT network which is composed of several users carrying wearable devices and a coordinator One of the important problems for the proposed network is the unstable and inefficient transmission of data packets caused by node congestion and link breakage in the routing process Based on these, we propose a Q-learning-based dynamic routing selection (QDRS) algorithm First, a mathematical model of path optimization and a solution named Global Routing selection with high Credibility and Stability (GRCS) is proposed to select the optimal path globally However, during the data transmission through the optimal path, the node and link status may change, causing packet loss or retransmission This is a problem not considered by standard routing algorithms Therefore, this paper proposes a local link dynamic adjustment scheme based on GRCS, using the Q-learning algorithm to select the optimal next-hop node for each intermediate forwarding node If the selected node is not the same as the original path, the chosen node replaces the downstream node in the original path and so corrects the optimal path in time This paper considers the congestion state, remaining energy, and mobility of the node when selecting the path and considers the network state changes during packet transmission, which is the most significant innovation of this paper The simulation results show that compared with other similar algorithms, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the packet forwarding rate without seriously affecting the network energy consumption and delay","output":"Q-Learning-Based High Credibility and Stability Routing Algorithm for Internet of Medical Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most-used food contact materials is stainless steel (AISI 304L or AISI 316L), owing to its high mechanical strength, cleanability, and corrosion resistance.

Their potential roles in growth regulation were further investigated using the selectively bred fast-growing C. gigas variety \\"Haida No.1\\". Expression profiling and in situ hybridization of these insulin-like peptides suggested their distinct tissue-specific expression pattern, with dominant expression in the neural enrichment tissues such as labial palp, visceral ganglia, adductor muscle, and digestive gland. The expressions of insulin-like peptides were significantly altered by food abundance in a gene-specific fashion. The expression of ILP was reduced during fasting and increased after re-feeding, the expression of MIRP3 and ILP7 were generally induced during fasting and down-regulated after re-feeding, while the expression of MIRP3-like was firstly up-regulated and then down-regulated during the fasting and re-feeding process. Furthermore, the expressions of all four insulin-like peptide genes were significantly suppressed at low temperature, in accordance with the growth inhibition. These results indicated that all four insulin-like peptides would play critical but different roles in regulation of growth in the oysters.

Recently, a series of methods has been described that employ intelligent acquisition strategies to increase the efficiency of mass spectrometers to detect target peptides. These methods are based on one of two strategies. First, retention time adjustment-based methods enable intelligent scheduling of target peptide retention times. These include Picky, iRT, as well as spike-in free real-time adjustment methods such as MaxQuant.Live. Second, in spike-in triggered acquisition methods such as SureQuant, Pseudo-PRM, TOMAHAQ, and Scout-MRM, targeted scans are initiated by abundant labeled synthetic peptides added to samples before the run. Both strategies enable the mass spectrometer to better focus data acquisition time on target peptides. This either enables more sensitive detection or a higher number of targets per run.

Associated comorbidities were -assessed, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated. The outcomes including duration of hospitalization, duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of O2 -supplementation were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence of T2DM in symptomatic COVID19 positive patients was 59/303 (=19.5%). Diabetic patients had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiac dysfunction [coronary heart disease (CHD)], and congestive heart failure (CHF). Charlson Comorbidity score was significantly higher in the T2DM patients (2.4 1.6) versus the non-diabetic -patients (0.28  0.8; p: < 0.001). Clinically and radiologically, T2DM patients had significantly higher percentage of pneumonia, severe pneumonia and ARDS versus the non-diabetic patients. Hematologically, diabetic patients had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP), higher absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) and lower counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils compared to non-diabetic patients.

However, promoting long-term maintenance of physical activity in this population has proven to be a challenge. Increasing autonomous motivations (ie, intrinsic, integrated, and identified regulations) for physical activity may facilitate enduring behavior change. Digitally delivered games for health that take a celebratory technology approach, that is, using technology to create new ways to experience valued behaviors and express valued beliefs, may be a useful way to target autonomous motivations for physical activity. Formative research with the target population is needed to design compelling intervention content. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate older adult womens reactions to and thoughts about a photography-based, social media walking game targeting autonomous motivations for physical activity. METHODS: During an individual semistructured interview, a moderator solicited feedback from 20 older adult women (age range 65-74 years) as part of formative research to develop a social media game featuring weekly walking challenges. The challenges were designed to target autonomous motivations for physical activity. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two reviewers conducted thematic content analysis on interview transcripts. RESULTS: We identified 3 overarching themes in qualitative data analysis. These reflected the playful experiences, value, and acceptability associated with the intervention challenges. Generally, participants understood what the challenges were asking them to do, proffered appropriate example responses, and indicated that the challenges would be enjoyable. Participants reported that the intervention content afforded many and varied playful experiences (eg, competition, discovery, exploration, expression, fellowship, humor, nurture, sensation). Further, participants indicated that the intervention increased their motivation for physical activity, occasioned meaningful shifts in perspective, increased their knowledge of various topics of interest, provided an opportunity to create valued connection with others, and provided health-related benefits. Participants suggested the intervention emphasize local history, nature, and cultural events. CONCLUSIONS: The photography-based, social media walking game with relatively simple game mechanics was well received and judged to be apt to bring about a wide variety of emotive experiences. A clear, geographically specific identity emerged as a key driver of interest for intervention content.

Specifically, there have been reports of greater than expected right ventricular (RV) involvement in the post COVID-19 recovery period. However, there are no published data comparing RV dysfunction in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patient cohorts with IHD. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess and compare the prevalence of RV hypokinesis in 2 patient cohorts: patients with COVID-19 related IHD and patients with non-COVID-19 related IHD, based on cardiac MRI findings (CMR). METHODS: An institutional cardiac imaging database was queried for all patients with IHD documented by CMR. Inflammatory heart disease was defined as pericarditis and/or myocarditis using the recently modified Lake Louise criteria, including T1 and T2 relaxation mapping. The prevalence of IHD was evaluated in 2 separate patient cohorts, subjects with COVID-19 related IHD and subjects with non-COVID-19 related IHD. Further assessment of these 2 patients cohorts included the presence of RV hypokinesis. A two-tailed Z-test was used for statistical comparison of the presence of IHD and the presence of RV hypokinesis in these 2 patient cohorts. RESULTS: 62 COVID patients and 6782 non-COVID patients were identified in the imaging database. 53 of the 62 COVID patients (85.5%) had evidence of IHD on CMR study. In contrast, 1273 of the 6782 patients (18.8%) had documented IHD detected by CMR. There was a statistically significant difference between the incidence of IHD in the 2 patient groups (p-value <0.ehab724.01391). Furthermore, of the 53 COVID patients with IHD, 30 (56.6%) showed evidence of RV hypokinesis on CMR. Of the 1273 non-COVID patients with IHD, only 126 (9.9%) showed evidence of RV hypokinesis on CMR. There was a statistically significant difference between the incidence of RV hypokinesis among the 2 groups (p-value <0.ehab724.01391). Details are provided in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the prevalence of IHD in COVID-19 patients is 4 times greater than in patients with a non-COVID etiology, based on CMR imaging findings. Furthermore, the occurrence of RV hypokinesis is 5 times greater in COVID-19 patients than in IHD patients with a non-COVID etiology, also based on CMR findings. These data suggest that CMR imaging is of value in detecting both IHD and RV dysfunction, which are often difficult to detect with other imaging modalities.

Predicted IPs, at multiple locations, are validated using statistically derived (SD) IPs from reported infections on G-trains. This is the first known attempt to validate a coupled WR-CFD approach using reported COVID-19 infections derived from the rail environment.

Additionally, predicted locations of highest and lowest IP, agree with those identified in the statistical analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the distribution of infectious aerosols is non-uniform and dependent on the nature of the ventilation. This suggests that modelling techniques neglecting these differences are inappropriate for assessing mitigation measures such as physical distancing. A range of mitigation strategies were analysed; the most effective being the majority (90%) of passengers correctly wearing high efficiency masks (e.g. N95). Compared to the base case (40% of passengers wearing low efficiency masks) there was a 95% reduction in average IP. Surprisingly, HEPA filtration was only effective for passengers distant from an index patient, having almost no effect for those in close proximity.

Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. We studied systemic viral spread after intranasal infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1 [A/Viet Nam/1203/2004]) in ferrets with or without prior pandemic H1N1pdm09 (A/Mexico/4108/2009) or H3N2 (A/Victoria/361/2011) infection. After intranasal challenge with H5N1 influenza virus, naive ferrets rapidly succumbed to systemic infection. Animals challenged with H5N1 influenza virus greater than 3 months after recovering from an initial H1N1pdm09 infection survived H5N1 virus challenge and cleared virus from the respiratory tract 4 days after infection. However, a prolonged low-level infection of hematopoietic elements in the small bowel lamina propria, liver, and spleen was present for greater than 2 weeks postinfection, raising the potential for reassortment of influenza genes in a host infected with multiple strains of influenza. Animals previously infected with an H3N2 influenza virus succumbed to systemic disease and encephalitis after H5N1 virus challenge. These results indicate prior infection with different seasonal influenza strains leads to radically different protection from H5N1 challenge and fatal encephalitis. IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza is efficiently transmitted from human to human, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. Infection of naive ferrets with H5N1 avian influenza virus causes a rapid and lethal systemic disease. We studied systemic H5N1 viral spread after infection of ferrets with or without prior exposure to either of two seasonal influenza virus strains, H1N1 and H3N2. Ferrets previously infected with H1N1 survive H5N1 challenge while those previously infected with H3N2 die of encephalitis. However ferrets protected from lethal H5N1 infection develop persistent low-level infection of the small intestine, liver, or spleen, providing a nidus for future viral strain recombination. The mechanism by which prior infection with specific strains of seasonal influenza virus protect from lethal H5N1 challenge needs to be elucidated in order to design effective immunization and treatments.","output":"H1N1, but not H3N2, influenza A virus infection protects ferrets from H5N1 encephalitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor/transcription factor that modulates several cellular and immunological processes following activation by pathogen-associated stimuli, though its role during virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1-/-macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.","output":"Murine coronavirus infection activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-independent manner, contributing to cytokine modulation and proviral TCDD-inducible-PARP expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Microvascular thrombosis, as well as arterial and venous thrombotic events, have been largely described during severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Therapeutic anticoagulation has been proposed in critical patients, however mechanisms underlying hemostasis dysregulation remain unclear. Methods: : We explored two independent cross-sectional cohorts to identify soluble markers and gene-expression signatures that discriminated COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Results: : We found that elevated soluble (s) P-selectin at admission was associated with disease severity. Elevated sP-selectin was predictive of intubation and death (ROC AUC = 0.67, p = 0.028 and AUC = 0.74, p = 0.0047, respectively). An optimal cutoff value of 150 NC (normalized concentration) was predictive of intubation with 66% negative predictive value (NPV) and 61% positive predictive value (PPV), and of death with 90% NPV and 55% PPV. Next, an unbiased gene set enrichment analysis revealed that critically ill patients had increased expression of genes related to primary hemostasis. Hierarchical clustering identified ITG2AB , GP1BB , PPBP and SELPLG to be upregulated in a grade-dependent manner. ROC curve analysis for the prediction of mechanical ventilation was significant for SELPLG and PPBP (AUC = 0.8, p = 0.046 for both markers). An optimal cutoff value for PBPP was predictive of mechanical ventilation with 100% NPV and 45% PPV, and for SELPLG was predictive of mechanical ventilation with 100% NPV and 50% PPV. Conclusion: We provide evidence that platelets contribute to disease severity with the identification of sP-selectin as a biomarker for poor outcome. Transcriptional analysis identified PPBP and SELPLG RNA count as biomarkers for mechanical ventilation.

DESIGN: We used an abbreviated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures preprinted or published by 1 June 2020. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled. Thirteen studies investigated international measures, while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Wuhan measures reduced the number of cases exported internationally by 70%C80% and led to important reductions in transmission within Mainland China. Additional travel measures, including flight restrictions to and from China, may have led to additional reductions in the number of exported cases. Few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures did not account for domestic travel measures thus likely leading to biased estimates. CONCLUSION: Travel measures played an important role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

From January 2020, this online pedagogy was inevitably placed to surmount the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures demanded the blended pedagogy into a new online approach, in which the traditional face-to-face teaching to be replaced by synchronous online learning (facilitated by technologies such as Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google Class, Panopto etc.). Meanwhile, to offer opportunities for cognitive participation which allows students to process the learning and be reflective, webinar and innovative performance projects were launched from the concept of flipped classroom and outcome-based education.

AIM We aimed to investigate hospital interventions as risk factors for HAB. METHODS Prospectively through one year, we identified episodes of HAB in a single tertiary hospital. We used a matched incidence density sampled case-control design. Matching on sex and age group, we sampled controls (1:2) from the adult hospital population with ongoing hospitalization for 48 h. Using conditional logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For adjusted ORs (aOR), adjustments were made for length of hospital stay, type and urgency of admission, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score level. FINDINGS From 15th October 2019 through 14th October 2020, we identified 115 incident episodes of HAB and matched them with 230 controls. HAB patients were more often admitted as 'medicine or emergency surgery'-patients (94% vs 87%) and had a longer hospital stay before inclusion (median days 20 vs 12). They were more frequently categorized as having a 'low level comorbidity' (58% vs 39%) but had higher prevalence of haematologic (15% vs 6%) or metastatic cancer (13% vs 10%). Our estimates for central venous catheters were aOR of 3.46 (95% CI 1.92-6.23), haemodialysis; aOR 5.05 (95% CI 1.41-18.06), immunosuppressive treatment including chemotherapy; aOR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.00-2.96).

Material and methods 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. Results The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test.

The retail business have been evolving over the past several decades, accentuated by the evolution and development of digital technologies. Almost all parts of the world have witnessed the changes in consumer behavior, the nature of retail, and reshaping of the high street landscape due to the e-commerce revolution and continued expansion. Especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail platforms powered by digital technology had to be adapted quickly, and it is expected to continue to support this change as consumers and retailers adjust to new normalities. Moreover, retail real estate is intricately linked with the retail sector dynamics. While lockdown and social distance rules have devastating impacts on traditional retail property sector, it may accelerate the evolution process of multi-channel retail and the channel integration role of physical stores and thus, bring in transformations in urban-retail landscape. It is not necessarily leading to an end of high street stores, but it may have a significant impact on retail real estate business.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Aggregate and anonymized data from 15 tertiary cardiac care centers were obtained detailing pre-coronarivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) daily cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Data on pollutants and climate were sought for the same days. Mixed level regression was used to compare the week before vs. after the traffic ban (Fortnight analysis), the 3 days before vs. after (Weekly analysis) and the Sunday before vs. after (Sunday analysis). A total of 8 days of temporary traffic bans were included, occurring between 2017 and 2020, totaling 802 STEMI and 1196 NSTEMI in the Fortnight analysis, 382 STEMI and 585 in the Weekly analysis, and 148 STEMI and 210 NSTEMI in the Sunday analysis. Fortnight and Sunday analysis did not disclose a significant impact of traffic ban on STEMI or NSTEMI (all P > 0.05). Conversely, Weekly analysis showed non-significant changes for STEMI but a significant decrease in daily NSTEMI when comparing the 3 days before the traffic ban with the ban day (P = 0.043), as well as the 3 days before vs. the 3 days after the ban (P = 0.025). No statistically significant effect of traffic ban was found at Fortnight, Weekly or Sunday analyses for daily mean concentrations of benzene, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM) <2.5 m or PM < 10 m (all P > 0.05). However, minimum daily concentrations showed a significant reduction of ozone during the ban in comparison to the week preceding it (P = 0.034), nitric oxide during the ban in comparison to the 3 days preceding it (P = 0.046), and an increase in benzene during the ban in comparison to the Sunday before (P = 0.039).

BACKGROUND Patients with ESRD undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement have an operative mortality approaching 20% and a 10-year survival of approximately 12%. We investigated whether TAVR is a more reasonable option. METHODS This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all patients with ESRD who underwent TAVR in 8 institutions between 12/2011 and 02/2013. Demographic characteristics, mortality, major, and minor complications were evaluated. Outcomes were stratified by operative approach. RESULTS Forty-three patients with a mean age 76.2  11.0 years and a mean STS predicted risk of mortality of 15.53  8.70% underwent TAVR. Mean duration of dialysis was 45.2  52.3 months (median 29.5 months). Transfemoral (TF) TAVR was performed in 31/43 (72.1%), transapical in 11/43 (25.6%), and transaortic in 1/43 (2.3%). Operative mortality was 14.0% (6/43) with TF mortality 6.5% (2/31) and 33.3% (4/12) in non-TF patients. Six-month mortality was 11/43 (25.6%: 16.1% TF, 50.0% non-TF). Complications included stroke in 2.3% (1/43) and life-threatening or major bleeding in 14.0% (6/43). Discharge to another healthcare facility was 27.0% (10/37). Readmission within 30 days of procedure for any cause was 18.9% (7/37). CONCLUSIONS Patients with ESRD who undergo TAVR are at high risk for mortality and complications. TAVR outcomes are comparable to but not substantially better than those with SAVR.

This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We curate an age-stratified cfr dataset with [Formula: see text] 750 k cases and conduct a case study, investigating total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between different countries and at different points in time. This allows us to separate age-related effects from others unrelated to age and facilitates a more transparent comparison of cfrs across countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign reversal of the direct causal effect in mid-March, which temporally aligns with the reported collapse of the healthcare system in parts of the country. Moreover, we find that direct and indirect effects across 132 pairs of countries are only weakly correlated, suggesting that a country's policy and case demographic may be largely unrelated. We point out limitations and extensions for future work, and finally, discuss the role of causal reasoning in the broader context of using AI to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact StatementDuring a global pandemic, understanding the causal effects of risk factors such as age on COVID-19 fatality is an important scientific question. Since randomised controlled trials are typically infeasible or unethical in this context, causal investigations based on observational datasuch as the one carried out in this articlewill, therefore, be crucial in guiding our understanding of the available data. Causal inference, in particular mediation analysis, can be used to resolve apparent statistical paradoxes; help educate the public and decision-makers alike; avoid unsound comparisons; and answer a range of causal questions pertaining to the pandemic, subject to transparently stated assumptions. Our exposition helps clarify how mediation analysis can be used to investigate direct and indirect effects along different causal paths and thus serves as a stepping stone for future studies of other important risk factors for COVID-19 besides age.","output":"Simpson's Paradox in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates: A Mediation Analysis of Age-Related Causal Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores higher education and the ways in which the shutdown caused by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic have accelerated the evolution of online education This movement from face\\\\to\\\\face (F2F) education to a virtual environment was forced and unplanned It can be viewed as a stress test for digital teaching and learning in the higher education system The study addresses course conversions and the progress of online education in response to the current crisis","output":"en/ Online Education in a Pandemic: Stress Test or Fortuitous Disruption?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: We developed a model, updated daily, to estimate undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine following selectively opening New Zealand's borders to travellers from low-risk countries.

The rate of undetected infections entering the border following screening and quarantine was estimated. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries were defined as those with an active COVID-19 prevalence of up to 1/105, 10/105 and 100/105, respectively.

Previous studies (C.-L. Liao and M. C. C. Lai, J. Virol. 68:4727-4737, 1994) have demonstrated that an upstream cis-acting leader sequence serves as a transcriptional enhancer, but the mechanism of transcriptional regulation is not clear. In this study, we constructed a series of defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene behind a differentially expressed transcription initiation (intergenic) sequence (for mRNA2-1). These DI RNAs had different copy numbers of the UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence at the 3' end of the leader. Transfection of these DI RNA constructs into cells infected with a helper MHV, which contains either two or three UCUAA copies at the 3' end of the leader, resulted in differential expression of CAT activities. We demonstrated that the copy number of UCUAA repeats in the leaders of both helper viral and DI RNAs affected the level of CAT activity, suggesting that MHV leader RNA could regulate both in trans and in cis the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. The leader RNA of subgenomic mRNAs was derived from either the trans- or the cis-acting leader. Furthermore, insertion of a UA-rich sequence (UUUAUAAAC) immediately downstream of the leader in DI RNA, to match the sequence of helper viral RNA, enhanced the CAT activity by threefold, suggesting that this nine-nucleotide sequence is a cis-acting element. Interestingly, when the nine-nucleotide sequence was absent in DI RNA, the leaders of subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively derived from the helper virus. In contrast, when the nine-nucleotide sequence was present in DI RNA, the leaders were derived from both helper viral and DI RNAs. These results suggest that the nine-nucleotide sequence either is required for the leader RNA to initiate mRNA synthesis or, alternatively, serves as a transcription terminator for the leader RNA synthesis. However, when a constitutively expressed intergenic sequence (for mRNA7) was used, no difference in transcription efficiency was noted, regardless of the copy number of UCUAA in the DI RNA and helper virus. This study thus indicates that MHV subgenomic RNA transcription requires the interaction among the intergenic (promoter) sequence, a trans-acting leader, and a cis-acting leader sequence. A novel model of transcriptional regulation of coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs is presented.","output":"Coronavirus leader RNA regulates and initiates subgenomic mRNA transcription both in trans and in cis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translational sleep science has become a critical and fundamental focus in the field of behavioral medicine.

METHODS: Five academic databases (Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase) were searched. Observational studies including case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were included if relevant data relationships were reported (i.e., sleep assessed utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or Insomnia Severity Index). All the studies were English, peer-reviewed papers published between December 2019 and February 2021. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020181644. FINDINGS: 168 cross-sectional, four case-control, and five longitudinal design papers comprising 345,270 participants from 39 countries were identified. The corrected pooled estimated prevalence of sleep problems were 31% among healthcare professionals, 18% among the general population, and 57% among COVID-19 patients (all p-values < 0.05). Sleep problems were associated with depression among healthcare professionals, the general population, and COVID-19 patients, with Fisher's Z scores of -0.28, -0.30, and -0.36, respectively.

The World Health Organization and mental health associations have warned that the current COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a drastic increase of stress-related conditions and mental health issues globally. Materials and Methods: An online web-based survey has been launched from 10 to 15 April 2020 in Paraguay in order to collect information regarding the stress related to the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been spread through social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook). Two thousand two hundred and six Paraguayan citizens, over 18 years of age, completed the survey voluntarily. Socio-demographics as well as ratings at Self-perceived Stress Scale have been collected and analyzed. Results: Two thousand two hundred and six subjects (74.12% men) aged between 18 and 75 with an average of 34  11 years old completed the survey. 12.42% (276 subjects) of sample reported a preexisting diagnosis of mental disorder, and 175 participants (7.93%) reported an increase of preexisting symptoms with the onset of COVID-19 quarantine. 41.97% of them had anxiety and 54.38% did not receive any specific treatment. The general population rated 18.10  5.99 at Self-perceived Stress Scale, which indicates a moderate level of self-perceived stress. Significant association was found between higher levels of stress and female sex, being single, or reporting preexisting mental disorder, above all anxiety and depression (p < 0.01). In fact, in 63.87% of mentally ill subjects (n = 175), the quarantine has worsened symptoms of preexisting mental disorders. Conclusion: This study suggests a stressful impact of COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of participants reporting a moderate level of self-perceived stress. We suggest mental health services to provide a phone-based or web-based support to the general population in order to contrast the psychological impact of the pandemic. This approach may improve the accessibility to mental healthcare services in Paraguay, especially in times of social distancing.","output":"Self-Perceived Stress During the Quarantine of COVID-19 Pandemic in Paraguay: An Exploratory Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The incidence of acute myocardial infarction has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but sex and age differences in this change in incidence have not been tested. Thus, we aimed to compare the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in a health-care region in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic with previous years and to evaluate sex and age differences. Methods: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study using data from a national registry of patients admitted to coronary care units in Sweden. All patients admitted to one of three hospitals in Region J?nk?ping County with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to July 31, 2020) or reference period (March 1 to July 31, 2017C19) were included. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation) was calculated for both study periods. Participants were grouped according to sex and age (&lt;70 years vs 70 years). The incidence and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the two study periods was calculated for each group and compared between groups using the Breslow-Day test. Findings: The study included 1088 participants, 846 who were admitted for acute myocardial infarction during the reference period and 242 who were admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The IRR of acute myocardial infarction for the COVID-19 period compared with the reference period was 085 (95% CI 073C098). The IRR for acute myocardial infarction was significantly lower among women aged 70 years or older (056 [040C078]) than among men aged 70 years or older (097 [077C123];p=00074). Interpretation: The incidence of acute myocardial infarction decreased predominantly among women aged 70 years or older during the COVID-19 pandemic. This highlights potential sex differences in health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which should be further elucidated. Funding: None. ? 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant trauma in the nursing population. The lack of preparation, in combination with a substantial loss of life, may have implications for the longer-term mental health of the nursing workforce. Nursing students have, in many cases, been an important part of the emergency response. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in the academic year 2014/15 with data collected at two time points. There was a 7-month time period between data collection. METHODS: Participants completed paper-based questionnaires measuring demographics, academic stressors, clinical stressors, and mental health. 358 nursing students at time point one and 347 at time point two (97% retention) completed the survey. RESULTS: Inadequate preparation (OR: 1.783) and the inadequate preparation x death and dying interaction term (OR: 4.115) significantly increased risk of mental health problems over time. Increased death and dying alone did not increase mental health risk. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that it is not the increase in death and dying per se that causes mental health difficulties, but that it is instead the experience of high levels of death and dying in combination with inadequate preparation. The data are considered within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with both inadequate preparation and the scale of death and dying being two significant stressors during the emergency period.","output":"A Longitudinal Cohort Study Investigating Inadequate Preparation and Death and Dying in Nursing Students: Implications for the Aftermath of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practices worldwide.

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87.

RESULTS: Population density was found to be significantly associated with state-level coronavirus infection and mortality rate (b = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34, 0.64, P < .0001). States that have lower socioeconomic status, lower mean age and denser populations are associated with higher incidence rates.

The aim of our study is to assess the psychological impact of COVID19 pandemic on medical students in Sudan. Methods: and Materials: A cross-sectional descriptive research was done among medical student in Sudan during COVID 19 pandemic in August 2020. DASS-21 scales were used to determine the level of depression, anxiety and stress among medical students through an online questionnaire, their responses were taken relatable to 21 items of DASS scale. The data was analyzed by means of SPPS version 25.0. Results: : The mean (SD) age of our study participants was 21.8 (2.4) with female to male ratio of 2.1. Most of the participants were residing during the time the of the study in middle stats of Sudan (50.8%) and 83% were staying with their families. Interestingly, more than 40.5% of the study participants were free of depression while more than 13% had extremely severe depression. On the other hand, only 4.4% had extremely severe stress. However, anxiety ranked the higher numbers with 23% had extremely severe anxiety. Adjusted linear regression model revealed that lower levels in the medical school and open colleges during the lock down period were associated with more anxiety (p value 0.01,0.006 respectively), while having a family member working in the medical field is associated with less stress (p value 0.02).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper to investigate whether frailty is associated with all-cause mortality in older hospital inpatients, with COVID-19. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Secondary care acute hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included are 677 consecutive inpatients aged 65 years and over. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of frailty with mortality. Frailty was assessed at baseline, according to the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), where higher categories indicate worse frailty. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, previous admissions and acute illness severity. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-four patients were classified according to CFS. Two hundred and seventy-one died, during a mean follow-up of 34.3 days. Worse frailty at baseline was associated with increased mortality risk, even after full adjustment (P = 0.004). Patients with CFS 4 and CFS 5 had non-significant increased mortality risks, compared to those with CFS 1-3. Patients with CFS 6 had a 2.13-fold (95% CI 1.34-3.38) and those with CFS 7-9 had a 1.79-fold (95% CI 1.12-2.88) increased mortality risk, compared to those with CFS 1-3 (P = 0.001 and 0.016, respectively). Older age, male sex and acute illness severity were also associated with increased mortality risk.

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled, i.e., sequencing samples with low viral load often results in insufficient viral reads for analyses. METHODS: We applied a novel multiplex PCR amplicon (amplicon)-based and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 from serials dilutions of a cultured isolate, and eight clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral loads. We also examined and compared the sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. RESULTS: We demonstrated that both amplicon and capture methods efficiently enriched SARS-CoV-2 content from clinical samples, while the enrichment efficiency of amplicon outran that of capture in more challenging samples. We found that capture was not as accurate as meta and amplicon in identifying between-sample variations, whereas amplicon method was not as accurate as the other two in investigating within-sample variations, suggesting amplicon sequencing was not suitable for studying virus-host interactions and viral transmission that heavily rely on intra-host dynamics. We illustrated that meta uncovered rich genetic information in the clinical samples besides SARS-CoV-2, providing references for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Taken all factors above and cost-effectiveness into consideration, we proposed guidance for how to choose sequencing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 under different situations. CONCLUSIONS: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work systematically investigating inter- and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 using amplicon- and capture-based whole-genome sequencing, as well as the first comparative study among multiple approaches. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses.","output":"Multiple approaches for massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly from clinical samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two panelists will elaborate on 'four practical problems and six ethical objections', which add up to one very bad idea, i.e., the 'immunity passport'. Such an idea is equal to restricting movement on the basis of biology threatens freedom, fairness and public health. Lessons from previous pandemics will be examined in the context of current measures being deployed, assessing practical and ethical aspects. For example, false negatives in people with few antibodies leading to immune individuals being incorrectly labelled as not immune or not having access to testing to demonstrate immunity. Additionally, the case of healthcare workers will be examined considering feasibility of testing, but also in terms of discrimination and stigma. Another aspect to be explored in detail is monitoring and how it erodes privacy, with the main aim of immunity passport controlling movement. Documentation systems are already presenting a serious risk to privacy, with China announcing the QR-code tracking systems is likely to stay in place after the pandemic ends. Access issues to testing can contribute to further discrimination, whereas labelling people on their basis of their COVID19 status would create a new measure of dividing the society to 'immunoprivileged and immonodeprived' people. A labelling particularly disconcerting in the absence of a free, universally available vaccine. Furthermore, Social and financial inequities would be amplified, whereas divisions between nations could be fueled. Already people with HIV are subjected to restrictions on entering, living and working in certain countries with laws that impinge on the rights of those from sexual and gender minorities. Governments should instead invest on pandemic damage limitation - test, trace and isolate, and apps that empower individuals to make safe choices about their own movements should be prioritized. Also, the development, production and global distribution of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-is key. Universal, timely, free access to a vaccination becomes possible could allow for ethical recording of vaccination status in the context of certain activities.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 1785 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6744 hospitalized for non-COVID-19 causes at 7 geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 6 to July 31, 2020, were included. METHODS: Across admission month, patient vital signs and pharmacological treatment in relationship to risk for in-hospital death were analyzed using the Poisson regression model. Incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of death are presented. RESULTS: In patients with COVID-19, the IR of mortality were 27%, 17%, 10%, 8%, and 2% from March to July, respectively, after standardization for demographics and vital signs. Compared with patients admitted in March, the risk of in-hospital death decreased by 29% [IRR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.99] in April, 61% (0.39, 0.26-0.58) in May, 68% (0.32, 0.19-0.55) in June, and 86% (0.14, 0.03-0.58) in July. The proportion of patients admitted for geriatric care with oxygen saturation <90% decreased from 13% to 1%, which partly explains the improvement of COVID-19 patient survival. In non-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, mortality rates remained relatively stable (IR 1.3%-2.3%). Compared with non-COVID-19 geriatric patients, the IRR of death declined from 11 times higher (IRR 11.7, 95% CI 6.11-22.3) to 1.6 times (2.61, 0.50-13.7) between March and July in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality risk in geriatric patients from the Stockholm region declined over time throughout the first pandemic wave of COVID-19. The improved survival rate over time was only partly related to improvement in saturation status at the admission of the patients hospitalized later throughout the pandemic. Lower incidence during the later months could have led to less severe hospitalized cases driving down mortality.","output":"Decreased Mortality Over Time During the First Wave in Patients With COVID-19 in Geriatric Care: Data From the Stockholm GeroCovid Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we describe three patients affected by metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) experiencing infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) and reduction of disease burden during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) course.

Recently, a practice-based instrument addressing biopsychosocial aspects of functioning, the Social Medical Work Capacity instrument (SMWC), was developed. Our aim was to examine the content validity of the SMWC using ICF core sets. METHODS First, we conducted a systematic search to identify relevant ICF core sets for the working age population. Second the content of these core sets were mapped to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of the SMWC. Next, we compared the content of the SMWC with the ICF-core sets. RESULTS Two work-related core sets and 31 disease-specific core sets were identified. The SMWC and the two work-related core sets overlap on 47 categories. Compared to the work-related core sets, the Body Functions and Activities and Participation are well represented in the new instrument, while the component Environmental factors is under-represented. Compared to the disease-specific core sets, items related to the social and domestic environmental factors are under-represented, while the SMWC included work-related factors complementary to the ICF. CONCLUSION The SMWC content seems relevant, but could be more comprehensive for the purpose of individual work capacity assessments. To improve assessing relevant biopsychosocial aspects, it is recommended to extend the instrument by adding personal and environmental (work- and social-related) factors as well as a more tailored use of the SMWC for assessing work capacity of persons with specific diseases or underlying illness.","output":"Content Validation of a Practice-Based Work Capacity Assessment Instrument Using ICF Core Sets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Deficient interferon responses have been proposed as one of the relevant mechanisms prompting severe manifestations of COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the interferon (IFN)- levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients in relation to severity, evolution of the clinical manifestations and immune/inflammatory profile. Methods: This is prospective study recruiting consecutive hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with SARS-COV-2 infection and matched controls. After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7  2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. Results: Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN- were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, p < 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN- levels. A significant increase in blood IFN- was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population). A similar trend was found for blood IFN- with IFN- levels below the threshold of detectability in a substantial proportion of subjects. Significantly higher values of blood lymphocytes and lower levels of IL-10 were found at each time point in patients who survived compared to patients who died. In patients who clinically improved and survived during the study, we found an inverse association between IL-10 and IFN- levels. Conclusion: The study identifies a blood immune profile defined by deficient IFN- levels associated with increased IL-10 expression in patients progressing to severe/life threatening COVID-19 conditions, suggesting the involvement of immunological pathways that could be target of pharmacological intervention.

It has been proposed that this virus originated in bats, possibly transmitted to humans by an intermediate host, making bats a group of great interest during this outbreak. Almost 10% of the world's bat species inhabit Mexico, and 14 previous novel CoVs have been recorded in Mexican bats. However, the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and the novel coronavirus are unknown. The aim of this communication was therefore to describe the phylogenetic relationships between Mexican bat-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2. We showed that Mexican bat-CoVs sequences are grouped into two genera, Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, and the new coronavirus is an independent clade within Betacoronavirus. Due to the diversity of CoVs in Mexican bats, the propensity of CoVs to shift hosts, the invasion mechanisms described for this new virus, and previous reports of animals infected by SARS-CoV-2, the risk of a possible infection from humans to Mexican bats should not be discarded and warrants further analyses. To avoid future zoonotic infectious diseases and to limit persecution of bats, we urge researchers and the general population to take extreme precautions and avoid manipulation of bats during the current and future similar outbreaks.","output":"Bats and humans during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: the case of bat-coronavirus from Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 66-year-old man who had been diagnosed with mild coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection nine days prior presented to the emergency room with acute-onset chest pain and shortness of breath.

We aimed to assess self-reported BUP-related practices and attitudes among emergency physicians. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional physician survey by adapting a validated questionnaire on opioid harm reduction practices, attitudes and barriers. We recruited physician leads from 6 Canadian provinces to administer surveys to the staff physicians in their emergency department groups between December 2018 and November 2019. We included academic and community non-locum emergency department staff physicians. We excluded responses from emergency department groups with response rates less than 50% to minimize nonresponse bias. Primary (BUP prescribing practices) and secondary (willingness and attitudes) outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: After excluding 1 group for low response (9/26 physicians), 652 of 798 (81.7%) physicians responded from 22 groups serving 34 emergency departments. Among respondents, 64.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.4%C67.8%, emergency department group range 7.1%C100.0%) had prescribed BUP at least once in their career, 38.4% had prescribed it for home initiation and 24.8% prescribed it at least once a month. Overall, 68.9% (95% CI 65.3%C72.4%, emergency department group range 24.1%C97.6%) were willing to administer BUP, 64.2% felt it was a major responsibility and 37.1% felt they understood people who use drugs. Respondents most frequently rated lack of adequate training (58.2%) and lack of time (55.2%) as very important barriers to BUP initiation. INTERPRETATION: Two-thirds of the emergency physicians surveyed prescribed BUP, although only one-quarter did so regularly and one-third prescribed it for home initiation; wide variation between emergency department groups existed. Strategies to increase BUP initiation must address physicians lack of time and training for BUP initiation and improve their understanding of people who use drugs.","output":"A cross-sectional survey on buprenorphineCnaloxone practice and attitudes in 22 Canadian emergency physician groups: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyber-physical security of financial institutions is a critical and sensitive topic.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the efficacy and safety of parathyroid allotransplantation to treat post-operative hypoparathyroidism. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Library were searched for published articles (from inception of each database to September 30, 2018). A total of 9 studies comprising 146 patients (177 allotransplantations) with post thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were identified. RESULTS: Parathyroid tissues used for allotransplant were cultured parathyroid cells, cryopreserved parathyroid cells and encapsulated microspheres. Post-transplant immunosuppression was only reported in three studies, mainly with oral prednisolone for 2 weeks to 6 months. Mean graft survival following allotransplantation was 47% (95% CI 24%-71%) when patients were followed-up to 6 months and 41% (95% CI 2.3%-80%) at 12 months. There was significant unexplained heterogeneity observed between studies in both these groups (I2 > 50%). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and serum calcium levels post intervention was not reported in all studies, but available evidence suggests the levels remains higher (PTH level around 12 pg/ml; Ca level around 8 mg/dl) post-allotransplantation for up to 24 months.

Herein, we developed two types (being indirect vs. direct) of fiber-optic biolayer interferometry (FO-BLI) biosensors for on-site CBZ monitoring. The indirect FO-BLI biosensor preincubated samples with monoclonal antibodies towards CBZ (MA-CBZ), and the mixture competes with immobilized CBZ to bind towards MA-CBZ. The direct FO-BLI biosensor used sample CBZ and CBZ-horseradish peroxidase (CBZ-HRP) conjugate to directly compete for binding with immobilized MA-CBZ, followed by a metal precipitate 3,3-diaminobenzidine to amplify the signals. Indirect FO-BLI detected CBZ within its therapeutic range and was regenerated up to 12 times with negligible baseline drift, but reported results in 25 min. However, Direct FO-BLI achieved CBZ detection in approximately 7.5 min, down to as low as 10 ng/mL, with good accuracy, specificity and negligible matric interference using a high-salt buffer. Validation of Direct FO-BLI using six paired sera and whole blood from epileptic patients showed excellent agreement with ultra-performance liquid chromatography.

We aimed to assess in this group the attack rate of asymptomatic carriers and the symptoms most frequently associated with the infection. METHODS: Occupational and clinical characteristics of HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, to March 31, 2020, were collected. For those who tested positive and for the asymptomatic positives we checked laboratory and clinical data as of May 22 to calculate the time necessary to become test-negative and to verify whether symptoms developed thereafter. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Positive tests were 139 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (122/503, 24.2%) and asymptomatic (17/1,070, 1.6%) workers (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (61/582, 10.5%), whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (5/137, 3.6%). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 76.9) and fever (OR = 9.12). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 27 days (95% CI: 24-30). CONCLUSIONS: A relevant number of HCWs can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 without displaying any symptom. Among symptomatic workers, the key symptoms to guide diagnosis are taste and smell alterations and fever.

Unfortunately, training in this competency may be perceived as tedious, time-consuming, and expendable. In preceding studies, our working group detected overconfidence effects in the self-assessment of hand hygiene competencies. Overconfidence is the belief of being better than others (overplacement) or being better than tests reveal (overestimation). The belief that members of their profession are better than other professionals is attributable to the clinical tribalism phenomenon. The study aimed to assess the correlation of overconfidence effects on hand hygiene and their association with four motivational dimensions (intrinsic, identified, external, and amotivation) to attend hand hygiene training. Methods: We conducted an open online convenience sampling survey with 103 health care professionals (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) in German, combining previously validated questionnaires for (a) overconfidence in hand hygiene and (b) learning motivation assessments. Statistics included parametric, nonparametric, and cluster analyses. Results: We detected a quadratic, u-shaped correlation between learning motivation and the assessments of ones own and others competencies. The results of the quadratic regressions with overplacement and its quadratic term as predictors indicated that the model explained 7% of the variance of amotivation (R(2) = 0.07; F(2, 100) = 3.94; p = 0.02). Similarly, the quadratic model of clinical tribalism for nurses in comparison to physicians and its quadratic term explained 18% of the variance of amotivation (R(2) = 0.18; F(2, 48) = 5.30; p = 0.01). Cluster analysis revealed three distinct groups of participants: (1) experts (n(1) = 43) with excellent knowledge and justifiable confidence in their proficiencies but still motivated for ongoing training, and (2) recruitables (n(2) = 43) who are less competent with mild overconfidence and higher motivation to attend training, and (3) unawares (n(3) = 17) being highly overconfident, incompetent (especially in assessing risks for incorrect and omitted hand hygiene), and lacking motivation for training. Discussion: We were able to show that a highly rated self-assessment, which was justified (confident) or unjustified (overconfident), does not necessarily correlate with a low motivation to learn. However, the experts learning motivation stayed high. Overconfident persons could be divided into two groups: motivated for training (recruitable) or not (unaware). These findings are consistent with prior studies on overconfidence in medical and non-medical contexts. Regarding the studys limitations (sample size and convenience sampling), our findings indicate a need for further research in the closed populations of health care providers on training motivation in hand hygiene.","output":"Correlation between Overconfidence and Learning Motivation in Postgraduate Infection Prevention and Control Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, in the UK guidance on shielding to protect vulnerable individuals included minimising face-to-face (FTF) contact and visits to hospital for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). We undertook a UK-wide survey to study how CF centres adapted their practice during this time. Method: We contacted CF nurses to explore service changes to routine outpatient care, emergency consultations, annual reviews (AR), and use of remote monitoring between March - July 2020. Results: Nineteen centres (13 adult) caring for 34% of the UK CF population replied (response rate 35%). Eleven (58%) ceased routine FTF appointments until virtual clinics were implemented, in 1 centre solely by telephone. Six centres suspended AR, the remainder integrating them into virtual or emergency FTF appointments. All noted reduction in hospital admission rates, citing better treatment compliance, reluctance to admission, effect of shielding and initiation of CFTR modulators. Twelve centres (63%) reported increased demand for psychology input. Departmental spirometry was only performed at F2Fclinics and all centres distributed remote spirometry devices to suitable pwCF, with training delivered F2F or remotely. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings continued virtually at all centres. Fourteen (73%) reported an increase in home visits for blood tests and IV antibiotic management. To cope, 20% reduced support visits and extended TIVAD flush duration intervals. Nine continued existing research activity. Most centres reported initial technical issues with virtual clinics that were subsequently addressed and have incorporated virtual appointments into their care.

Specifically, the work seeks to assess the resilience capacity demonstrated in the procurement activity by a specific company used as a case-study by identifying the indicators that enable the dimensions of organisational resilience to be detected in a longitudinal approach. Methodology: The study implemented a qualitative research approach to develop the case-study. The analysis was carried out by examining internal documents and holding a series of interviews with Amadori's Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO). Results: Resilience dimensions vary longitudinally and require different organisational responses. In brief, to respond to the different sources of risk, redundancy and rapidity were crucial during the lockdown phase, while robustness, rapidity and resourcefulness became key factors in the post-lockdown phase. Research limits: The study's results are based on a specific business case, thus limiting generalisation. Moreover, the results are preliminary as the pandemic is still ongoing. Practical implications: Findings can represent concrete help for other businesses to gain direction and adopt good practices of risk planning and management in view of resilience and business continuity.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, open-label interventional study on 256 adult patients diagnosed with mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who met the criteria for receiving bamlaninivab from November 1, 2020 to January 17, 2021. The main outcomes of return visits to the ED, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19 were compared between two groups C those who received bamlanivimab (intervention group) and those who did not receive bamlanivimab (control group). Outcomes were analyzed by using chi-square tests and through a multivariate regression model to adjust for differences in patient demographics, characteristics, and comorbidities. Results: There were 128 patients in the intervention group who received bamlanivimab and 128 patients in the control group who were discharged from the ED.

In the present study, unfavorable clinical outcomes (transfer to the intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality) were investigated in obese patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed patients with positive polymerase chain reaction test in tertiary care hospital between March-May 2020. They were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI) as normal, overweight, and obese (BMI: 18.5 - 24.99 kg/m(2), 25 - 29.99 kg/m(2), and  30 kg/m(2), respectively). We compared clinical features and laboratory findings of these groups and recorded adverse clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed for unfavorable outcomes. RESULTS: There were 99 patients (35%), 116 (41%), and 69 patients (24%) in the normal-weight, overweight, and obese group, respectively. Among all patients, 52 (18%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 30 (11%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 22 patients (8%) died. Obese patients had minimum 1 more comorbidity than normal BMI patients (73% vs. 50%, P = 0.002), and a longer median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of hospitalization (8 [5 - 12] vs. 6 [5 - 9]) days, P = 0.006). Obese participants had higher concentrations of serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin than non-obese patients (P <0.05 in all). In a multivariate analysis, obesity was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26 - 7.04, P = 0.012). Moreover, IMV requirement was associated with obesity (aOR: 8.73, 95% CI: 2.44 - 31.20, P = 0.001).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our systems and processes were strained due to high testing volumes, demand for rapid turnaround times, supply chain constraints, and constantly evolving testing algorithms and result interpretations as our knowledge of the virus and of diagnostics increased over time. In this report, we describe those challenges and subsequent adaptations made by each clinical laboratory section. We hope these details help provide potential solutions and approaches for other hospitals facing COVID-19 surges or other future pandemics.","output":"How SARS-CoV-2 Transformed the Clinical Laboratory: Challenges and Lessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper tests the hypothesis that the structure of the learning motivation of Russian and foreign medical students have undergone changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors explored the learning motives of students studying the same medical specialty at the same university. The comparative analysis of changes in the principal learning motives (professional, cognitive, developmental, creative self-actualisation, communicative, social, avoidance- and prestige-driven) from February 2019 to June 2021 was made using the assessment of students' learning motivation developed by Rean and Yakunin, as modified by Badmaeva. SPSS Statistics 22.0 was used for statistical analysis. The results confirmed the research hypothesis: the structure and manifestation of medical students' learning motives have undergone changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, most of the learning motives of Russian and foreign medical students show a high level, with primarily professional motives, which evidences a professional orientation and a conscious choice of the profession. However, such important motives as cognitive, developmental and creative self-actualisation are significantly less expressed than professional ones. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a much higher manifestation of professional motives in Russian medical students. From the authors' point of view, this can be explained by extended practice with patients while there was an increase in creative self-actualisation and a decrease in communicative and social motives. Foreign medical students show a decrease in prestige-driven motives and some decrease in social motives. The obtained results open up prospects for improving medical education and for developing the personal and professional potential of Russian and foreign medical students.","output":"A Comparative Analysis of Changes in the Learning Motivation of Russian and Foreign Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the discovery of vaccines, many deadly diseases have been contained worldwide, ultimately culminating in the eradication of smallpox and polio, which represented significant medical achievements in human health. However, this does not account for the threat influenza poses on public health. The currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines primarily confer excellent strain-specific protection. In addition to the seasonal influenza viruses, the emergence and spread of avian influenza pandemic viruses such as H5N1, H7N9, H7N7, and H9N2 to humans have highlighted the urgent need to adopt a new global preparedness for an influenza pandemic. It is vital to explore new strategies for the development of effective vaccines for pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. The new vaccine approaches should provide durable and broad protection with the capability of large-scale vaccine production within a short time. The adenoviral (Ad) vector-based vaccine platform offers a robust egg-independent production system for manufacturing large numbers of influenza vaccines inexpensively in a short timeframe. In this review, we discuss the progress in the development of Ad vector-based influenza vaccines and their potential in designing a universal influenza vaccine.","output":"Adenoviral Vector-Based Vaccine Platforms for Developing the Next Generation of Influenza Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The NHS Mental Health Implementation Plan aims to reduce length of inpatient psychiatric stays to a maximum of 32 days, yet provides little guidance on how to achieve this. Previous studies have attempted to analyse factors influencing length of stay in mental health units, focussing mostly on patient factors. These models fail to sufficiently explain the variation in duration of inpatient stay. We assess how the type of service delivered by a trust, in addition to patient factors, influences length of stay. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case cohort study in a large inner-city NHS mental health trust for all admissions in a 1 month period. Data was gathered from electronic notes of 105 patients. Descriptive univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on the data, with multiple regression analysis conducted on statistically significant data. RESULTS Short-stay assessment ward admission significantly reduced length of stay. Patients under outpatients or under care co-ordination, admitted through Mental Health Act assessment and formally detained all had longer length of stay. Out of area admissions, locum Consultant care, changing Responsible Clinician and ward transfers all led to longer length of stay. Factors indicating more severe illness such as increased observation level and polypharmacy, as well as diagnoses of psychosis or bipolar disorder were associated with longer duration of stay. Discharges requiring referral to accommodation or rehabilitation led to longer stays. The most significant factors that influenced length of stay were higher observation levels, diagnosis of psychotic illness or bipolar, and discharge to rehabilitation placement. The final model, taking into account all these factors, was able to account for 59.6% of the variability in length of stay. CONCLUSIONS The study backs up existing literature which shows patient-factors have an influence on length of stay. The study also demonstrates that service-level factors have an impact on the duration of stay. This data may be used to inform further studies which may aid provision of inpatient and community services in the future.","output":"Patient and service-level factors affecting length of inpatient stay in an acute mental health service: a retrospective case cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes that induce neutralizing antibody responses.

Such characteristics and their breath-by-breath variability might be useful indicators of respiratory health. Objectives: To enable breath-by-breath characterization of respiratory kinematics, we developed a method to detect breaths using motion sensor signals. Methods: In 34 volunteers who underwent maximal exercise testing, we used 8 motion sensors to record upper rib, lower rib and abdominal kinematics at 3 exercise stages (rest, lactate threshold and exhaustion). We recorded volumetric air flow signals using clinical exercise laboratory equipment and synchronized them with kinematic signals. Using instantaneous phase landmarks from the analytic representation of kinematic and flow signals, we identified individual breaths and derived respiratory rate signals at 1Hz. To evaluate the fidelity of kinematics-derived respiratory rate signals, we calculated their cross-correlation with the flow-derived respiratory rate signals. To identify coupling between kinematics and flow, we calculated the Shannon entropy of the relative frequency with which kinematic phase landmarks were distributed over the phase of the flow cycle. Measurements and Main Results: We found good agreement in the kinematics-derived and flow-derived respiratory rate signals, with cross-correlation coefficients as high as 0.94. In some individuals, the kinematics and flow were significantly coupled (Shannon entropy < 2) but the relationship varied within (by exercise stage) and between individuals. The final result was that the phase landmarks from the kinematic signal were uniformly distributed over the phase of the air flow signals (Shannon entropy close to the theoretical maximum of 3.32). Conclusions: The Analysis of Respiratory Kinematics method can yield highly resolved respiratory rate signals by separating individual breaths. This method will facilitate characterization of clinically significant breathing motion patterns on a breath-by-breath basis. The relationship between respiratory kinematics and flow is much more complex than expected, varying between and within individuals.","output":"Analysis of Respiratory Kinematics: a method to characterize breaths from motion signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 spillback from humans into domestic and wild animals has been well-documented.

In comparison to the 2019 air quality, Guangzhou and Wuhan noted major differences in air quality during the outbreak. Indicators of traffic pollution, particularly NO2, were significantly lower during the outbreak in all cities. Particulate matter pollution varied, with some cities observing lower concentrations and other higher concentrations during the outbreak. There was a significant decrease in air pollution levels during the outbreak. More researchers should observe changes in air quality during peculiar or major events.

Methods: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study has been characterising the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using RT-PCR test results from self-administered throat and nose swabs from randomly-selected participants in England at ages 5 years and over, approximately monthly since May 2020. Round 17 data were collected between 5 and 20 January 2022 and provide data on the temporal, socio-demographic and geographical spread of the virus, viral loads and viral genome sequence data for positive swabs. Results: From 102,174 valid tests in round 17, weighted prevalence of swab positivity was 4.41% (95% credible interval [CrI], 4.25% to 4.56%), which is over three-fold higher than in December 2021 in England. Of 3,028 sequenced positive swabs, 2,393 lineages were determined and 2,374 (99.2%) were Omicron including 19 (0.80% of all Omicron lineages) cases of BA.2 sub-lineage and one BA.3 (0.04% of all Omicron) detected on 17 January 2022, and only 19 (0.79%) were Delta. The growth of the BA.2 Omicron sub-lineage against BA.1 and its sub-lineage BA.1.1 indicated a daily growth rate advantage of 0.14 (95% CrI, 0.03, 0.28) for BA.2, which corresponds to an additive R advantage of 0.46 (95% CrI, 0.10, 0.92). Within round 17, prevalence was decreasing overall (R=0.95, 95% CrI, 0.93, 0.97) but increasing in children aged 5 to 17 years (R=1.13, 95% CrI, 1.09, 1.18). Those 75 years and older had a swab-positivity prevalence of 2.46% (95% CI, 2.16%, 2.80%) reflecting a high level of infection among a highly vulnerable group. Among the 3,613 swab-positive individuals reporting whether or not they had had previous infection, 2,334 (64.6%) reported previous confirmed COVID-19. Of these, 64.4% reported a positive test from 1 to 30 days before their swab date. Risks of infection were increased among essential/key workers (other than healthcare or care home workers) with mutually adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.26), people living in large compared to single-person households (6+ household size OR 1.73; 95% CI, 1.44, 2.08), those living in urban vs rural areas (OR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.13, 1.35) and those living in the most vs least deprived areas (OR 1.34, 95% CI, 1.20, 1.49). Conclusions: We observed unprecedented levels of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in England in January 2022, an almost complete replacement of Delta by Omicron, and evidence for a growth advantage for BA.2 compared to BA.1. The increase in the prevalence of infection with Omicron among children (aged 5 to 17 years) during January 2022 could pose a risk to adults, despite the current trend for prevalence in adults to decline.

Bacteria used different mechanisms to counterattack to existing antibiotics namely (i) enzymatic inhibition, (ii) penicillin binding protein modification, (iii) porin mutations, (iv) efflux pumps and (v) molecular modifications of antibiotic targets. Developing new antibiotics would be time consuming to address such situation, thus one of the promising approaches is by potentiating existing antibiotics. Plants used synergism to naturally defend and protect themselves from microbes. Using the same strategy, several studies have shown that the combinations of natural products and antibiotics could effectively prolong the lifespan of existing antibiotics and minimize the impact and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Combining essential oils constituents namely uvaol, ferruginol, farnesol, carvacrol, with antibiotics have proved to be efficient efflux pump inhibitors. Plant-derived compounds such as gallic acid and tannic acid are effective potentiators of various antibiotics including novobiocin, chlorobiocin, coumermycin, fusidic acid, and rifampicin, resulting in a 4-fold increase in the potencies of these antibiotics. Several lines of research, as discussed in this review, have demonstrated the effectiveness of natural products in potentiating existing antibiotics.

Consequently, there is a significant unmet need for effective therapies with good safety profiles. Daratumumab with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (daraVCD) is a novel treatment combination with a good efficacy profile in pts with EMD based on preclinical synergistic data. Methods: EMN19 is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study which aims to enroll 40 MM pts presenting with EMD either at diagnosis or following one line of treatment but not refractory to bortezomib-based regimens, from 8 sites in Turkey, Greece and Italy. Pts with bortezomib or daratumumab hypersensitivity, who received previous autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 12 weeks before Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1, or with previous allogenic stem cell transplant were excluded. Daratumumab was initially administered intravenously at 16 mg/mL, and since July 2020 has been administered subcutaneously at a fixed dose of 1800 mg, weekly during Cycles 1-2, every 2 weeks for Cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Intravenous bortezomib 1.5 mg/m 2 and oral/intravenous cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 is administered weekly, and oral/intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg is administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23. DaraVCD will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity unless refractory disease is detected by the end of Cycle 3 (progressive disease [PD] or failure to achieve a confirmed partial response [PR] or better). The present analysis includes pts who initiated study treatment 3 months prior to the cut-off date (01 June 2021). Results: In total, 34 patients were screened, 27 patients were enrolled, 2 relapsing patients died during the screening phase due to severe COVID-19 infection, 22 pts were analyzed (59% female;median age 56 years, range 44-77);14 pts (64%) were still on treatment and 8 (36%) discontinued;due to inadequate response after 3 cycles of treatment (n=3, 38%), PD (n=4, 50%), death (n=1, 13%). Fourteen pts (64%) were newly diagnosed and 8 (36%) first relapsed. International Staging System stage at baseline was I, II and III for 8 (36%), 9 (41%) and 5 (23%) pts, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0, 1 and 2 for 14 (64%), 7 (32%), and 1 patient (5%), respectively. On average, 3.0 (range 1-20) extramedullary plasmacytomas were observed per patient;most commonly reported sites were thorax (6 pts, 27%), brain, head and lower extremities (4 pts, 18% each). Twenty (91%) pts had 1 serious or non-serious treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE);8 pts (36.4%) experienced 1 sTEAEs;COVID-19 infection (n=3, 14%) urinary tract infection (n=2, 9%), infectious myocarditis, hip arthroplasty, pneumonia, cytomegaloviral pneumonia and thrombocytopenia (n=1 each, 4.5%). Thirteen (59%) pts 1 Grade 3/4 TEAE;neutropenia observed in 8 pts (36%), followed by thrombocytopenia (n=4, 18%) and COVID-19 infection (n=3, 14%). Overall, 16 (73%) pts missed 1 dose of any of the study drugs;2 (9%) pts missed 1 dose due to COVID-19 infection (7 doses), 8 (36%) due to COVID-19 vaccination (37 doses), 2 (9%) due to other COVID-19-related issues (65 doses), 10 (46%) due to other safety events (104 doses) and 9 (41%) due to other reasons (25 doses). Overall, 20 cycle delays were observed in 13 (59%) pts, with median (range) delay of 12.0 (4-133) days. Two pts (9%) had a cycle delay due to COVID-19 infection (2 cycles), 1 (5%) due to COVID-19 vaccination (1 cycle), 5 (23%) due to adverse events (8 cycles), 2 (9%) due to ASCT (2 cycles) and 7 (32%) due to other reasons (7 cycles). Total number of missed doses (missed doses due to COVID-19-related issues) were 17 (3) for daratumumab, 53 (11) for bortezomib, 45 (9) for cyclophosphamide and 123 (86) for dexamethasone;238 doses missed in total. No fatalities occurred due to any infection. Conclusions: DaraVCD was associated with a good safety profile in this high ri k MM with EMD patient population. The COVID-19 impact on missed doses was greater for dexamethasone (>60% of missed doses) than other components (~20%), however overall, the pandemic did not significantly affect the patients' safety and data integrity of the study.

access to markets, lowering commodity prices, restricting access to farmworker labor, and shifting consumer demand Media coverage of farmer responses to these stressors were coded into three alternative pathways: (i) reactive or buffering responses, (ii) adaptive responses;and (iii) transformative responses Most news media coverage focused on the pandemic's disruptive impacts on the U S food system, related negative impacts on farmers, and short-term responses by institutional actors, including policy-makers and food supply chain industry actors Farmer responses to pandemic stressors were mentioned less frequently than farmer impacts and responses by institutional actors The most common examples of farmer responses highlighted in the media reflected farmer reactive and buffering behaviors, which were mentioned significantly more frequently than adaptive or transformative responses National newspapers were more likely to cover farmer responses and present examples of adaptive and transformative strategies compared to agricultural trade journals Our findings suggest that news media coverage in the early months of the pandemic largely characterized the event as a rapid onset \`natural' disaster that created severe negative impacts Media devoted more attention to short-term policy responses designed to mitigate these impacts than to farmer responses (in general) or to discussion of the deeper structural causes of and potential solutions to the vulnerabilities revealed by the pandemic In this way, both national newspaper and agricultural trade journal coverage seems to promote frames that reduce the likelihood of the pandemic becoming the seed of a more resilient system","output":"Media coverage of a pandemic's impacts on farmers and implications for agricultural

sexually transmitted infections are lagging behind European recommendations on integration across diseases. Building on previous experiences and evidence, the INTEGRATE Joint Action arranged four national stakeholder meetings. The aim was to foster cross-disciplinary and cross-disease collaborations at national level as a vehicle for strengthened integration of testing and care services. This article presents the methodology and discusses main outcomes and recommendations of these meetings. METHODS: Local partners in Croatia, Italy, Lithuania and Poland oversaw the planning, agenda development and identification of key persons to invite to ensure that meetings addressed main challenges and issues of the respective countries. Invited national stakeholders represented policy and public health institutions, clinical settings, testing sites and community organisations. National experts and experts from other European countries were invited as speakers and facilitators. Main topic discussed was how to increase integration across HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections in testing and care policies and practice; tuberculosis was also addressed in Lithuania and Italy. RESULTS: The agendas reflected national contexts and the meetings provided a forum to engage stakeholders knowledgeable of the national prevention, testing and care systems in interaction with international experts who shared experiences of the steps needed to achieve integration in policies and practice. The evaluations showed that participants found meetings relevant, important and beneficial for furthering integration. Of the respondents 78% agreed or strongly agreed that there was a good representation of relevant national stakeholders, and 78% that decision/action points were made on how to move the agenda forward. The importance of securing participation from high level national policy makers was highlighted. Outcomes were nationally tailored recommendations on integrated policies and strategies, diversification of testing strategies, stigma and discrimination, key populations, cost effectiveness, surveillance and funding. CONCLUSIONS: Shifting from single to multi-disease approaches require collaboration among a broad range of actors and national multi-stakeholder meetings have proven excellent to kick-start this. Face-to-face meetings of key stakeholders represent a unique opportunity to share cross-sectoral perspectives and experiences, identify gaps in national policies and practices and agree on required next steps.

Electrode activation leads to the functionalization of the graphite surface with epoxy, OH, C=O, and COOH oxygenic groups and changes the carbon surface morphology and electronic structure; thus, improving the electrode's electroactivity relative to the untreated graphite. In this study, we conduct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate functionalization's role towards the positive half-cell reaction of the vanadium redox flow battery. The DFT calculations show that oxygenic groups improve the graphite felt's affinity towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple in the following order: C=O > COOH > OH > basal plane. Projected density of states (PDOS) calculations show that these groups increase the electrode's sp3 hybridization in the same order. We conclude that the increase in the sp3 hybridization is responsible for the improved electroactivity, while the oxygenic groups' presence is responsible for this sp3 increment. These insights can help in the better selection of activation processes and optimization of their parameters.","output":"The role of oxygenic groups and sp3 carbon hybridization in activated graphite electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to serve as a delivery vehicle for various interesting biomolecules makes lactic acid bacteria (LAB) very useful in several applications.

The first and the foremost step forward in this direction is the health recovery of the people infected. Our empirical study addresses this neglected point in the recent research on COVID-19 and specifically aims at exploring the impact of the environment on health recovery from COVID-19. The sample data are taken during the lockdown period in Wuhan, i.e., from 23rd January 2020 to 8th April 2020. The recently developed econometric technique of Quantile-on-Quantile regression, proposed by Shin and Zhu (2016) is employed to capture the asymmetric association between environmental factors (TEMP, HUM, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) and the number of recovered patients from COVID-19. We observe significant heterogeneity in the association among variables across various quantiles. The findings suggest that TEMP, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, NO(2,) and O(3) are negatively related to the COVID-19 recovery, while HUM and SO(2) show a positive association at most quantiles. The study recommends that maintaining a safe and comfortable environment for the patients may increase the chances of recovery from COVID-19.

Although this top-down approach is certainly efficient at forcing this new and desirable type of collaboration, our past experience demonstrated that it often results in an ambiguous relationship as not yet well integrated into the cultures of either patients or the researchers. The question our group raised from this observation was: How to generate a cultural shift toward a fruitful and long-lasting collaboration between patients and researchers? A bottom-up approach was key to our stakeholders. The overall objective was to build a trusting and bidirectional-ecosystem between patients and researchers. The specific objectives were to document: 1) the steps that led to the development of the first patient-partner strategic committee within a research center in the Province of Qubec; 2) the committees achievements after 3 years. METHODS: Eighteen volunteer members, 12 patient-partners and 6 clinician/institutional representatives, were invited to represent the six research themes of the Centre de recherche du CHU de Sherbrooke (CRCHUS) (Quebec, Canada). Information on the services offered by Committee was disseminated internally and to external partners. Committee members satisfaction was evaluated. RESULTS: From May 2017 to April 2020, members attended 29 scheduled and 6 ad hoc meetings and contributed to activities requiring over 1000 h of volunteer time in 2018C2019 and 1907 h in the 2019C2020 period. The Committees implication spanned governance, expertise, and knowledge transfer in research. Participation in these activities increased annually at local, provincial, national and international levels. The Patient-Partner Committee collaborated with various local (n = 7), provincial (n = 6) and national (n = 4) partners. Member satisfaction with the Committees mandate and format was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The CRCHUS co-constructed a Patient-Partner Strategic Committee which resulted in meaningful bilateral, trusting and fruitful collaborations between patients, researchers and partners. The bottom-up approach - envisioned and implemented by the Committee, where the expertise and the needs of patients complemented those of researchers, foundations, networks and decision-makers - is key to the success of a cultural shift.

It has crown-like spikes present on the surface, which encloses the RNA, genetic material of this deadly virus. The virus attacks pneumocytes after binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the cell surface, which ultimately leads to chemotaxis followed by leukocyte infiltration, increased permeability of blood vessels and alveolar walls, and decreased surfactant in the lung leading to various symptoms. Skin provides a window to the internal changes of the body and also to mechanisms that are not readily visible. Commonly observed skin manifestations include vesicular lesions, maculopapular exanthema, urticarial eruptions, livedo or necrosis, and other forms of vasculitis, chilblain-like lesions. The skin lesions are attributed to either the virus directly affecting the skin or interferon dysregulation due to viral RNA or vascular involvement associated with alteration in coagulation or drug-induced skin manifestations. Observation of skin involvement and the vasculature due to SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the need for a precise stratification and differential diagnostic valuation so that the mechanisms of this novel virus are clearer for better management of the condition in the future. Vascular skin lesions are not seen in all the patients of COVID, but certain lesions should definitely alarm us to evaluate for coagulation abnormalities, complement levels, and skin biopsy, especially in critically ill patients.

We present the results of circulating lymphocyte profiling and their correlation with antibody response in cancer patients tested serologically six months after receiving a two-dose schedule of mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine. METHODS: Absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets were determined using peripheral blood immunophenotyping. We collected samples for flow cytometry analysis alongside quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S1). An IgG titer  50 AU/mL defined a positive seroconversion response. RESULTS: 311 patients were evaluable for lymphocyte profiling and serologic testing. A preliminary multivariate analysis revealed that cytotoxic chemotherapy was the most consistent factor associated with lower counts of all lymphocyte subpopulations. T helper and B cells were found to be useful in predicting the occurrence of a positive seroconversion response using ROC curve analysis. A significant positive linear correlation was shown when anti-RBD-S1 IgG titers were compared to these lymphocyte subset counts. Univariate analysis indicated that antibody titers and seroconversion rates were significantly improved in the high-level T and B cell subgroups. Multivariate analysis confirmed these significant interactions, as well as the negative predictive value of immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

In this article, we report the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced for ambulance services across the UK when managing frequent callers, and reflect on how existing systems and practices are adapting to support changing patient needs. METHODS: Data reported in this article comprise reflections from the frequent caller leads in each ambulance service in the UK. All data were provided between 23 April 2020 and 1 May 2020, shortly after the peak of the outbreak in the UK. A single anonymised case study is also reported to illustrate how the pandemic is affecting peoples circumstances and contributing to frequent caller behaviour. RESULTS: Ambulance services are observing changes to the frequent caller population, with many new frequent callers due to health anxiety caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. Management of frequent callers is also changing, with multidisciplinary and multi-agency working becoming more challenging due to decreased access to external services, whether in social care or the community and voluntary sector, and the redeployment of ambulance service staff. There is also decreased face-to-face contact with frequent callers, meaning that opportunities to deliver person-centred care are reduced. However, the introduction or increased use of tele/video conferencing with other organisations has mitigated some of these challenges, and in some cases has improved engagement among external organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Health anxieties, lack of access to other health, social and community and voluntary sector services and exacerbations of social isolation and/or loneliness have reportedly contributed to changing behaviour among frequent callers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected how ambulance services have been able to manage frequent callers. Ambulance services should continue to engage with external organisations to aid the delivery of person-centred care, particularly organisations with experience in multiple complex needs such as mental health, social isolation and/or loneliness.

COVID-19 manifestations may range from mild symptoms to severe life threatening ones. The hallmark of the disease severity is related to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines manifested as a cytokine storm. Based on its anti-inflammatory activity through interfering with several pro and anti-inflammatory pathways, colchicine had been proposed to reduce the cytokine storm and subsequently improve clinical outcomes. Molecular docking analysis of colchicine against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and protease enzymes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed that colchicine provided a grid-based molecular docking method, C-DOCKER interaction energy 64.26 and 47.53 (Kcal/mol) with protease and RdRp, respectively. This finding indicated higher binding stability for colchicineCprotease complexes than the colchicineCRdRp complex with the involvement of seven hydrogen bonds, six hydrogen acceptors with Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, and Glu166 and one hydrogen-bond donors with Cys145 of the protease enzyme. This is in addition to three hydrophobic interactions with His172, Glu166, and Arg188. A good alignment with the reference compound, Boceprevir, indicated high probability of binding to the protease enzyme of SARS-CoV-2.

The WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic in March 2020. As of June 2020 it has been 7 months since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected more than 24 million people in 215 countries/territories, has caused more than 0.8 million deaths and spread unpredictably quickly among people worldwide. The infection rate in many nations continues to spike. After restraint of the initial outbreak failed, authorities turned to implementing new policies designed to slow the contagion of the virus and the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. This paper presents a systematic analysis to examine in the 25 most affected countries the association between the dates of first death and the first case of the virus to analyse the virulence and also to examine the association between the first case and the virus spread. Methodology: Data from the WHO website were used. After filtering the data, we calculated the number of days between the first reported case in China and the first reported case in each of the countries, NDFC. Another variable, NDFD, the number of days between the first reported case and first reported case of each country, was also calculated. Then we established the correlation between NDFC and NDFD. Tables are used to show the statistics and charts in order to make the findings clearer. Results: The date of the first death of each country is not dependant on the first case. When NDFC is high, the variable NDFD is homogeneously low. When the variable NDFC is low, the variable NDFD is heterogeneous. The virus could have been mutating and became more virulent during March. The countries with the highest number of deaths are not the most affected countries when analysing the death ratio of cases and population. Conclusions: COVID-19 has spread unpredictably quickly among people worldwide. In this critical situation, this paper presents a systematic analysis about the infected cases of COVID-19, deaths and association between first case and first death in each country. In order to obtain a true picture it is necessary to analyse the raw date in different dimensions, and at the end of the paper we will show a clear picture about which countries have controlled the virus very efficiently and which countries have been most affected by it to date.","output":"A Study of the Correlation between the Dates of the First Covid Case and the First Covid Death of 25 Selected Countries to Know the Virulence of the Covid-19 in Different Tropical Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches to the detection, differentiation and characterization of avian pathogens continue to be developed and refined. The PCRs, or reverse transcriptase-PCRs, may be general, designed to detect all or most variants of a pathogen, or to be serotype, genotype or pathotype specific. Progress is being made with respect to making nucleic acid approaches more suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories. Robotic workstations are now available for extraction of nucleic acid from many samples in a short time, for routine diagnosis. Following general PCR, the DNA products are commonly analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping (restriction fragment length polymorphism), using a small number of restriction endonucleases, based on a large body of sequence data. Increasingly, however, nucleotide sequencing is being used to analyze the DNA product, in part due to the expanding use of non-radioactive sequencing methods that are safe and enable high throughout.

For the CC, as for any multiparental population (MPP), effective experimental design and analysis benefit from detailed knowledge of the genetic differences between strains. Such differences can be directly determined by sequencing, but until now whole-genome sequencing was not publicly available for individual CC strains. An alternative and complementary approach is to infer genetic differences by combining two pieces of information: probabilistic estimates of the CC haplotype mosaic from a custom genotyping array, and probabilistic variant calls from sequencing of the CC founders. The computation for this inference, especially when performed genome-wide, can be intricate and time-consuming, requiring the researcher to generate nontrivial and potentially error-prone scripts. To provide standardized, easy-to-access CC sequence information, we have developed the Inbred Strain Variant Database (ISVdb). The ISVdb provides, for all the exonic variants from the Sanger Institute mouse sequencing dataset, direct sequence information for CC founders and, critically, the imputed sequence information for CC strains. Notably, the ISVdb also: (1) provides predicted variant consequence metadata; (2) allows rapid simulation of F1 populations; and (3) preserves imputation uncertainty, which will allow imputed data to be refined in the future as additional sequencing and genotyping data are collected. The ISVdb information is housed in an SQL database and is easily accessible through a custom online interface (http://isvdb.unc.edu), reducing the analytic burden on any researcher using the CC.","output":"Inbred Strain Variant Database (ISVdb): A Repository for Probabilistically Informed Sequence Differences Among the Collaborative Cross Strains and Their Founders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-cigarette-associated lung injury (EVALI) is related to the usage of e-cigarettes or a related product (e.g., vaping or dabbing).

We examined the relationship of COVID-19-related worries with sleep disturbances in patients three months after COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 illness completed a survey three months post-discharge (n=153). We measured COVID-19-related worry along two domains: worry directly related to the disease (COVID-illness worry) and worry related to the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic (COVID-impact worry). COVID-illness worry included worry regarding: 1) getting COVID again, 2) dying from COVID, 3) family members getting COVID, 4) losing a loved one to COVID, 5) unknowingly infecting others with COVID, 6) having significant financial burdens because of COVID. COVID-impact included worry regarding: 1) employment loss, 2) not having enough food, 3) not having access to medical care/medications, 4) not having access to mental health care/medications, 5) reduction in interactions with other people, 6) separation from family members, 7) being lonely. Patients rated how much they worried about each item on a 4-point scale (not at all, a little, moderately, extremely). Scores on each domain were summed to reflect overall severity. Past month sleep was assessed for insomnia symptoms (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) and self-reported sleep duration. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of COVID-illness worry and COVID-impact worry, separately, with sleep measures, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and presence of persistent COVID-related symptoms. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia (moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms) and short sleep duration (<6 h/day) was 47.0% and 39.2%, respectively. COVID-illness worry severity was significantly associated with presence of insomnia (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.13-3.23, p=0.016) and short sleep (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.25-3.86, p=0.006). In a separate model, COVID-impact worry severity was significantly associated with presence of insomnia (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.23-3.19, p=0.005) and short sleep (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.26-3.55, p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common among patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 illness, and COVID-19 related worries are associated with insomnia and short sleep. Additional research is needed to determine whether addressing COVID-19 related worries reduces sleep disturbance, which in turn may promote post-COVID recovery.

Co-morbidities have been linked with severity of disease and outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. As the pandemic progresses, patients deemed Long Haulers are being recognized as more individuals recover. Currently, there is limited data on the late sequalae of the disease especially in the population of patients with no comorbidities. Objective: Evaluate the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 infection in healthy individuals. Methods: We identified 101 patients who presented to the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) COVID-19 recovery clinic between July, 16, 2020 to October,8, 2020, and excluded all subjects with underlying comorbidities. Demographics and data regarding hospitalization history, persistent symptoms, patient health questionnaire score (PHQ-9), Generalized anxiety disorder score (GAD-7) and six-minute walk distance were collected. Results (Table 1): A total of 25 patients (24.7%) with no comorbidities were identified during the study period. Patients were predominantly female (80%), and older than 40 years (90%). More than half of subjects identified as white (52%), and 10 patients (40%) were hospitalized for COVID related symptoms. The mean duration from positive test to clinic visit was 66 days. Persistent fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and cough were reported by 96%, 84% and 68% of patients, respectively. Depression (PHQ-9  5) and anxiety (GAD-7  5) were present in 15 patients (60%), while 84% reported persistent gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and 76% reported persistent headache.

Data on demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and hospital course were obtained. Patients were divided into two groups: African Americans and non-African Americans. We examined differences in patient characteristics between groups using chi-square tests for categorical variables, t-test for parametric continuous variables, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for non-parametric continuous variables. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: : Among 710 patients, median age was 63 years, 43.8% were males, and 83.3% were African Americans. African Americans had higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension, were more likely to present with fever, and present with longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation. In-hospital mortality was similar between the groups, as was need for mechanical ventilation, ICU care, and new dialysis. African Americans were more likely to be discharged home compared to non-African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: : There was no difference in in-hospital mortality; however, African Americans had disproportionately higher hospitalizations, likely to significantly increase the morbidity burden in this population.

Many cases are selflimited, but failure to diagnose a pathology that requires clinical intervention can carry severe repercussions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carries a high cost to the patient and health care system, and may even require procedural sedation in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system based on pediatric patient factors to help determine when an MRI will change clinical management. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive pediatric patients who presented to clinic with a chief complaint of back pain between 2010 and 2018 at single orthopaedic surgery practice. Comprehensive demographic and presentation variables were collected. A predictive model of factors that influence whether MRI results in a change in management was then generated using cross-validation least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 729 patients were included, with a mean age of 15.1 years (range: 3 to 20 y). Of these, 344 (47.2%) had an MRI. A predictive model was generated, with nocturnal symptoms (5 points), neurological deficit (10 points), age (0.7 points per year), lumbar pain (2 points), sudden onset of pain (3.25 points), and leg pain (3.75 points) identified as significant predictors. A combined score of greater than 9.5 points for a given patient is highly suggestive that an MRI will result in a change in clinical management (specificity: 0.93; positive predictive value: 0.92). CONCLUSIONS A predictive model was generated to help determine when ordering an MRI may result in a change in clinical management for workup of back pain in the pediatric population. The main factors included the presence of a neurological deficit, nocturnal symptoms, sudden onset, leg pain, lumbar pain, and age.

Our strategy achieves 63 percent accuracy at state-level location inference on a manually-annotated reference dataset. We then leverage the geospatial nature of our user cohort to answer policy-relevant questions about the impact of varying state-level policy approaches that balance economic versus health concerns during Covid-19. We find that state government strategies that prioritized economic reopening over curtailing the spread of the virus created a markedly different environment and outcomes for opioid users.

Botulinum toxin-A (Botox-A) is used as pharmacologic agent not only for aesthetic purposes, but also for its vasomotor actions. This study was conducted to establish whether local application of Botox-A increased survival of random pattern skin flaps in rats by changing the expression of neurotransmitters. Forty adult Sprague-Dawley rats with a caudally-based random pattern skin flap were divided into two groups: Botox-A group and saline group. Surviving flap area and cutaneous blood flow in the flap were evaluated on postoperative days 3 and 7. After injection of Botox-A, changes in vessels were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. Levels of norepinephrine, neuropeptide-Y, nitric oxide, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were analyzed quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography, Western blot, and colorimetric assay. The survived area in the Botox-A group was significantly higher than that in the control group on postoperative days 3 and 7. Blood flow in the Botox-A group was significantly high in the proximal and middle areas immediately after the operation. The number of CD31-positive vessels in the Botox-A group was significant greater than that in the control group. Norepinephrine level in the Botox-A group decreased significantly immediately after flap elevation and at postoperative day 3. There were no significant differences in neuropeptide-Y level between the two groups.

METHODS In this study, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using standardized mortality ratios to elucidate the benefits associated with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with burn and/or inhalation injuries. A literature search was performed, and clinical outcomes in the selected studies were compared. RESULTS The meta-analysis found that the observed mortality was significantly higher than the predicted mortality in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (standardized mortality ratio, 2.07; 95 percent CI, 1.04 to 4.14). However, the subgroup of burn patients with inhalation injuries had lower mortality rates compared to their predicted mortality rates (standardized mortality ratio, 0.95; 95 percent CI, 0.52 to 1.73). Other subgroup analyses reported no benefits from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; however, these results were not statistically significant. Interestingly, the pooled standardized mortality ratio values decreased as the selected patients' revised Baux scores increased (R = -0.92), indicating that the potential benefits from the treatment increased as the severity of patients with burns increased. CONCLUSIONS The authors' meta-analysis revealed that burn patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment were at a higher risk of death. However, select patients, including those with inhalation injuries and those with revised Baux scores over 90, would benefit from the treatment. The authors suggest that burn patients with inhalation injuries or with revised Baux scores exceeding 90 should be considered for the treatment and early transfer to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center.","output":"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Patients with Burns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 in Iran, the rapid response team of Pasteur Institute of Iran was the first lab starting detection and report of suspected human samples.

Dr. Brutons description of agammaglobulinemia set the stage for ultimately understanding key signaling steps emanating from the B cell receptor. BTK is a multidomain tyrosine kinase and in the decades since Dr. Brutons discovery it has become clear that genetic defects in the regulatory domains or the catalytic domain can lead to immunodeficiency. This finding underscores the intricate regulatory mechanisms within the BTK protein that maintain appropriate levels of signaling both in the resting B cell and during an immune challenge. In recent decades, BTK has become a target for clinical intervention in treating B cell malignancies. The survival reliance of B cell malignancies on B cell receptor signaling has allowed small molecules that target BTK to become essential tools in treating patients with hematological malignancies. The first-in-class Ibrutinib and more selective second-generation inhibitors all target the active site of the multidomain BTK protein. Therapeutic interventions targeting BTK have been successful but are plagued by resistance mutations that render drug treatment ineffective for some patients. This review will examine the molecular mechanisms that drive drug resistance, the long-range conformational effects of active site inhibitors on the BTK regulatory apparatus, and emerging opportunities to allosterically target the BTK kinase to improve therapeutic interventions using combination therapies.","output":"Reining in BTK: Interdomain Interactions and Their Importance in the Regulatory Control of BTK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic is shaking up health care delivery and markets.

FebriDx diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in the emergency room and urgent care setting. METHODS A prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), with and without a confirmed fever at the time of enrolment, was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx to identify clinically significant bacterial infection with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. The reference method consisted of an algorithm with physician override that included bacterial cell culture, respiratory PCR panels for viral and atypical pathogens, procalcitonin, and white blood cell count. RESULTS Among 220 patients enrolled, 100% reported fever 100.5F within the last 72 hours while 55% had a measured hyperthermia (T > 100.4) at the time of enrolment. FebriDx demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 77-100%), specificity of 94% (88-98%), PPV of 76% (59-87%), and a NPV of 99% (93-100%).

METHODS: A 43-question survey was sent to cardiac surgery Centres worldwide. The survey analysed the pre-pandemic organization of the Centre, the Centre's response to Covid-19 in terms of re-organization pathways, surveillance methods, personalprotective equipment (PPE), and allowed surgical practice with results. RESULTS: Sixty-one out of 64 Centres (95.3%) fulfilled the survey. One third of ICUs were transformed into COVID-19 dedicated-ICUs and one-third moved to another location inside the hospital. Negative-pressure rooms were available in 60.6% Centres. Informative measures from hospital administration were received after the first COVID-19 admitted case in 36.1% and during the spread of the infection inside the hospital in 19.6%. Inadequate supply of PPE was common, with no COVID-surveillance of the medical personnel in 4.9% of Centres. COVID-19 infected 7.4% of staff surgeons , 8.3% of residents and 9.5% of anaesthetists. Cardiac surgery caseload declined in 93.4% Centres. COVID-19 infection in patients receiving cardiac surgery resulted in 41-50% mortality in 9.5% Centres, and 91-100% mortality in 4.7% Centres. Successful weaning with survival from V-V ECMO and V-A ECMO was <50% in 79.2% and 80.0% Centres respectively. COVID-19 infection in transplanted patients was rare, with a reported mortality of 0.5% and 1% in one Centre each.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shift to online teaching methods in university was mandated in many countries to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This severely affected the teaching of psychomotor ability skills such as head and neck examination skills, resulting in a share of students that have only been taught such ENT-specific examination skills with online courses; our study aimed to measure performance and capacity of self-evaluation in these students. After completing a new extensive online Ear Nose Throat (ENT) examination course, we conducted a standardized clinical skills exam for nine different ENT examination items with 31 students. Using Likert scales, self-evaluation was based on questionnaires right before the clinical skills exam and objective evaluation during the exam was assessed following a standardized regime. Self-evaluation and objective evaluation were correlated. To compare the exclusive online teaching to traditional hands-on training, a historic cohort with 91 students was used. Objective examination performance after in-classroom or online teaching varied for single examination items while overall assessment remained comparable. Overall, self-evaluation did not differ significantly after online-only and in-classroom ENT skill teaching. Nevertheless, misjudgment of ones skill level increased after online-only training compared to in-classroom teaching. Highest levels of overestimation were observed after online training in simple tasks. While gender and interest in ENT did not influence self-evaluation and misjudgment, higher age of participants was associated with an overestimation of skills. Medical students with online-only training during the COVID-19 pandemic achieved similar ENT examination skills to those with traditional on-campus training before the pandemic. Nevertheless, students with online-only training were more prone to misjudge their skills when they assessed their skills. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, current medical students and graduates might therefore lack individual specific psychomotor skills such as the ENT examination, underlining the importance of presence-based teaching.","output":"Misjudgment of Skills in Clinical Examination Increases in Medical Students Due to a Shift to Exclusively Online Studies during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic, which calls for prompt action in identifying suspected cases at an early stage through risk prediction.

Methods: The study population included 608,994 adults aged 60 years who underwent health examinations between 2009 and 2010. Data were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. NAFLD was assessed using the fatty liver index (FLI). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the association between NAFLD and dementia. Results: During 6,495,352 person-years of follow-up, 48,538 participants (8.0%) developed incident dementia. The participants were classified into low (FLI<30), intermediate (FLI 30 and <60), and high (FLI 60) groups.

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for low rectal cancers were included in the study. Clinical, pathological and follow-up data were recorded over a 4-year period. The mean follow-up was 25 months RESULTS A total of 53 patients were included in the study, 30 of whom were males. The mean age was 64.14 years (range, 34-86 years). The mean hospital stay was 8.2 days (range, 4-42 days). Fifty were completed laparoscopically and three were converted to an open procedure. Thirty-eight were anterior resections and 15 were abdominoperineal resections. Twenty-four patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The total mesorectal excision was optimal in 51 (98%) cases. There were no anastomotic sequelae and no surgical mortality. There was no local recurrence detected.

Elusive genetic mechanisms might be operative, as a multitude of genetic factors are widely shared between the SE Asian populations, such as the more than 60 different thalassemia syndromes (principally dominated by the HbE trait). In this study, we have plotted COVID-19 infection and death rates in SE Asian (SEA) countries against heterozygote HbE and thalassemia carrier prevalence. COVID-19 infection and death incidence numbers appear inversely correlated with the prevalence of HbE and thalassemia heterozygote populations. We posit that the evolutionary protective effect of the HbE and other thalassemic variants against malaria and the dengue virus may extend its advantage to resistance to COVID-19 infection, as HbE heterozygote population prevalence appears to be positively correlated with immunity to COVID-19. Host immune system modulations induce antiviral interferon responses and alter structural protein integrity, thereby inhibiting cellular access and viral replication.

Flavonoids abundantly present in the fruits and vegetables, especially quercetin, are shown to have antiviral activities. MAIN TEXT: This paper reviews the capability of the plant flavonoid quercetin to fight the novel coronavirus and the possibility for drug development based on this. The mode of action explaining the known pathways through which this molecule succeeds in the antiviral activity, action of quercetin on SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL(pro), antiviral activities of its derivatives on human viruses, effect of combination of zinc co-factor along with quercetin in the COVID-19 treatment, and the regulation of miRNA genes involved in the viral pathogenesis are discussed. Proof for this concept is provided following the virtual screening using ten key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 and assessing their interactions. Active residues in the 3D structures have been predicted using CASTp and were docked against quercetin. Key proteins 3CL(pro), spike glycoprotein/ human ACE2-BOAT1 complex, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, main peptidase, spike glycoprotein, RNA replicase, RNA binding protein, papain-like protease, SARS papain-like protease/ deubiquitinase, and complex of main peptidase with an additional Ala at the N-terminus of each protomer, have shown the binding energies ranging between ? 6.71 and ? 3.37 kcal/ Mol, showing that quercetin is a potential drug candidate inhibiting multiple SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. CONCLUSION: The antiviral properties of flavonoid and the molecular mechanisms involved are reviewed. Further, proof for this concept is given by docking of key proteins from SARS-CoV-2 with quercetin.

Patchy virological testing has hampered interpretation of confirmed case counts, and unknown rates of asymptomatic and mild infections make it challenging to develop evidence-based public health policies. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","output":"Estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and epidemiological parameters with uncertainty from serological surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging clinical evidences highlight the association of Interleukin-8 (IL8) with endodontic pulpitis.

Recent studies suggest that PP in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure is well tolerated and improves oxygenation. However, little is known regarding patient triggered ventilation in intubated patients with ARDS undergoing PP. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience with placing patients in the prone position in 2 cohorts of subjects with moderate and severe ARDS (ie, one cohort with ARDS related to COVID-19, the other with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19), many of whom were receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single 22-bed mixed ICU. The subjects included in the analysis were  18 y old, met the Berlin definition for moderate or severe ARDS (whether related COVID-19 or not), and underwent PP during invasive ventilation. RESULTS 39 subjects were included in the analysis: 20 subjects had ARDS related to COVID-19, while 19 had ARDS related to other etiologies. A total of 113 PP episodes were analyzed: 84 during PSV and 29 during volume control continuous mandatory ventilation. PP during PSV was well tolerated and was effective in improving arterial oxygenation (ie, an increase of median PaO2 /FIO2 from 100 mm Hg [interquartile range 75-120] before PP to 135 mm Hg [interquartile range 111-161] at the end of the PP session, P < .0001). No significant difference between continuous mandatory ventilation and PSV was noted regarding arterial oxygenation during PP. Compared with continuous mandatory ventilation mode, PP during PSV was associated with a significant decrease in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (4% vs 69% of subjects, P < .001), while sedative requirements remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS In a retrospective analysis of consecutive intubated subjects with moderate or severe ARDS, related or not to COVID-19, spontaneous breathing during PP was well tolerated and achieved significant improvement in arterial oxygenation.","output":"Prone Positioning in Spontaneously Breathing Subjects With Moderate or Severe ARDS During Invasive Ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated public health responses on an unprecedented scale. Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods: We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results: In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion: On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy.

Presimulation, postsimulation, and 3-months postsimulation questionnaires measured changes in confidence, knowledge, and clinical practice. Statistical analysis was completed using related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: Twenty-four residents participated in the simulation. Questionnaire response rates were 100% presimulation and postsimulation and 88% 3-months postsimulation. Confidence scores (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely) improved with donning and doffing personal protective equipment (from 3.0 to 4.1, p < .001), ARDS management (from 3.1 to 4.0, p < .001), and COVID-19 airway management (from 2.8 to 4.0, p < .001). Correct answers on 10 knowledge questions increased significantly between presimulation and postsimulation (from 5.1 to 9.0, p < .001) but not between presimulation and 3-months postsimulation (from 5.1 to 5.8, p = .27). All participants who cared for COVID-19 patients at 3 months agreed or strongly agreed that their current management of COVID-19 patients was directly influenced by the simulation session (M = 4.4). DISCUSSION: This simulation is a safe, effective method of providing the experiential training necessary to care for actual COVID-19 patients during an active pandemic.","output":"Implementing COVID-19 Simulation Training for Anesthesiology Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2005, a new human coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was identified in Hong Kong.

However, the role of this heterogeneity in shaping the overall dynamics of disease transmission is not well understood. Objective: To investigate the role of heterogeneous transmission among different towns in Massachusetts in shaping the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, especially the recent decline during winter of 2020/2021. Design, Setting, Participants: Analysis of COVID-19 data collected and archived by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Exposures: The entire population of the state of Massachusetts is exposed to the virus responsible for COVID-19, to varying degrees. This study quantifies this variation. Main outcome measures: Weekly observations, by town, on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, during the period (April 15th, 2020 to February 9th 2021). Results: The relative decline in COVID-19 cases, during January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021, in the group of towns with higher total accumulated cases in the period before January 12th, 2021 is significantly larger than the corresponding relative decline in the group of towns with lower accumulated cases during the same period. Conclusions and Relevance: Heterogeneous nature of transmission is playing a significant role in shaping the rapid recent decline (January 12th to February 9th, 2021) in reported cases in Massachusetts, and probably around the country. These findings are relevant to how we estimate the threshold defining herd immunity, suggesting that we should account for effects due to heterogeneity.","output":"Role of Heterogeneous Transmission in the Decline of COVID-19 Cases During Winter of 2020/2021 in Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 outbreak has quickly become a worldwide pandemic emergency.

Methods: In this study, we have collected the data of Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO 2 , NO 2 and O 3 from 14 representative cities in China in the past 5 years, and calculated the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in the corresponding city. First, we explored correlation relationship between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Then, we try to point out the air pollutants that affect the level of CFR and evaluated their predictive value. Results: We have observed a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1-year, 3-year, 5-year), PM2.5 (1-year, 3-year, 5-year), and PM10 (1-year, 3-year, 5-year).

Activity restrictions imposed by the government through official regulations for various regions were one of the causes of the reduction of movement. During the pandemic, the intensity of pedestrian use seemed to be lower than before. However, a particular location showed an interesting phenomenon of intervention on the pedestrian path around public facilities, which did not change the intensity of use. Interestingly, the intervention on the pedestrian path was around the buildings that directly handled Covid-19 and had a high transmission risk, namely hospitals and markets. This paper employed a qualitative approach by collecting the data through field observation in 3 (three) designated hospitals in Surabaya city, which were considered vulnerable places and aim to understand complex phenomena. The result found that the intervention of the pedestrian path was mainly located on the critical side for movement and circulation as well as the mobilization of the service area, also indicated there are use pedestrian path to paddle, wait and relax at certain time.

This affected implementation of community alerts, early isolation, contact tracing, vaccination, and safe and dignified burials. To quickly understand community perspectives and improve community engagement, collaborators from the DRC Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explored a new method of collecting, coding, and quickly analyzing community feedback. METHODS: Over 800 DRC Red Cross local volunteers recorded unstructured, free-text questions and comments from community members during community Ebola awareness activities. Comments were coded and analyzed using a text-coding system developed by the collaborators. Coded comments were then aggregated and qualitatively grouped into major themes, and time trends were examined. RESULTS: Communities reported a lack of information about the outbreak and the response, as well as concerns about the Ebola vaccination program and health care quality. Some doubted that Ebola was real. The response used the feedback to revise some community engagement approaches. For example, 2 procedural changes that were followed by drops in negative community responses were: using transparent body bags, which allayed fears that bodies or organs were being stolen, and widening the eligibility criteria for Ebola vaccination, which addressed concerns that selectively vaccinating individuals within Ebola-affected communities was unfair. DISCUSSION: This system is unique in that unstructured feedback collected by local volunteers in the course of their work was rapidly coded, analyzed, and given to health authorities for use in making course corrections throughout the response. It provides a platform for local voices to be heard throughout an emergency response and provides a mechanism for assessing the effects of program adjustments on community sentiments.","output":"New Mixed Methods Approach for Monitoring Community Perceptions of Ebola and Response Efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commonly used in human geography, quality of life (QOL) refers to the way and degree to which objective human needs are met, not only existential ones, but also those regarding the development of the human personality.

To fully identify the regularity of spatial differences in the analysed phenomenon, 380 local units are used as reference points. First, we formulated an operational definition of multifaceted QOL with its separate dimensions, as well as selecting and constructing organized indicators that can be determined at the local level. Then we quantified local differences in the rate of growth and the level of QOL using multivariate analysis. Third, on the basis of the obtained results, we sought to reach the most significant conclusions: (1) the dynamic economic growth, enjoyed in Poland in 2004C2018, did not change significantly the spatial diversity of the quality of life on a local level. (2) To a large extent, the persistent differences in the quality of life in Poland are related to the historical spatial differences in the level of urbanisation and the well-established, traditional economic structure of the specific territorial units.

With a multicenter study in 361 hospitals from 52 countries, we sought to study the mortality and pulmonary complications of COVID-19 patients undergoing EGS. METHODS: All patients aged 17 years and diagnosed preoperatively with COVID-19 between February and July 2020 were included. EGS was defined as the urgent/emergent performance of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or laparotomy. The main outcomes were 30-day mortality and 30-day pulmonary complications (a composite of acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected mechanical ventilation, pneumonia). Planned subgroup analyses were performed based on presence of preoperative COVID-related respiratory findings (e.g. cough, dyspnea, need for oxygen therapy, chest radiology abnormality). RESULTS: A total of 1,045 patients were included, of which 40.1% were female and 50.0% were older than 50 years; 461 (44.1%), 145 (13.9%), and 439 (42.0%) underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparotomy, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 15.1% (158/1,045) and the overall pulmonary complication rate was 32.9% (344/1,045); in the subgroup of laparotomy patients, the rates were 30.6% (134/438) and 59.2% (260/439), respectively.

We report a systematic review and meta analysis based on all published high quality data up to and including June 3rd 2021 on the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women infected with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data Sources PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science databases were queried from inception up to June 3rd 2021. Study Eligibility Criteria We included all clinical studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and rapid communications) that reported data on any maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Data were analyzed as pooled proportions or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in meta-analysis models. Results We included 111 studies enrolling 42754 COVID-19-positive pregnant women. From COVID-19-positive pregnant women, the incidence rate of cesarean section was 53.2% (95% CI: 48%C58.4%), 41.5% (95% CI: 36.3%C46.8%) for spontaneous vaginal delivery and 6.4% (95% CI: 4.5%C9.2%) for operative delivery. The rate of some adverse neonatal events was relatively high in mothers infected with COVID-19 including premature delivery (16.7%, 95% CI: 12.8%C21.5%), and low birthweight (16.7%, 95% CI: 12.8%C21.5%). Vertical transmission (3.5%, 95% CI: 2.7%C4.7%), neonatal death (3%, 95% CI: 2%C4%), stillbirth (1.9%, 95% CI: 1.5C2.4%) and maternal mortality (0.012% 95% CI: 0.010-0.014%) were rare adverse events. Mean birth weight was 3069.7g, 95% CI: 3009.7gC3129.8g). In the comparative analysis, COVID-19 significantly increased the risk of premature delivery (OR= 1. 48, [95% CI; 1 .22, 1.8]), preeclampsia (OR= 1. 6, [95% CI; 1.2, 2.1]), stillbirth (OR= 2.36, [95% CI 1.24, 4.462]), neonatal mortality (OR= 3.35, [95% CI; 1.07, 10.5]), and maternal mortality (OR= 3.08, [95% CI; 1.5, 6.3]). Pooled analyses were homogenous, with mild heterogeneity in premature delivery and preeclampsia outcomes. Conclusion Data must be interpreted with caution as limited data is available and no complete assessment of bias is possible at this time. Our data suggests that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 seem to be at higher risk for lower birth weights and premature delivery. There is no evidence at this time of the sharply increased maternal mortality that was seen with both the previous 2002 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemics.","output":"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of COVID Maternal and Neonatal Clinical Features and Pregnancy Outcomes to June 3rd 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with hyperinflammation induced by excessive release of a range of cytokines and chemokines. Among a plethora of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a pivotal role in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as IL-6 has been proposed to initiate hypersecretion of cytokines by activating the Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Hence, targeting IL-6 and its receptor can be an appropriate therapeutic strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, tocilizumab (TCZ) is a well-known monoclonal antibody for its anti-inflammatory activities. TCZ has been designed to bind two different IL-6 receptors, viz., membrane-bound and soluble receptors. As an antagonist of IL-6 receptors, TCZ inhibits the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of cytokines-producing genes.Hence, the inhibition of IL-6 receptors can substantially reduce hyperinflammation, a key characteristic of severely infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. TCZ has much promise in terms of treating SARS-CoV-2-related hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ damage. Hence, TCZ has been proposed as a potential therapeutic drug for treating COVID-19 disease. However, several discrepancies still exist, such as a well-defined molecular mechanism, efficacy, and safety parameters. In this context, various databases, including Medline, ResearchGate, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were explored employing keywords such as Cytokine storm, COVID-19, hyper inflammation, IL-6, TCZ, and SARS-COV-2 up to May 2021. The authors independently collected and evaluated research papers for inclusion in the current review, relying on their relatedness to the main theme of the literature review. So, this narrative review aims to provide updated information about the molecular mechanism, efficacy, and safety of TCZ in the treatment of COVID-19.

This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on dental practice and dentists feelings in Latin America. Methods: A survey was conducted with dentists from 11 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries in SeptemberCDecember 2020. Professionals were invited by email and via an open campaign promoted on social media. The questions investigated dental care routines, practice changes, and feelings about the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables. Proportions were compared using chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 2127 responses were collected from a sample with diverse demographic, sex, work, and education characteristics. The impact of COVID-19 was considered high/very high by 60% of respondents. The volume of patients assisted weekly was lower compared with the pre-pandemic period (mean reduction = 14  15 patients). A high rate of fear to contracting the COVID-19 at work was observed (85%); 4.9% of participants had a positive COVID-19 test. The main professional challenges faced by respondents were reduction in the number of patients or financial gain (35%), fear of contracting COVID-19 (34%), and burden with or difficulty in purchasing new personal protective equipment (22%). The fear to contracting COVID-19 was influenced by the number of weekly appointments. A positive test by the dentists was associated with their reports of having assisted COVID-19 patients. The most cited feelings about the pandemic were uncertainty, fear, worry, anxiety, and stress. Negative feelings were more prevalent for professionals who did not receive training for COVID-19 preventive measures and those reporting higher levels of fear to contract the disease.

Through overland runoff and tile drainage, zoonotic pathogens can contaminate surface water and streambed sediment and could affect both wildlife and human health. This study examined the environmental occurrence of gene markers for livestock-related bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens and antibiotic resistance in surface waters within the South Fork Iowa River basin before and after periods of swine manure application on agricultural land. Increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding Iowa's state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health. Additionally, the occurrence of HEV and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment. During this study, several zoonotic pathogens were detected including Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, pathogenic enterococci, and S. aureus; all of which can pose mild to serious health risks to swine, humans, and other wildlife. This research provides the foundational understanding required for future assessment of the risk to environmental health from livestock-related zoonotic pathogen exposures in this region.

Our main empirical findings are as follows. First, we find that the deterioration of the COVID-19 pandemic raised the risk of stock, bond, crude oil, and foreign exchange markets sequentially in the short term. Second, from the perspective of the medium and long term, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered substantial risk spillovers across financial markets, which is also highly correlated with the degree of investor panic. Finally, we show that different markets played different roles in terms of risk transmission during the pandemic. Specifically, the stock and crude oil markets acted more as risk senders, the gold and foreign exchange markets acted more as risk receivers, and the bond market served as a transfer station of risk.

METHODS: 144 individuals participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to three mask groups of 48 (N95, SURGICAL, and NO MASK) with two exercise subgroups for each mask group (MAX, n = 24; SUB, n = 24) for both sexes. Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05). No differences were noted for hemodynamic and hematologic function with N95 and SURGICAL compared to NOMASK for either intensity (P > 0.05). Females showed significantly greater HR values at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to NO MASK, but no significant differences were noted for hematological function between sexes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that wearing a face mask (N95/surgical) while exercising has no detrimental effects on hemodynamic/hematologic function in both males and females, and suggest that wearing a mask, particularly a surgical mask, while exercising during the ongoing pandemic is safe and poses no risk to individual's health.

Impairment in endothelial function may contribute to the acute but also to possible long-term consequences in patients with PIMSTS. The aim of this pilot study is to assess non-invasively the endothelial (dys)function using reactive hyperemic peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) 6 months after the acute inflammatory phase. Methods: Ten patients with previous diagnosis of PIMS-TS were compared to age-matched controls. The endothelial function was assessed using the EndoPAT device which provides the reactive hyperemic index (RHI) of endothelial function in a 15-min test. Cardiac function indices by means of LV fractional shortening (FS) was also assessed. Results: There were no significant differences regarding age (11.2  3.0 vs 13.6  2.4, p = 0.063), height, weight and body surface area, (BSA: 1.49  0.36 vs 1.52  0.25, p = 0.856) in patients with previous diagnosis of PIMS-TS and controls respectively.

There is evidence that private sector TB treatment has substandard treatment follow-up, which could be improved using VOT. However, acceptability of VOT in the private sector has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey employing a theoretical framework for healthcare intervention acceptability to measure private provider perceptions of VOT across seven constructs in three cities of Viet Nam: Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hai Phong. We investigated the differences in private providers attitudes and perceptions of VOT using mixed ordinal models to test for significant differences in responses between groups of providers stratified by their willingness to use VOT. RESULTS: A total of 79 private providers completed the survey. Sixty-two providers (75%) indicated they would use VOT if given the opportunity. Between private providers who would and would not use VOT, there were statistically significant differences (p0.001) in the providers beliefs that VOT would help identify side effects faster and in their confidence to monitor treatment and provide differentiated care with VOT. There were also significant differences in providers beliefs that VOT would save them time and money, address problems faced by their patients, benefit their practice and patients, and be relevant for all their patients. CONCLUSION: Private providers who completed the survey have positive views towards using VOT and specific subpopulations acknowledge the value of integrating VOT into their practice. Future VOT implementation in the private sector should focus on emphasizing the benefits and relevance of VOT during recruitment and provide programmatic support for implementing differentiated care with the technology.","output":"Assessing private provider perceptions and the acceptability of video observed treatment technology for tuberculosis treatment adherence in three cities across Viet Nam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Schools were closed intermittently across Hong Kong to control the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to significant physical and psychosocial problems among children and youths.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study involved children and youths aged 18 years or younger with COVID-19 in the 3 waves of outbreaks from January 23 through December 2, 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 through January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic characteristics, travel and contact histories, lengths of hospital stay, and symptoms were captured through the central electronic database. Individuals who were infected without recent international travel were defined as having domestic infections. RESULTS: Among 397 children and youths confirmed with COVID-19 infections, the mean (SD) age was 9.95 (5.34) years, 220 individuals (55.4%) were male, and 154 individuals (38.8%) were asymptomatic. There were significantly more individuals who were infected without symptoms in the second wave (59 of 118 individuals [50.0%]) and third wave (94 of 265 individuals [35.5%]) than in the first wave (1 of 14 individuals [7.1%]) (P = .001). Significantly fewer individuals who were infected in the second and third waves, compared with the first wave, had fever (first wave: 10 individuals [71.4%]; second wave: 22 individuals [18.5%]; third wave: 98 individuals [37.0%]; P < .001) or cough (first wave: 6 individuals [42.9%]; second wave: 15 individuals [12.7%]; third wave: 52 individuals [19.6%]; P = .02). Among all individuals, 394 individuals (99.2%) had mild illness. One patient developed chilblains (ie, COVID toes), 1 patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 1 patient developed postCCOVID-19 autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In all 3 waves, 204 patients with COVID-19 (51.4%) had domestic infections. Among these individuals, 186 (91.2%) reported having a contact history with another individual with COVID-19, of which most (183 individuals [90.0%]) were family members. In the third wave, 18 individuals with domestic infections had unknown contact histories. Three schoolmates were confirmed with COVID-19 on the same day and were reported to be close contacts.

Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID-19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor's power-law) and Ma's population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell's neutral theory, and Ma's diversity-time relationship adapted for the infection-time relationship. Fisher-Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter (b > 2), being significantly higher than the b-values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID-19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold (M 0) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak-stage), space (region) and public-health interventions. Exceeding M 0, local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections.

The study objective is thus to investigate whether population-wide changes in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values over time are associated with the daily fraction of positive COVID-19 tests. In addition, this study analyses the factors that could influence RT-PCR Ct values. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 63,879 patients from May 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020, in all COVID-19 facilities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Data collected included number of tests and newly diagnosed cases, as well as Ct values, age, sex nationality, and symptomatic status. Ct values were found to be negatively and very weakly correlated with the fraction of daily positive tests in the population r = -0.06 (CI 95%: -0.06; -0.05; p=0.001). The R-squared for the regression model (adjusting for age and number of daily tests) showed an accuracy of 45.3%. Ct Values showed an association with nationality (p=0.012). After the stratification, the association between Ct values and the fraction of daily positive cases was only maintained for the female sex and Bahraini-nationality. Symptomatic presentation was significantly associated with lower Ct values (higher viral loads). Ct values do not show any correlation with age (p=0.333) or sex (p=0.522).

The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from the analysis. RESULTS: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory and radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)-based data-driven feature selection selected the 10 features with the highest F values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the 10 selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age >70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81). CONCLUSION: Both models showed good performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using 10 admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals. The models hold promise to aid decision-making during a hospital bed shortage.","output":"Predicting mortality of individual patients with COVID-19: a multicentre Dutch cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While there is extensive literature on how classroom-based assessment (CBA) can be effectively put into practice, little is known about its implementation in L2 contexts, especially in the young English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learner context. This study endeavored to investigate teachers CBA practices and factors that might exert influences on them. A purposive sample of three EFL teachers from two primary schools participated in this case study. Our thematic analysis revealed that the potential of CBA in supporting young EFL learners learning had not been fulfilled. The teachers failed to clarify such objectives and success criteria to their students. Despite the use of multiple assessments, the teachers relied heavily on formal assessments, with student-involving assessments being less frequently used. Moreover, there was a heavy reliance on norm-referenced assessment and evaluative feedback. It was also found that teachers CBA practices faced complex challenges related to teacher, student, context and system factors. Practical implications for how CBA can be effectively implemented in similar EFL contexts are discussed.","output":"Implementing Classroom-Based Assessment for Young EFL Learners in the Chinese Context: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily a respiratory pathogen and its clinical manifestations are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the most severe of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.","output":"Possible Mechanisms Responsible for Acute Coronary Events in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the causal relationship between the efficiency of countrys judicial system and the quality of bank lending, using the contracts enforcement reforms that have been implemented in four European countries as a quasi-natural experiment.

To investigate the initial introductions and transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 in the country, we performed the largest genomic epidemiology study of COVID-19 in Pakistan and generated 150 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected before June 1, 2020. We identified a total of 347 variants, 29 of which were over-represented in Pakistan. Meanwhile, we found over one thousand intra-host single-nucleotide variants. Several of them occurred concurrently, indicating possible interactions among them. Some of the hypermutable positions were not observed in the polymorphism data, suggesting strong purifying selections. The genomic epidemiology revealed five distinctive spreading clusters. The largest cluster consisted of 74 viruses which were derived from different geographic locations and formed a deep hierarchical structure, indicating an extensive and persistent nation-wide transmission of the virus that was probably contributed by a signature mutation of this cluster. Twenty-eight putative international introductions were identified, several of which were consistent with the epidemiological investigations. No progenies of any of these 150 viruses have been found outside of Pakistan, most likely due to the nonphmarcological intervention to control the virus. This study has inferred the introductions and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which could provide a guidance for an effective strategy for disease control.","output":"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE It has been asserted that burnout-a condition ascribed to unresolvable job stress-should not be mistaken for a depressive syndrome. In this confirmatory factor analytic study, the validity of this assertion was examined. METHODS Five samples of employed individuals, recruited in Switzerland and France, were mobilized for this study (N = 3,113). Burnout symptoms were assessed with the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)-General Survey, and the MBI for Educators. Depressive symptoms were measured with the PHQ-9. RESULTS In all five samples, the latent factors pertaining to burnout's components correlated on average more highly with the latent Depression factor than with each other, even with fatigue-related items removed from the PHQ-9. Second-order factor analyses indicated that the latent Depression factor and the latent factors pertaining to burnout's components were reflective of the same overarching factor.

In the event of a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving procedure. In fact, the need for CPR among hospitalized ESRD patients is almost 20 times higher than the general population. Complications of CPR include thoracic injuries such as flail chest, rib fractures, pneumothorax, and rarely intra-abdominal complications. Hemoperitoneum is a well-recognized complication among peritoneal dialysis patients but as a complication of CPR is rarely described. Inappropriate CPR technique, hepatic ischemia and venous congestion, platelet dysfunction, and the use of anti-platelet agents can increase the risk of such injury and bleeding. Hemoperitoneum in this setting can be serious with significant complications and may require transition from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis.

METHODS Participants performed three stretching sessions of different intensities: 40 % (R40) of maximal dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), 60 % (R60) of ROM, and 80 % (R80) of ROM. Each stretching lasted 10 min. The GAS architecture, GAS shear elastic modulus, ankle passive torque-angle, and muscle activity were assessed before, during, and after the stretching. RESULTS The absolute and relative (i.e., normalized to the static stretching start value) GAS shear elastic modulus relaxation varied across stretching intensities. The absolute passive torque relaxation varied across intensities (p < 0.05) but not when normalized to the stretching start value. No significant changes were observed in GAS fascicle length during the stretching (p = 0.93). After stretching, passive torque at a given angle was significantly decreased for R60 [-0.99  0.59 Nm (-6.5  3.8 %), p < 0.001] and R80 [-1.05  1.12 Nm (-6.8  6.3 %), p = 0.004], and GAS shear elastic modulus decreased only for the R80 [-9.3  7.2 kPa (-14.1 %), p = 0.003]. No significant correlations were found between the magnitude of relaxation during stretching and post-stretching effect in the GAS shear elastic modulus or ankle passive torque variables. No significant relation was found between the shear elastic modulus and the ankle passive torque responses during and after stretching.

This study compared iPACK + ACB (adductor canal block) with PAI (periarticular infiltration) + ACB and ACB alone in terms of postoperative analgesia and functional improvement. METHODS: This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 105 patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Patients received ACB, iPACK + ACB, and PAI + ACB along with spinal anesthesia. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) numeric rating scale (NRS) at 48 h. Secondary outcomes were cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption within 48 h, timed up-and-go test, range of motion, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. RESULTS: The 48-h AUC movement NRS score in the iPACK + ACB group was significantly lower than in the PAI + ACB and ACB groups (p < 0.05). At the postoperative 48th h, the opioid consumption of the iPACK + ACB group was lower than those of the ACB and PAI + ACB groups (p < 0.001). The patients in the iPACK + ACB group had significantly shorter discharge and mobilization days than the ACB and PAI + ACB groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The adding of an iPACK block to the ACB improves postoperative analgesia and reduces opioid consumption.

OBJECTIVES This article presents methodological guidelines for just-in-time qualitative research based on our current, pandemic-relevant research. METHODS The processes followed while conducting two longitudinal, online qualitative studies addressing the lived experience and response to the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Methodological challenges faced were then identified, and specific design and implementation guidelines were developed. The ways in which these guidelines can be applied to conduct just-in-time research during the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises were further delineated using examples from our pandemic-relevant research. RESULTS Six guidelines were identified: (a) capitalize on fast track review and reporting processes; (b) prioritize accessibility during sample specification and selection; (c) optimize recruitment and retention strategies; (d) maximize current and future data use through strategic research design; (e) tailor data collection to participants' characteristics, preferences, and priorities; and (f) incorporate timeline mapping of personal and contemporaneous phenomena. DISCUSSION Public health measures taken to slow disease spread during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises may slow the pace of research and make its implementation all the more challenging. However, just-in-time qualitative research advances our understanding of the human experience and response to the COVID-19 and major public health crises. It also complements existing behavioral theory and research. The guidelines presented may assist researchers to initiate necessary qualitative research more rapidly, with fewer logistic challenges, and with methodological rigor. They may also help expand research on groups experiencing collateral effects of the pandemic and major public health crisis. Lastly, the guidelines may support the development of more robust data for alternate analysis at a later date.","output":"Just-in-Time Qualitative Research: Methodological Guidelines Based on the COVID-19 Pandemic Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently most researchers consider humanity's extermination of biodiversity as the antecedent of ideal conditions for the emergence of new viruses and diseases. Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour. The message is simple: we need to rethink our current relationship with nature and with ourselves, which should lead to a social transformation towards the sustainable use of the available resources.","output":"Deforestation hotspots, climate crisis, and the perfect scenario for the next epidemic: The Amazon time bomb"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Native American populations are systematically marginalized in the healthcare and public health workforce.

METHODS Novel series of 8-(proline/pyrazole)-substituted xanthine analogs has been synthesized. The affinity and selectivity of compounds to adenosine receptors have been assessed by radioligand binding studies. The synthesized compounds also showed good bronchospasmolytic properties (increased onset of bronchospasm; decreased duration of jerks) with 100% survival of animals in comparison to the standard drug. Besides, compound 8f & 9f showed good binding affinity in comparison to other synthesized compounds in the micromolar range. RESULTS The maximum binding affinity of these compounds was observed for A2B receptors, which is ~ 7 or 10 times higher as compared to A1, A2A and A3 receptors. The newly synthesized derivatives 8f, 9a-f, 17g-m, and 18g-m displayed significant protection against histamine aerosol induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs. CONCLUSION Newly synthesized proline/pyrazole based xanthines compounds showed a satisfactory binding affinity for adenosine receptor subtypes.

Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form, for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions, robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before they transform into an epidemic.","output":"Spatiotemporal dynamics in demography-sensitive disease transmission: COVID-19 spread in NY as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome which can be fatal, especially in elderly population, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface. Our results on the molecular differences in the binding between the two viruses can provide important inputs for development of appropriate antiviral treatments of the new viruses, addressing the necessity of ongoing pandemics.","output":"Elucidating the differences in the molecular mechanism of receptor binding between 2019-nCoV and the SARS-CoV viruses using computational tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These past months of the COVID pandemic have given us ample opportunity to reflect on the US health care system.

In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host microRNA (miRNA) populations in three human lung-derived cell lines, as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We did not detect any major and consistent differences in host miRNA levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we unexpectedly discovered a viral miRNA-like small RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a transcript. Its abundance ranges from low to moderate as compared to host miRNAs. vmiR-5p functionally associates with Argonaute proteins -- core components of the RNA interference pathway -- leading to downregulation of host transcripts. One such host messenger RNA encodes Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2 (BATF2), which is linked to interferon signaling. We demonstrate that vmiR-5p production relies on cellular machinery, yet is independent of Drosha protein, and is enhanced by the presence of a strong and evolutionarily conserved hairpin formed within the ORF7a sequence.

The inflammatory response in CF is characterized by excessive neutrophil influx to the airways, mainly due to the increased local production and retention of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. AREAS COVERED : We discuss how the chemokine IL-8 more than any other dominates the inflammatory profile of the airways in CF lung disease. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies are designed to correct the malfunctioning protein resulting from specific CFTR mutations. This review covers current evidence on the impact of CFTR impairment on levels of IL-8 and outlines the influence of effective CFTR modulation on inflammation in CF with a focus on cytokine production. Review of the literature was carried out using the PUBMED database, Google Scholar and The Cochrane Library databases, using several appropriate generic terms. EXPERT OPINION : Therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the defective CFTR protein have improved the outlook for CF. Accumulating studies on the effect of highly effective CFTR modulation on inflammation indicate an impact on IL-8 levels.

Modelling studies published since the COVID 19 pandemic was declared in March 2020 estimate that suicide rates will increase by anywhere between 1% to 145% globally in response to the pandemic and action needs to be taken. METHODS: A narrative literature review on high quality evidence sources limited to human studies and publications written in English language only has been used to examine the relationship of COVID 19 and existing mental illness or history of mental illness, suicide prevention strategies and changes in overall suicide rates. RESULTS: A total of 39 papers are summarised and grouped using the headings aetiological factors, proposed interventions to increase access and national policies to provide a framework for suicide prevention during pandemics such as COVID 19. This review indicates that 1) investing in active labour market programmes will result in a decreased suicide rate during times of high unemployment 2) People in low paid and casual jobs require specific support because they are most financially vulnerable during a pandemic related crisis 3) Women require specific support during a pandemic because of the type of employment they have and because they often carry a greater proportion of the domestic burden and are at increased risk of domestic violence during lockdown and crisis 4) Mental health and substance misuse services need to be appropriately funded and prioritised during and post pandemic, due to the associated increase in substance misuse during a pandemic causing worsening mental health and increased risk of suicide 5) National Suicide Prevention Strategies should be developed by all countries and should anticipate response to a range of disasters, including a pandemic 6) Suicide prevention is everybody's business and National Suicide Prevention Strategies should adopt a whole-systems approach including mental health services, primary care, social care, NGO's and other community stakeholders 7) Suicide is preventable 8) It is essential to prioritise suicide prevention strategies in the COVID and post-COVID period to ensure that lives are saved.

Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presentation of technique: The materials and assembly process of the novel \\"Corona Curtain\\" are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. Results: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. Conclusion: The new \\"Corona Curtain\\" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.

The aim of this study was to assess the degree of anxiety, depression, resilience, and other psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey involved medical healthcare workers at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (Tokyo, Japan) between April 22 and May 15, 2020. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and resilience was assessed using the Japanese versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Furthermore, we added original questionnaires comprising three factors: (i) anxiety and fear of infection and death; (ii) isolation and unreasonable treatment; and (iii) motivation and escape behavior at work. RESULTS: In total, 848 healthcare workers participated in this survey: 104 doctors, 461 nurses, 184 other co-medical staff, and 99 office workers. Among all participants, 85 (10.0%) developed moderate-to-severe anxiety disorder, and 237 (27.9%) developed depression. Problems with anxiety and fear of infection and death, isolation and unreasonable treatment, and motivation and escape from work were higher in the depression group than in the non-depression group (total CES-D score  16 points).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 22 medical students was recorded while performing five key tasks on the robotic surgical simulator: Instrument Control, Ball Placement, Spatial Control II, Fourth Arm Tissue Retraction, and Hands-on Surgical Training Tasks. All students completed the Surgery Task Load Index (SURG-TLX), which includes one domain for subjective assessment of distraction (scale: 1-20). Scores were divided into low (score 1-6, subjective label: 1), intermediate (score 7-12, subjective label: 2), and high distraction (score 13-20, subjective label: 3). These cut-off values were arbitrarily considered based on a verbal assessment of participants and experienced surgeons. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm was trained utilizing EEG recordings from the medical students and used to classify their distraction levels. The accuracy of our method was determined by comparing the subjective distraction scores on SURG-TLX and the results from the proposed classification algorithm.

While clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin regardless of diabetes history in patients with HFrEF, or sotagliflozin in those with HFrEF and concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the timing and practical integration of this class of therapies in practice is less well defined. We propose that these drugs are candidates for early, upfront administration to patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF and for patients hospitalized with HF. Growing evidence has established early benefits, with clinically meaningful reductions in clinical events that reach statistical significance within days to weeks, following dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, in diabetic patients, sotagliflozin initiation. Secondly, although major clinical trials have tested these drugs in patients already receiving background HF therapy, secondary analyses showed that their efficacy is independent of that.

Rather, they exert renal protective effects and reduce risk of hyperkalaemia, properties that favour initiation, tolerance and persistence of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Uninsured cancer survivors are at higher risk of poorer health outcomes than the insured due to limited access to preventative screening for secondary cancers. This study examines the rates of surveillance and screening of uninsured cancer survivors and compares to uninsured patients without a cancer history seen in free clinics. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively from electronic medical records and paper charts of patients from 10 free clinics between January 2016 and December 2018 in the Tampa Bay area. The prevalence of socioeconomic characteristics, cancer diagnoses, and screening practices were compared for cancer survivors and free clinic patients without a history of cancer. Study participants were determined to be eligible for cancer screenings based on the United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. RESULTS Out of 13 982 uninsured patients frequenting free clinics between 2016 and 2018, 402 (2.9%) had a documented history of cancer. Out of the 285 eligible cancer survivors, 44 (15.4%) had completed age-appropriate colon cancer screening. Among the 170 female cancer survivors, 75 (44.1%) had completed breast cancer screenings, and only 5.9% (59/246) had completed cervical cancer screenings. After adjusting for age, gender, race, salary, employment status, and household size, cancer survivors were more likely to undergo colorectal cancer screening (OR: 3.59, 95% CI: 2.10-6.15) and breast cancer screening (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.30-3.84) than patients without a cancer history. This difference was not seen for cervical cancer screening (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: .62-1.58). CONCLUSIONS Uninsured cancer survivors frequenting free clinics represent a unique population that is underrepresented in the medical literature. Our results suggest that uninsured survivors use screening services at higher rates when compared to uninsured patients without a reported cancer diagnosis. However, these rates are suboptimal when compared to national screening rates of insured cancer survivors.","output":"Preventative Cancer Screening Rates Among Uninsured Patients in Free Clinics: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Cancer Survivors and Non-cancer Survivors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection prevalence and immunity is cornerstones in the fight against CoViD-19 pandemic. For pandemic control, reliable assays for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are required. This pilot external quality assessment (EQA) scheme aimed to independently assess the participants' clinical performance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing, to identify shortcomings in clinical practice and to evaluate the suitability of the scheme format. Methods The EQA scheme consisted of eight serum samples with variable reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 intended for the analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies. Laboratories reported: (1) results for each sample and the respective method, (2) raw data from replicate testing of each sample. Results The 16 selected pilot EQA participants reported 294 interpreted results and 796 raw data results from replicate testing. The overall error rate for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM tests was 2.7, 6.9, and 16.7%, respectively. While the overall diagnostic specificity was rated as very high, sensitivity rates between 67 and 98% indicate considerable quality differences between the manufacturers, especially for IgA and IgM. Conclusions Even the results reported by the small number of participants indicate a very heterogeneous landscape of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological testing. Differences of available tests and the individual performance of laboratories result in a success rate of 57.1% with one laboratory succeeding for all three antibody-classes. These results are an incentive for laboratories to participate in upcoming open EQA schemes that are needed to achieve a harmonization of test results and to improve serological testing.","output":"Results of the first pilot external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody testing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is one of the most common potentially life-threatening endocrine complications in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

It also focuses on the pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis and management of this endocrinopathy in PLHIV. A literature review was conducted through Medline and Google Scholar search on the subject. EXPERT OPINION Physicians need to be aware of the endocrinological implications of HIV infection and its treatment, especially CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in the detection of AI, especially in PLHIV, as it may present insidiously with nonspecific signs and symptoms and may be potentially life threatening if left untreated. Patients with overt primary and secondary AI require glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Overt primary AI also necessitates mineralocorticoid replacement. On the other hand, the management of relative AI remains controversial. In order to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis during periods of stress, the short-term use of glucocorticoids may be necessary in relative AI.","output":"Adrenal insufficiency in HIV/AIDS: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In vivo establishment and long-term persistence of a heterogeneous memory or an adaptive NK cell pool represents a functional adaptation to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in humans.

This fully mature memory subset robustly and selectively expands in vitro in response to mAb-opsonized targets or ITP-derived platelets and displays superior CD16-dependent IFN production. Our work identifies opsonizing antibodies as a host-dependent factor that shapes HCMV-driven memory NK cell compartment. We first demonstrate that chronic exposure to auto-antibodies contributes to the establishment/expansion of a highly specialized and unique memory NK cell subset with distinct CD16-dependent functional capabilities.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed by local collaborators to 2,280 medical students across 148 medical schools in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and Venezuela using non-probability convenience sampling from June 22 to July 24, 2020. Students answered questions regarding teaching, internet use, COVID-19, physical and mental well-being. A multivariate logistic regression examined factors associated with depressed mood, insomnia, and headache. RESULTS: Academic teaching shifted to a virtual (67%, n=1,534) or hybrid environment (23%, n=531), whilst bedside teaching was suspended or cancelled (93%, n=2,120). Across all countries students were equally satisfied with the teaching modality, quantity, quality, and the evaluation system of in-person, hybrid, and online curricula. Negative changes in mental (40% (n=912) insomnia, 57% (n=1,300) emotional irritability, 47% (n=1,072) emotional instability, 41% (n=935) anhedonia, 40% (n=912) depressed mood) and physical (36% (n=821) headache, 57% (n=1,299) ocular tiredness, 49% (n=1,117) backache) health symptoms were frequently observed.

Since ASF was first reported in China in 2018, ASFV still exists and poses a potential threat to the current pig industry. Low-virulence and genotype I strains of ASFV have been reported in China, and the prevention and control of ASF is more complicated. Insufficient understanding of the interaction of ASFV with the host immune system hinders vaccine development. Physical barriers, nonspecific immune response and acquired immunity are the three barriers of the host against infection. To escape the innate immune response, ASFV invades monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, thereby inhibiting IFN expression, regulating cytokine expression and the bodys inflammatory response process. Meanwhile, in order to evade the adaptive immune response, ASFV inhibits antigen presentation, induces the production of non-neutralizing antibodies, and inhibits apoptosis. Recently, significant advances have been achieved in vaccine development around the world. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) based on artificially deleting specific virulence genes can achieve 100% homologous protection and partial heterologous protection. The key of subunit vaccines is identifying the combination of antigens that can effectively provide protection and selecting carriers that can effectively deliver the antigens.

Since neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 have been questioned, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 has a similar ictogenic potential to other respiratory non-neurotropic viruses. We conducted a retrospective study identifying 1141 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and 146 patients with H1N1/H3N2 pneumonia.

We detailed clinical, electroencephalographic, and neuroradiological features of each patient, together with the hypothesized pathogenesis of seizures. Previous epilepsy or pre-existing predisposing conditions (i.e., Alzheimers disease, stroke, cerebral neoplasia) were found in one-third of patients that experienced seizures, while two-thirds of patients had seizures without known risk factors other than pneumonia in both groups. The prevalence of pre-existing predisposing conditions and disease severity indexes was similar in SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1/H3N2 pneumonia, thus excluding they could act as potential confounders. Considering all the patients with viral pneumonia together, previous epilepsy (p < 0.001) and the need for ventilatory support (p < 0.001), but not the presence of pre-existing predisposing conditions (p = 0.290), were associated with seizure risk. Our study showed that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses share a similar ictogenic potential. In both these infections, seizures are rare but serious events, and can manifest without pre-existing predisposing conditions, in particular when pneumonia is severe, thus suggesting an interplay between disease severity and host response as a major mechanism of ictogenesis, rather than a virus-specific mechanism.","output":"Ictogenesis of viral pneumonia: A comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1/H3N2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective As neuropsychologists adopt virtual assessments in the context of COVID-19, the field is shifting toward teleneuropsychology. Comprehensive remote evaluations are proving to be feasible and reliable across domains, though traditional fine motor (FM) tests cannot be administered virtually. In the absence of direct FM measurement, this cross-sectional study considered whether universal FM recommendations are appropriate for patients with pediatric brain tumor (PBT). Method Dominant FM z-scores were obtained from 176 patients with PBT (x- age at diagnosis and evaluation = 7.3 and 12.8 years, respectively). There were no significant differences between Lafayette Grooved and Purdue Pegboard performances. FM differences between tumor location (46% infratentorial), chemotherapy (71.6%), and gender (52.3% male) were analyzed. Results The sample as a whole performed over 2 SDs below normative age expectations, t(175) = ?14.7, p < 0.0001), with more pronounced deficits among patients with infratentorial (x-= ? 2.4) than supratentorial (x-= ? 1.7) tumors, F(1,174) = 7.1, p = 0.008. Consistent with prior findings, patients performed worse when treated with chemotherapy (x-= ? 2.3) than without (x-= ? 1.7), F(1,174) = 16.2, p < 0.0001. Time since diagnosis was negatively correlated with FM performance r = ?0.27, p < 0.001. While gender differences were not apparent overall, post-hoc analyses revealed FM impairment in over 89% of males and 75% of females by middle school. Conclusions Given the likelihood of FM concerns (particularly by middle school), FM recommendations should be offered even in the absence of direct FM measurement for patients with PBT evaluated virtually.

To overcome the risk of missed diagnosis of head and neck cancers, before deleting the scheduled appointments, we have introduced a selection of the patients by examining the clinical presenting issue and previous medical history. The aim of this study is to show the effects of the abovementioned strategy on the diagnosis and management of laryngeal cancer. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Hospital software regarding the new diagnosis of laryngeal SCC in the periods from March 2020 to December 2020 during the pandemic (study group) and from March 2019 to December 2019 (control group) were collected. Data were compared regarding: TNM stage, time from first medical examination to histological diagnosis (Time-1), and time form histological diagnosis to beginning of treatments (Time-2). RESULTS: The final study group was composed by 19 laryngeal cancers, the control group by 25 cases. No significant differences were found in the tumour stage between the groups. In the study group, Time-1 was shorter (24 days versus 43 days, p = 0.012), while Time-2 in surgically-treated patients was longer (20 days versus 9 days, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, there was a dramatic lack of medical and nurse staff needed for surgical procedures. As consequence, the time between the diagnosis of malignancy and surgical treatment increased. In our unit, an efficient patient selection strategy to reschedule medical appointments avoided a dangerous shift toward higher laryngeal cancer stages.","output":"Reduction in healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Patient screening based on symptoms is an effective strategy for avoiding delayed laryngeal cancer diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the cases of 2 patients hospitalized in our intensive care unit with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 infection in whom brain MR imaging showed an unusual DWI pattern with nodular and ring-shaped lesions involving the periventricular and deep white matter.

The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.","output":"Full genome characterization of two novel Alpha-coronavirus species from Italian bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the responses of emergency medical service (EMS) systems to cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA in an area of South Korea. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of adult OHCA patients attended by EMS providers comparing the EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic to those during the pre-COVID-19 period. Propensity score matching was used to compare the survival rates, and logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the survival of OHCA patients. RESULTS: A total of 891 patients in the pre-COVID-19 group and 1,063 patients in the COVID-19 group were included in the final analysis. During the COVID-19 period, the EMS call time was shifted to a later time period (16:00C24:00, P < 0.001), and the presence of an initial shockable rhythm was increased (pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19, 7.97% vs. 11.95%, P = 0.004). The number of tracheal intubations decreased (5.27% vs. 1.22%, P < 0.001), and the use of mechanical chest compression devices (30.53% vs. 44.59%, P < 0.001) and EMS response time (median [quartile 1-quartile 3], 7 [5C10] vs. 8 [6C11], P < 0.001) increased. After propensity score matching, the survival at admission rate (22.52% vs. 18.24%, P = 0.025), survival to discharge rate (7.77% vs. 5.52%, P = 0.056), and favorable neurological outcome (5.97% vs. 3.49%, P < 0.001) decreased. In the propensity score matching analysis of the impact of COVID-19, odds ratios of 0.768 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592C0.995) for survival at admission and 0.693 (95% CI, 0.446C1.077) for survival to discharge were found. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 period, there were significant changes in the EMS responses to OHCA. These changes are considered to be partly due to social distancing measures. As a result, the proportion of patients with an initial shockable rhythm in the COVID-19 period was greater than that in the pre-COVID-19 period, but the final survival rate and favorable neurological outcome were lower.","output":"The Comparison of Emergency Medical Service Responses to and Outcomes of Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Area of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The unexpected COVID-19 crisis has disrupted medical education and patient care in unprecedented ways. Despite the challenges, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust \\"temporary\\" solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education, continuing medical education (CME) activities, residency and fellowship programs, specialty society meetings, and telemedicine, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to \\"business as usual\\" in the health-care sector. METHODS: This is a commentary is based on the limited available literature, online information, and the front-line experiences of the authors. RESULTS: COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients, virtual meetings with colleagues, and online interviews have been introduced, and many trainees are \\"techno-omnivores\\" who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now, and their use, practicality, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-to-face experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe, secure, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling, informed consent, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy, although it is likely that after the crisis, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits. LIMITATIONS: The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era.","output":"The Technological Impact of COVID-19 on the Future of Education and Health Care Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have restricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More severe 'lockdowns' have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus, they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becoming available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination. Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, severe lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns","output":"Optimal time to return to normality: parallel use of COVID-19 vaccines and circuit breakers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems across the world, there is a need for reducing the burden on medical staff via automated systems for patient screening Given the limited availability of testing kits with long turn-around test times and the exponentially increasing number of COVID-19 positive cases, X-rays offer an additional cheap and fast modality for screening COVID-19 positive patients, especially for patients exhibiting respiratory symptoms In this paper, we propose a solution based on a combination of deep learning and radiomic features for assisting radiologists during the diagnosis of COVID-19 The proposed system of CovidDiagnosis takes a chest X-ray image and passes it through a pipeline comprising of a model for lung isolation, followed by classification of the lung regions into four disease classes, namely Healthy, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis and COVID-19 To assist our classification framework, we employ embeddings of disease symptoms produced by the CheXNet network by creating an ensemble The proposed approach gives remarkable classification results on publicly available datasets of chest X-rays Additionally, the system produces visualization maps which highlight the symptoms responsible for producing the classification decisions This provides trustworthy and interpretable decisions to radiologists for the clinical deployment of CovidDiagnosis Further, we calibrate our network using temperature scaling to give confidence scores which are representative of true correctness likelihood ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"CovidDiagnosis: Deep Diagnosis of COVID-19 Patients Using Chest X-Rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic and recurrent infections occur commonly in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D) and increase patient morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes of the innate immune system that are critical in pathogen handling. Neutrophil responses to infection are dysregulated in diabetes, predominantly mediated by persistent hyperglycaemia; the chief biochemical abnormality in T1D and T2D. Therapeutically enhancing host immunity in diabetes to improve infection resolution is an expanding area of research. Individuals with diabetes are also at an increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting the need for re-invigorated and urgent focus on this field. The aim of this review is to explore the breadth of previous literature investigating neutrophil function in both T1D and T2D, in order to understand the complex neutrophil phenotype present in this disease and also to focus on the development of new therapies to improve aberrant neutrophil function in diabetes. Existing literature illustrates a dual neutrophil dysfunction in diabetes. Key pathogen handling mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are decreased in diabetes, weakening the immune response to infection. However, pro-inflammatory neutrophil pathways, mainly neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, extracellular ROS generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, are significantly upregulated, causing damage to the host and perpetuating inflammation. Reducing these proinflammatory outputs therapeutically is emerging as a credible strategy to improve infection resolution in diabetes, and also more recently COVID-19. Future research needs to drive forward the exploration of novel treatments to improve infection resolution in T1D and T2D to improve patient morbidity and mortality.","output":"A Bittersweet Response to Infection in Diabetes; Targeting Neutrophils to Modify Inflammation and Improve Host Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To describe the dynamics and forecast the main parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic, the time series of daily cases in the World Health Organization African Region (WHOAR) from February 26th to December 29th, 2020 was analyzed.

Students felt that older adults should be treated differently during the pandemic because they are seen as high risk or vulnerable. Furthermore, students felt that they needed to be more cautious around older adults because older adults need to be taken care of. Students expressed fear about transmitting the virus to older adults in their lives so chose to isolate from grandparents or avoid older adults in the community in an effort to keep them safe. Finally, examples of negative and positive ageism were present in responses. Negative ageism was seen in comments about how older adults were going to die anyway, the assumption that older adults need more help, and the belief that older adults should be staying home during the pandemic. Positive ageism was present where students realized the importance of their relationships with the older adults in their lives.

If the government decides to impose a lockdown, it has to determine its intensity, timing and duration. We find that there are two competing effects that push the decision in opposite directions. An early lockdown is beneficial not only to slow down the spread of the disease, but creates beneficial habit formation (such as social distancing, developing hygienic habits) that persists even after the lockdown is lifted. Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information about the virulence and spread of the disease in the population in addition to a direct cost to the economy. Based on the prior probability of the disease being virulent, we characterize the timing, intensity and duration of a lockdown with the above mentioned tradeoffs. Specifically, we show that as the precision of learning goes up, a government tends to delay the imposition of lockdown.

METHODS: In this study, 102 patients (616 sessions of ECT) were studied. Demographic and clinical data (age, gender, receiving or not receiving medications that affected the seizure threshold, the total number of ECT sessions, clinical severity of admission scores, clinical diagnosis, propofol dose, seizure duration, and AETI) were collected in special forms and analyzed by appropriate statistical methods. RESULTS: Sessions with long-term AETI had longer seizure time than sessions with short-term AETI (33.47  8.46 vs. 28.68  9.74, P value < 0.05). The duration of seizures was significantly longer in the group with long AETI in sessions 1, 2, and 4 than in the other group (P value < 0.05). There was a significant relationship between the duration of seizures and propofol dose, AETI, and receiving drugs effective in the seizure threshold (P value < 0.05).

MIS-C might be an inflammatory disease distinct from KD resulting from an exaggerated immune response. A high prevalence of mucocutaneous manifestations - in addition to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular involvements - was found in MIS-C. The most frequent mucocutaneous findings were conjunctivitis and rash, often described as macular and/or papular or polymorphous. In this article, we present a brief overview of MIS-C with an emphasis on mucocutaneous findings and the relationship with KD.","output":"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19: A Review with an Emphasis on Mucocutaneous and Kawasaki Disease-Like Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poor growth and/or weight gain was identified in the initial reports of children with AIDS (Oleske et al. 1983, Rubinstein et al. 1983). However, in the past 12 years little progress has been made to understand the mechanisms for these observations. Data from the NIAID/NICHD multicenter Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS) demonstrated that a decline in weight occurred in the first four months of life followed by decreased linear growth (Rich et al. 1993). In older children weight and height seem to decline in parallel (McKinney et al. 1993), but loss of lean body mass may occur prior to a decline in weight (Miller et al. 1993). Adequate caloric intake can improve weight gain, but has little effect on height velocity and lean body mass (Henderson et al. 1994, Miller et al. 1992). Long-term survivors with HIV infection are shorter than anticipated, and these changes cannot be explained solely by inadequate nutrition or by endocrine abnormalities. The immune system, gastrointestinal tract function, malnutrition, and chronic or recurrent infection interact and contribute to the nutritional deficiencies and problems with growth observed in the HIV-infected child.","output":"Gastrointestinal Tract Function and Malnutrition in HIV-Infected Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intricate interplay between novel lattice geometry and spontaneous symmetry-breaking states is at the forefront of contemporary research on quantum materials.

The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolution of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players social activities. We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop a structure-preserving approximation technique to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.","output":"Herd Behaviors in Epidemics: A Dynamics-Coupled Evolutionary Games Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals has been related to close contact with humans diagnosed with COVID-19. Objectives: To assess the exposure, infection, and persistence by SARS-CoV-2 of dogs and cats living in the same households of humans that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate clinical and laboratory alterations associated with animal infection. METHODS: Animals living with COVID-19 patients were longitudinally followed and had nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal and rectal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, blood samples were collected for laboratory analysis, and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT(90)) to investigate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Between May and October 2020, 39 pets (29 dogs and 10 cats) of 21 patients were investigated. Nine dogs (31%) and four cats (40%) from 10 (47.6%) households were infected with or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Animals tested positive from 11 to 51 days after the human index COVID-19 case onset of symptoms. Three dogs tested positive twice within 14, 30, and 31 days apart. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in one dog (3.4%) and two cats (20%). In this study, six out of thirteen animals either infected with or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 have developed mild but reversible signs of the disease. Using logistic regression analysis, neutering, and sharing bed with the ill owner were associated with pet infection.

Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs. F. nucleatum was only taken up by DCs when in consortium with P. gingivalis. Mature consortium regressed DC maturation upon uptake, as determined by flow cytometry. Analysis of dental plaques of PD and healthy subjects by 16s rRNA confirmed oral colonization with consortium members, but DC hematogenous spread was limited to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Expression of P. gingivalis mfa1 fimbriae was increased in dental plaques and hematogenous DCs of PD patients.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is validated with limits of detection (LoDs) of 0.34 ng/mL (7.44 pM) and 0.14 ng/mL (2.96 pM) in 1 PBS and artificial saliva, respectively. The specificity is inspected with types of antigens, exhibiting low cross-reactivity among MERS-CoV, Influenza A virus, and Influenza B virus. This portable system is embedded with Bluetooth communication and user-friendly interfaces that are fully compatible with digital health, feasibly leading to an on-site turnaround, an effective management, and a proactive response taken by medical providers and frontline health workers.","output":"Saliva-based COVID-19 detection: a rapid antigen test of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein using an electrical-double-layer gated field-effect transistor-based biosensing system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the mediating role of work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict between the Big Five personality traits and mental health thereby enhancing theoretical development based upon empirical evidence. Integrating Conservation of Resources theory with the self-medication hypothesis, we conducted a mega-meta analytic path analysis examining the relationships among employees Big Five traits, work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, anxiety and depression, and substance use. We produced a ten-by-ten synthetic correlation matrix from existing meta-analytic bivariate relationships to test our sequential mediation model. Results from our path analysis model showed that agreeableness and conscientiousness predicted substance use via mediated paths through both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict and sequentially through depression as well as through family-to-work conflict followed by anxiety. Extroversion and openness-to-experience had relatively weaker influences on substance use through work-to-family conflict, anxiety, and depression. Neuroticism was the strongest driver of the two forms of conflict, the two mental health conditions, and substance use. From this model it can be inferred that work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict may be generative mechanisms by which the impact of personality is transmitted to mental health outcomes and then to substance use when analyzed via a Conservation of Resources theory lens.","output":"Antecedents and outcomes of work-family conflict: A mega-meta path analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world and it is affecting the whole society. The current gold standard test for screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray. Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A (1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763 non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19), respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and 184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model, which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for better outcomes.","output":"Multi-Channel Transfer Learning of Chest X-ray Images for Screening of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keadaan latar belakang ekonomi para wali santri rata-rata menengah kebawah sehingga tidak semua santri mampu membayar iuran bulanan yang dibebankan oleh pengurus yayasan.

One hundred and twenty-two community-dwelling elderly people aged  65 were randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi or a Tai Chi plus CBI group. Participants' level of fear of falling, physical mobility, self-perceived personal wellbeing and social participation were compared before and after completing the 8-week intervention and then at a 2-month follow-up. The findings showed that Tai Chi both with and without CBI had a similar effect on reducing elderly people's fear of falling, but only Tai Chi plus CBI had a positive effect on participants' self-perceived personal wellbeing. Tai Chi both with and without CBI had no effect on participants' self-perceived social participation and mobility. Apart from a slight improvement in participants' self-perceived personal wellbeing, other outcome effects were similar for Tai Chi with and without CBI. This finding raises a question about the additive effects of combined intervention over Tai Chi alone in reducing elderly people's fear of falling.

Its use, however, is limited by its rare but severe ophthalmological complications. Here, we aimed to analyse factors associated with HCQ retinopathy including HCQ blood levels. METHODS: This caseCcontrol study compared SLE patients with and without HCQ retinopathy, defined by abnormal results for at least two of the following ophthalmological tests: automated visual fields, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and fundus autofluorescence. We compared clinical and laboratory findings to assess risk factors for HCQ retinopathy. RESULTS: The study included 23 patients with confirmed retinopathy (cases) and 547 controls. In the univariate analysis, age (P < 0.001), height (P = 0.045), creatinine clearance (P < 0.001), haemoglobin concentration (P = 0.01), duration of HCQ intake, (P < 0.001), higher cumulative HCQ dose (P < 0.001) and geographical origin (West Indies and sub-Saharan Africa) (P = 0.007) were associated with the risk of retinopathy, while HCQ blood levels were not. In the multivariate analysis, only cumulative dose (P = 0.016), duration of intake (P = 0.039), creatinine clearance (P = 0.002) and geographical origin (P < 0.0001, odds ratio 8.7) remained significantly associated with retinopathy. CONCLUSION: SLE patients on HCQ should be closely monitored for retinopathy, especially those from the West Indies or sub-Saharan Africa, or with renal insufficiency, longer HCQ intake or a high cumulative dose. Although reducing the daily dose of HCQ in patients with persistently high HCQ blood levels seems logical, these concentrations were not associated with retinopathy in this study with controls adherent to treatment.","output":"Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus: a caseCcontrol study with hydroxychloroquine blood-level analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 related fears and marital adjustment on distress in pregnant women. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive study. The sample of the study consisted of 161 pregnant women who were followed up in a private hospital in Ankara between May and September 2020. Sociodemographic data form, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS), and Marital Adjustment Scale (MAS) were used in the study. Results: The mean age of the pregnant women in the sample was 29.64 +/- 4.47 years. While the rate of chronic disease was 8.7% (n=14), the rate of psychiatric disease was 2.5% (n=4). 7.5% (n=12) of the sample described their current pregnancy as unwanted pregnancy. The negative affect sub-dimension scores of TPDS were predicted by the FCV-19S score (beta=0.473, p<0.001) and the desired state of pregnancy (beta=0.147, p=0.036). The total score of the MAS (beta=0.480, p<0.001), the desirability of pregnancy (beta=-0.253, p<0.001), and the total scores of the FCV-19S (beta=0.239, p<0.001) predicted the sub-dimension score of partner involvement. Conclusion: One of the important sources of distress in pregnant women is fear of COVID-19.

The local epidemic of dengue in Guangdong is suspected to be triggered by imported cases and results in consequent seasonal transmission. However, the comprehensive epidemiological characteristics of dengue in Guangdong are still unclear. METHODS: The epidemiology, seroprevalence, molecular evolution of dengue virus, and the development of policies and strategies on the prevention and control of dengue were analyzed in Guangdong, China from 1978 to 2017. FINDINGS: Seasonal transmission of dengue virus in Guangdong, China was mainly sustained from July to October of each year. August to September was the highest risk period of local dengue outbreaks. Most of the dengue cases in Guangdong were young and middle-aged adults. Five hundred and three fatal cases were recorded, which declined within the last two decades (n = 10). The serological test of healthy donors' serum samples showed a positive rate of 5.77%. Dengue virus 1C4 (DENV 1C4) was detected in Guangdong from 1978 to 2017. DENV 1 was the dominant serotype of dengue outbreaks from 1978 to 2017, with an increasing tendency of DENV 2 since 2010. Local outbreaks of DENV 3 were rare. DENV 4 was only encountered in imported cases in Guangdong, China. The imported cases were the main source of outbreaks of DENV 1C2. Early detection, management of dengue cases, and precise vector control were the key strategies for local dengue prevention and control in Guangdong, China. INTERPRETATION: Dengue has not become an endemic arboviral disease in Guangdong, China. Early detection, case management, and implementation of precise control strategies are key findings for preventing local dengue transmission, which may serve for countries still struggling to combat imported dengue in the west pacific areas.","output":"Dengue and Dengue Virus in Guangdong, China, 1978C2017: Epidemiology, Seroprevalence, Evolution, and Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Humoral response to the SARS-COV-2 vaccines needs to be evaluated in the fragile population of patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

RESULTS: Among the 90 vaccinated HD patients (mean age 69 years, 61% male), 19 (21%) had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A seroconversion with anti-S IgG antibodies (Sab) was documented in 20% of patients after the first dose (early responders) and in 77% after the second dose, while 23% were non-responders. Cardiac disease, cirrhosis and gamma-globulin levels were independently predictive of the absence of seroconversion. Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) were detected in 15% of early responders after the first dose, and in 90% of early responders and 58% of late responders after the second dose. Sab titers after the second dose were higher in patients with Nab than without Nab (598 [IQR, 246-882] versus 134 [IQR, 61-390], p < 0.0001). All patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed both Sab and Nab, and their titers of Sab and Nab were higher than in late responders CONCLUSIONS: Most HD patients develop a substantial humoral response against SARS-COV2, with neutralizing antibodies, following the mRNA vaccine.

Methods: Most models for projections of the spread and lethality of COVID-19 take into account the ambient temperature, neglecting light. Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of COVID-19 have shown that it causes a systemic infection that significantly affects the hematopoietic system and hemostasis, factors extremely dependent of light, mainly in the region of visible and infrared radiation. Results: In the COVID-19 patients hemoglobin is decreasing and protoporphyrin is increasing, generating an extremely harmful accumulation of iron ions in the bloodstream, which are able to induce an intense inflammatory process in the body with a consequent increase in C-reactive protein and albumin. Observing the unsaturation characteristics of the cyclic porphyrin ring allows it to absorb and emit radiation mainly in the visible region. This characteristic can represent an important differential to change this process in the event of an imbalance in this system, through the photobiomodulation to increase the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using red and near-infrared radiation (R-NIR) and vitamin D using ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. These two compounds have the primary role of activating the defense mechanisms of the immune system, enabling greater resistance of the individual against the attack by the virus. According to the theory of electron excitation in photosensitive molecules, similar to hemoglobin heme, after the photon absorption there would be an increase in the stability of the iron ion bond with the center of the pyrrole ring, preventing the losses of heme function oxygen transport (HbO2). The light is also absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in the R-NIR region, with a consequent increase in electron transport, regulating enzyme activity and resulting in a significant increase of oxygen rate consumption by mitochondria, increasing ATP production. Conclusions: The most favorable range of optical radiation to operate in this system is between R-NIR region, in which cytochrome c oxidase and porphyrin present absorption peaks centered at 640 nm and HbO2 with absorption peak centered at 900 nm. Based on the mechanisms described earlier, our hypothesis is that light could reduce the lethality of COVID-19.","output":"Photobiomodulation: Shining Light on COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since spring 2020, the wide-ranging contact restriction measures in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have also led to a reduction in physicianCpatient contacts in the ambulatory care setting.

Also, all economic consequences for the treated patient (production loss) and caregiver (health loss) are not always considered. The perspective chosen can have a major impact on the outcome of the analysis. A vaccine for COVID-19 is estimated to provide a value of 744C956 per dose when using a societal perspective including broader consequences for the population. Providing a complete and appropriate picture of the value of vaccination is of importance to allocate resources efficiently, to provide incentives for vaccine development, and to show the cost of delaying decisions to implement a new vaccine.","output":"Acceptance and application of a broad population health perspective when evaluating vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore mechanistic benefits of glucose-lowering agents that extend beyond glycemic control with the potential to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications. DATA SOURCES: The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases.

Like other techniques, urethrocutaneous fistulae and stricture continues to be the most common complications, in addition to other complications, which could be attributed to the compromise in flaps vascularity. Some authors describe a technique that resolves some of these problems by combining the unique benefits of the double faced preputial flaps. The aim of this study:- to evaluate double faced preputial onlay island flap technique for complications rate, outcomes of surgical procedure, and cosmetic results in comparison to transverse inner preputial flap technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized controlled study that included 68 patients with anterior, mid-penile, and posterior penile hypospadias, with shallow and narrow urethral plate of size less than 6 mm, who underwent single-stage repair using preputial flaps, conducted at the department of pediatric surgery (Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt), between May 2019 and October 2021, to evaluate double faced transverse preputial onlay island flap technique. Thirty-four patients underwent double faced transverse preputial onlay island flap (group A) and another 34 patients underwent inner transverse preputial onlay island flap (control group) (group B). The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 26 months. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 20.5% (14 of 68 children). Complications developed in 5 cases (14.7%) in group A who underwent double face onlay island flap (2 glannular dehiscence, 1 penile rotation, 1 fistula, and 1 diverticulum), as opposed to 9 patients in group B (26.4%) who underwent transverse inner preputial flap (3 developed glannular dehiscence, 2 skin flap necrosis, 3 fistulae, and 1 diverticulum). After management of the complications, all patients had good surgical outcomes with satisfactory cosmetic results. CONCLUSION: Double faced transverse preputial onlay island flap is an alternative option to reconstruct narrow urethral plate hypospadias.

Registry-based studies with nationwide coverage may reveal the full burden of socioeconomic inequality compared to what can be captured in questionnaire-based studies. We examined the incidence of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) according to socioeconomic status and age. METHODS: We used national registries to identify patients with an incident diagnosis of ALD and their socioeconomic status in 2009C2018 in Denmark. We computed ALD incidence rates by socioeconomic status (education and employment status) and age-group (30C39, 40C49, 50C59, 60C69 years) and quantified the inequalities as the absolute and relative difference in incidence rates between low and high socioeconomic status. FINDINGS: Of 17,473 patients with newly diagnosed ALD, 78% of whom had cirrhosis, 86% had a low or medium-low educational level and only 20% were employed. ALD patients were less likely to be employed in the 10 years prior to diagnosis than controls. The incidence rate of ALD correlated inversely with educational level, from 181 (95% CI, 167C197) to 910 (95% CI, 764C1086) per million person-years from the highest to the lowest educational level. By employment status, the incidence rate per million person-years was 211 (95% CI, 189C236) for employed and 3449 (95% CI, 2785C4271) for unemployed. Incidence rates increased gradually with age leading to larger inequalities in absolute numbers for older age-groups. Although ALD was rare in the younger age-groups, the relative differences in incidence rates between high and low socioeconomic status were large for these ages. The pattern of socioeconomic inequality in ALD incidence was similar for men and women. INTERPRETATION: This study showed substantial socioeconomic inequalities in ALD incidence for people aged 30C69 years.

Currently, the regulatory mechanisms controlling RIG-I activation remain to be fully elucidated. Here we show that the FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) facilitates RIG-I activation. FIP200 deficiency impaired RIG-I signaling and increased host susceptibility to RNA virus infection. In vivo studies further demonstrated FIP200 knockout mice were more susceptible to RNA virus infection due to the reduced innate immune response. Mechanistic studies revealed that FIP200 competed with the helicase domain of RIG-I for interaction with the two tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD), thereby facilitating the release of 2CARD from the suppression status. Furthermore, FIP200 formed a dimer and facilitated 2CARD oligomerization, thereby promoting RIG-I activation.

METHODS: Patients with acute appendicitis admitted to Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital between February and June 2019 and February and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were grouped according to admission year. The demographic characteristics, present illnesses, medical history, symptoms and signs, comorbidities, blood test results, imaging data, appendix pathology, and treatment details were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 74 patients received nonsurgical treatment and 113 patients underwent surgical treatment in group 2019, whereas 159 patients received nonsurgical treatment and 26 patients received surgical treatment in group 2020. Fever, thick appendix, nonsurgical management, and uncomplicated appendicitis (simple or supportive appendicitis) were more common in group 2020 (P < 0.05). Among the nonsurgical management cases, the neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and recurrence rate were higher in group 2020 (P < 0.05).

Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes decreased (18.3% vs. 9.9% p = 0.002) as well as atrial fibrillation episodes (29.2% vs. 22.4% p = 0.019). In contrast, heart failure (HF) alarm activation was lower in 2019 than in 2020 (17% vs. 25.3% p = 0.012). Hospital admissions for critical events recorded with CIEDs dropped in 2020, including those for HF. Conclusions: HM, combined with telemedicine use, has ensured the surveillance of CIED patients. In 2020, arrhythmic events and hospital admissions decreased significantly compared to 2019. Moreover, in 2020, patients with HF arrived in hospital in a worse clinical condition compared to previous months.","output":"Home Management of Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients with Cardiac Devices during Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden transition to online instruction mid-semester at traditional, residential colleges and universities due to the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for students and faculty. Two sets of surveys, sent five weeks apart, were distributed to faculty and students at a small, southeastern, public university in the USA to analyze faculty and student perceptions and experiences of the abrupt move to online instruction. Findings indicate that students and faculty agreed that the move to online instruction was necessary and that online learning is less effective than face-to-face instruction. Faculty, however, misjudged the degree to which students were concerned about balancing work, school, and family obligations and changes to course material. Differences in perceptions and experiences between faculty and students reflect their different roles and statuses within the institution.

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlations among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. METHODS To address the issues of model explainability and label correlations, we propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS (National Health Service) COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare the HLAN model and label embedding initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods, including variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RESULTS HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and F1 on the top-50 code prediction, 91.9% and 64.1%, respectively; and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models: around 97% Micro-level AUC. More importantly, in the analysis of model explanations, by highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to the CNN-based models and its downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Label embedding (LE) initialisation significantly boosted the previous state-of-the-art model, CNN with attention mechanisms, on the full code prediction to 52.5% Micro-level F1. The analysis of the layers initialised with label embeddings further explains the effect of this initialisation approach. The source code of the implementation and the results are openly available at https://github.com/acadTags/Explainable-Automated-Medical-Coding. CONCLUSION We draw the conclusion from the evaluation results and analyses. First, with hierarchical label-wise attention mechanisms, HLAN can provide better or comparable results for automated coding to the state-of-the-art, CNN-based models. Second, HLAN can provide more comprehensive explanations for each label by highlighting key words and sentences in the discharge summaries, compared to the n-grams in the CNN-based models and the downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Third, the performance of deep learning based multi-label classification for automated coding can be consistently boosted by initialising label embeddings that captures the correlations among labels. We further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the overall method regarding its potential to be deployed to a hospital and suggest areas for future studies.","output":"Explainable Automated Coding of Clinical Notes using Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Networks and Label Embedding Initialisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) were considered clinically vulnerable & asked to shield. A national scheme supported purchase of spirometers enabling pwCF to do home spirometry to support virtual clinics. PwCFattending the York Hull adult CF centre (YHACFC) were provided with NuvoAir spirometers. Objectives: To evaluate how the change from clinic to home spirometry impacted on the experiences of pwCF & clinicians, focusing on anxiety levels & use of time. Methods: Online questionnaires were sent to pwCF & clinicians at YHACFC. Mock scenarios established potential differences in time taken for home spirometry (HS) & clinic spirometry (CS). Results: 28/70 pwCF & 8/15 clinicians responded. PwCF & clinicians were confident that pwCF could use HS. Frequently used words for both groups were quick, convenient & easy when describing HS. When describing CS, expertise & helpful featured for pwCF and time, stressful & accurate for clinicians. PwCF reported the main benefit of CS was regular contact with clinicians. 62.5% of clinicians agreed that the change to HS gave better time efficiency & 87.5% agreed clinic flow was more efficient with HS. Timed scenarios indicated 7? minutes per test saved with HS. Most clinicians believed pwCF are anxious with spirometry, 50% linking anxiety to the clinic setting. Most pwCF reported never being anxious about HS or CS. Only 4% reported anxiety with CS;however, when describing CS, the words anxious & worry were used frequently. The preference for 82% of pwCF for future care was access to a combination of spirometry in the home & clinic. Conclusion: ? Home spirometry saved time for pwCF & clinicians. ? Virtual technology has an important & developing role in the care of pwCF but relationships remain valued. ? Style of questioning affects response from pwCF about spirometry anxiety. ?

Currently, all adults in the Unites States now have access to one of three COVID-19 vaccines. As part of the vaccination procedure, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact sheets, which contain information regarding the vaccine, are provided. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ease of reading (i.e., readability) of the EUA-approved fact sheets for the vaccines currently available in the United States, the V-Safe adverse event survey script, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website information on COVID-19 vaccines designed for the general public in the United States. METHODS: We acquired the Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen EUA fact sheets, as well as the V-Safe survey script and the CDC website information regarding COVID-19 vaccines. These documents were analyzed for their complexity regarding the following readability factors: average length of paragraphs, sentences, and words; font size and style; use of passive voice; the Gunning-Fog index; the Flesch Reading Ease index; and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index. RESULTS: Only the V-Safe adverse-event survey script met readability standards for adequate comprehension. The mean readability scores of the EUA fact sheets and the CDC website were as follows: Flesch Reading Ease score (44.35 avg); Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.48 avg); and Gunning-Fog index (11.8 avg). These scores indicate that at least a 10th-grade level education would be required to understand these reading materials. CONCLUSION: The average person in the United States would have difficulty understanding the information provided in the EUA fact sheets and CDC COVID-19 vaccine website documents; however, the V-Safe survey was written at an adequate reading level.

The current paper presents a synthesis of review literature discussing the application of behaviour change theories within an infectious disease and emergency response context, with a view to informing infectious disease modelling, research and public health practice. METHODS: A scoping review procedure was adopted for the searches. Searches were run on PubMed, PsychInfo and Medline with search terms covering four major categories: behaviour, emergency response (e.g., infectious disease, preparedness, mass emergency), theoretical models, and reviews. Three further top-up reviews was also conducted using Google Scholar. Papers were included if they presented a review of theoretical models as applied to understanding preventative health behaviours in the context of emergency preparedness and response, and/or infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS: Thirteen papers were included in the final synthesis. Across the reviews, several theories of behaviour change were identified as more commonly cited within this context, specifically, Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Protection Motivation Theory, with support (although not universal) for their effectiveness in this context. Furthermore, the application of these theories in previous primary research within this context was found to be patchy, and so further work is required to systematically incorporate and test behaviour change models within public health emergency research and interventions. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review identifies a range of more commonly applied theories with broad support for their use within an infectious disease and emergency response context. The Discussion section details several key recommendations to help researchers, practitioners, and infectious disease modellers to incorporate these theories into their work. Specifically, researchers and practitioners should base future research and practice on a systematic application of theories, beginning with those reported herein. Furthermore, infectious disease modellers should consult the theories reported herein to ensure that the full range of relevant constructs (cognitive, emotional and social) are incorporated into their models. In all cases, consultation with behavioural scientists throughout these processes is strongly recommended to ensure the appropriate application of theory.","output":"Examining the application of behaviour change theories in the context of infectious disease outbreaks and emergency response: a review of reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stretchable electronics that can elongate elastically as well as flex are crucial to a wide range of emerging technologies, such as wearable medical devices, electronic skin, and soft robotics.

At present, the clinical treatment for EC is based mainly on radical surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, due to the limited efficacy of conventional treatments and the serious adverse reactions, the outcome is still unsatisfactory (the 5-year survival rate for patients is less than 25%). Thus, it is extremely important and urgent to identify new therapeutic targets. The concept of tumor microenvironment (TME) has attracted increased attention since it was proposed. Recent studies have shown that TME is an important therapeutic target for EC. Microenvironment-targeting therapies such as immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy have played an indispensable role in prolonging survival and improving the prognosis of patients with EC. In addition, many new drugs and therapies that have been developed to target microenvironment may become treatment options in the future.

Large-scale open online courses are gradually increasing with the continued spread of COVID-19 all around the world, which has also attracted more and more adults to participate in such courses. However, despite the fact that the research on adult online learning is abundant, there is still a lack of systematic summaries that can guide the design and selection of course content and instructional methods. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically examine the factors and related strategies that influence adult online learning, and to some extent also provide directions for future research. Using a systematic literature review, with the help of literature visualization software CiteSpace, this study summarized and analyzed 124 SSCI literature of empirical studies. The findings show that although some conclusions of adult online learning research are controversial, there is still some consensus, which is worthy of our attention. First, adult learners have time constraints and more responsibilities, hence life oriented, structured, and flexible online courses are more suitable for them. Secondly, adult learners have less scholastic aptitude and are less ICT skilled than normal students, so preparatory learning is necessary. Finally, in terms of an online instructional approach, integrated online discussions are recommended, as adults are prone to inefficient and superficial discussions in open discussions.

COVID-19 emerged from Wuhan, China, in late 2019. A new strain of coronavirus was not previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which cause illness ranging from a mild cold to severe disease. Since the alarm was first raised in China, COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the globe. Initially deemed as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), it was later declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Nations have been striving to flatten the curve, so as to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and reduce the number of deaths. Globally we have had to get to grip with diagnosing, treating, and navigating this novel coronavirus path in a time-critical manner. Methods: Informed by a retrospective review of the body of COVID-19 literature, first-hand clinical experience and overarching public and global health principles, we propose the key clinical challenges faced in the fight against COVID-19. These will be explored, with current and potential informatics solutions elaborated upon. We will study healthcare systems and how information has been transformed within these during the pandemic. Results: We have identified key clinical challenges faced in the wake of COVID-19. These challenges invariably vary between countries;however, no country has been without challenge. The key challenges identified were testing and laboratory capacity;understanding presentations of COVID-19;rapid formulation of treatment guidelines and dissemination of these;contact tracing;use of technology for communication;human resources;personal protective equipment supplies;information sharing within the scientific community;running clinical trials;finding a vaccine;increasing hospital capacity;ensuring appropriate use of healthcare facilities;secondary impacts, e.g. delayed presentation;misinformation;use of infographics;training of healthcare professionals;performing aerosol-generating procedures;and quarantining clinical areas. Conclusions: In the midst of a global health emergency, we have identified and addressed many clinical challenges. We have adapted rapidly out of necessity. Lessons have been learned, and future challenges will arise. We must reflect on our progress and failings thus far, to ensure maximum learning. Recommendations for future pandemics are open information sharing, knowledge hubs which are easily accessible, a continuous commitment to analyse and learn from our actions and the pursuit of innovative solutions utilising informatics. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Innovative Solutions to the Clinical Challenges of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Starting in 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to require all cigarette packages in the US to display graphic health warnings depicting health harms associated with smoking. The FDA originally planned to implement such warnings in 2012, but tobacco industry litigation delayed the effort. OBJECTIVE: To assess the estimated population health outcomes associated with a policy requiring graphic health warnings on cigarette packages in the US and with a 10-year delay in implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model used simulation modeling of smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable mortality in the US from 2012 to 2100, using the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network smoking population model. The study was conducted from October 2020 to July 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were annual adult smoking prevalence, smoking-attributable deaths averted, and life-years gained vs the baseline scenario. A baseline scenario assuming no graphic health warnings was compared with expected outcomes of implementing graphic health warnings in 2022 vs 2012. Policy effects were considered under varying assumptions of the association of the policy with smoking initiation and cessation, ranging from most conservative to most optimistic. A maximum smoking reduction scenario in which all smoking would stop by the end of 2022 was evaluated. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, an estimated 13.2 million smoking-attributable deaths would have occurred from 2012 to 2100. Under a maximum smoking-reduction scenario, 5.5 million of these deaths would be averted. Implementation of graphic health warnings from 2022 to 2100 would be associated with 539 000 (range, 275 000-794 000) smoking-attributable deaths averted and 7.9 million (range, 4.0-11.6 million) life-years gained, representing less than 10% of the 5.5 million estimated smoking-attributable deaths averted and 81.8 million life-years gained in the maximum smoking-reduction scenario. Implementation from 2012 to 2100 would be associated with 33.2% (range, 32.9%-33.5%) more deaths averted (718 000; range, 365 000 to 1.1 million) and 42.7% (range, 42.3%-43.1%) more life-years gained (11.2 million; range, 5.7-16.6 million) compared with implementation in 2022. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This decision analytical model estimated that FDA cigarette graphic health warnings, if implemented in 2022, would be associated with public health benefits. The model also estimated that more smoking-attributable deaths would have been averted if the policy had been implemented in 2012.

Using a retroviral expression vector, two fusion proteins were expressed in rat pituitary (GH3) cells: a control protein consisting of the beta-lactamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee alpha-globin (142 amino acids); and a chimera of the somatostatin signal peptide and proregion (82 amino acids) fused to alpha-globin. Control globin was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as determined by accurate cleavage of its signal peptide; however, alpha- globin was not secreted but was rapidly and quantitatively degraded intracellularly with a t 1/2 of 4-5 min. Globin degradation was insensitive to chloroquine, a drug which inhibits lysosomal proteases, but was inhibited at 16 degrees C suggesting proteolysis occurred during transport to the cis-Golgi apparatus. In contrast to the control globin, approximately 30% of the somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein was transported to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus where it was endoproteolytically processed. Processing of the chimera occurred in an acidic intracellular compartment since cleavage was inhibited by 25 microM chloroquine. 60% of the transported chimera was cleaved at the Arg-Lys processing site in native prosomatostatin yielding \\"mature\\" alpha-globin. Most significantly, approximately 50% of processed alpha-globin was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP. We conclude that the somatostatin propeptide mediated transport of alpha-globin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network by protecting molecules from degradation and in addition, facilitated packaging of alpha-globin into vesicles whose secretion was stimulated by cAMP.","output":"The propeptide of preprosomatostatin mediates intracellular transport and secretion of alpha-globin from mammalian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: By the end of March 2020, more than a fifth of the worlds population was in various degrees of lockdown in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 This enforced confinement led some to liken lockdown to imprisonment We directly compared individuals experiences of lockdown with prisoners experiences of imprisonment in order to determine whether psychological parallels can be drawn between these two forms of confinement Methods: Online surveys of adults in lockdown in the UK (N = 300) and California (N = 450) were conducted 4 and 5 weeks into lockdown in each region, respectively The UK data was then compared to Souza and Dhamis (2010) sample of 267 medium security prisoners in England, and the Californian data was compared to Dhami et al s (2007) sample of 307 medium security Federal prisoners in California We measured the effects of Group (Lockdown v Prison) on five categories of dependent variables (i e , activity, social contact, thoughts, feelings, and rule-breaking), controlling for demographic differences between the groups Results: In both regions, people in lockdown thought significantly less often about missing their freedom, as well as missing their family and friends living elsewhere than did first-time prisoners However, people in lockdown in both regions were also significantly less engaged in a range of daily activities than were first-time prisoners Additionally, in both regions, people in lockdown reported feeling more hopeless than first-time prisoners Conclusion: Although Governments introducing lockdown policies do not intend to punish their citizens as courts do when sending convicted offenders to prison, such policies can have unintended adverse consequences Psychological parallels can be drawn between the two forms of confinement ?

This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the students activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students.

Large scale cooperation allows murmuring starlings to outmaneuver preying falcons$^2$, shoaling sardines to outsmart sea lions$^3$, and homo sapiens to outlive their Pleistocene peers$^4$. On the micron-scale, bacterial colonies show excellent resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely packed, mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the immune system, and resist antibiotics$^{5-14}$. Production of an artificial swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challenge $\\\\frac{\\\\;\\\\;}{\\\\;\\\\;}$ while an individual bacterium has an evolutionary-forged internal machinery to produce propulsion, until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical composition of their environment to directly fuel their drive$^{14-23}$. When crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally for a finite fuel supply, quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation. Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel and is driven solely by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that transforms light energy into propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective repulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration of the micro-swimmers.","output":"Cooperation in a fluid swarm of fuel-free micro-swimmers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with parents non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia and Peru.

Integration of the graphene with multi-walled carbon nanotubes enlarged the electroactive surface area of the electrode and implicitly enhanced the electrochemical response for DCF determination. On the basis of the sorption autocatalytic effect manifested at low concentration of DCF, we found that the preconcentration step applied prior to differential-pulsed voltammetry (DPV) and multiple-pulsed amperometry (MPA) allowed for the enhancement of the electroanalytical performance of the DCF electrochemical detections, which were validated by testing in tap water. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) of 1.40 ngL(?1) was found using preconcentration prior to DPV under optimized operating conditions, which is better than that reached by other carbon-based electrodes reported in the literature.","output":"Electrochemical Method for Ease Determination of Sodium Diclofenac Trace Levels in Water Using GrapheneMulti-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Paste Electrode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus led to the postponement, and possible cancellation, of the remainder of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2019-20 season Major League Baseball's (MLB) (2020 season) and the National Football League's (NFL) (2020-21) seasons may be cancelled too This empirical note estimates the loss of jock tax revenue to US states and the District of Columbia as a result of the potential cancellations of the remainder of the NBA and the entire MLB and NFL seasons, respectively It finds that US states (along with the District of Columbia) stand to lose a combined nearly US$307 million in jock tax collections if the MLB and NFL seasons are cancelled and the suspended NBA regular season games are not made up due to the COVID-19 crisis To our knowledge, this study provides the first state-by-state calculation of jock tax collections at the state/non-federal jurisdictional level","output":"COVID-19-related jock tax revenue losses in US states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite evidence concerning the widespread growth of K-12 blended teaching and the impact that emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the spread of K-12 online and blended teaching, we could find no systematic reviews focused on preparing K-12 teachers for blended teaching.

Pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 synthesis has been shown to suppress tumor initiation and growth in vivo. In the current study, we demonstrated that the growth of the Ptgs2-deficient the 3LL lung adenocarcinoma cell line was downregulated in vivo through natural killer (NK) cell activation and a reduction in the population of polymorphonuclear leukocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Based on these results, the therapeutic effect of ONO-AE3-208 (EP4i), an inhibitor of EP4 (a PGE2 receptor), combined with anti-PD-1Ab was evaluated. EP4i, but not anti-PD-1 Ab, decreased tumor metabolism including glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. EP4i induced IFN?3 production from only NK cells (not from T cells) and a shift from M2- to M1-like macrophages in TAMs. These effects were further enhanced by anti-PD-1 Ab treatment. Although CD8T cell infiltration was increased, IFN?3 production was not significantly altered, even with combination therapy. Tumor hypoxia was ameliorated by either EP4i or anti-PD-1 Ab treatment, which was further affected by the combination. Normalization of tumor vessels was significant only for the combination therapy. The results indicate a novel effect of EP4i for the metabolic reprogramming of tumors, revealed unique features of EP4i that can synergize with anti-PD-1Ab to promote IFN?3 production of NK cells, polarize TAMs into the M1-phenotype, and reduce hypoxia through normalization of the tumor vasculature.

Among them, back-shoring (i.e., relocation to the home country) and near-shoring (relocation to the home region) are two of the alternatives attracting growing interest from scholars. This paper aims to shed new light on the variables influencing the choice made between these two alternatives. As requested in the extant literature, a contingency approach is adopted, focusing attention on the footwear industry. Given the exploratory nature of the paper, evidence from 41 back-shoring and near-shoring strategies are analysed, comparing data from Spanish and Italian companies. Collected data are adapted to test hypotheses concerning three sets of variables: firms characteristics, motivations for the second degree relocation and its barriers. Collected data show that firms size directly influences the chosen alternative since larger companies prefer to near-shore instead of back-shore. When considering motivations, while the made in effect does not influence the firms choice, availability of skilled contractors and/or government aids induces companies to relocate to the home country instead of the home region. Finally, companies fearing encountering barriers, in terms of skilled contractors availability and/or (re-)development of internal manufacturing competences, will prefer the back-shoring rather than the near-shoring option. The study is focused on two countries (Spain and Italy) where the manufacturing sector (and the footwear industry within it) is still relevant to the local economy. Findings cannot be generalized to countries/industries where the local industry has been totally dismantled, without a previous in-depth analysis. The findings obtained offer managers useful insights on the elements that should be carefully evaluated when considering back- and near-shore alternatives. Additionally, valuable insights are provided for policy makers that plan to design industrial policies supporting back-reshoring policy initiatives.

With organ-specific or organ-limited and systemic ADs, physicians often are faced with a dilemma when making a diagnosis and may feel a kind of embarrassment when a more distinct nosological entity cannot be found. ADs often overlap with other diseases and good diagnostic procedures for ADs only become evidence-based when refined histopathologic, immunopathologic, and general laboratory analyses are available. Immunofluorescence analyses, Western blotting, CUT & RUN technology allow localization of the site of autoantibody-reactivity on the relevant DNA sequence.

The current use of mRNA as a vaccine against COVID-19 has increased confidence in the use of mRNA or long non-coding RNAs in the treatment strategy for ADs. The integration of new knowledge about innate immunity, the complement system, vaccinology, and senescence into the care of patients with ADs expands the therapeutic arsenal of disease-modifying drugs and allows for the repurposing of anti-cytokine monoclonal/biosimilar antibodies, originally designed for chronic inflammatory diseases, for ADs.

Methods: A single center retrospective chart review was conducted in all patients seen in endocrinology clinic for diabetes mellitus between 5/27/2020C7/20/2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical record. The primary research question is percentage of patients who achieved HbA1C  8% at 3 month follow up. Secondary research questions are characteristic of patients and clinic visits, diabetic technology usage, 3 month follow up mean HbA1c and HbA1c change. This project was approved by the institutional review boards. Results: Two hundred and six diabetic patients were seen: 72 (35%) in person, 49 (24%) phone visit, and 85 (41%) VDO visit. Mean age for patients adopted in person visit was 57 (SD 15) years, phone visit was 68 (SD 13) years and VDO visit was 54 (SD 18) years, p <0.001. Male percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 44%, 59% and 61% respectively, p 0.09. New consult visit percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 7%, 2% and 5% respectively, p 0.46. Percentage of patients using insulin pump or continuous glucose monitoring for in person, phone and VDO visit was 33%, 43% and 54%, respectively, p 0.03. Baseline HbA1c was done in 89% (64/72) in person, 45% (22/49) phone and 52% (44/85) VDO visit. Among patients who had baseline HbA1c, average HbA1c was 8.6% (SD 1.8) for in person visit, 8.0% (SD 1.1) for phone visit and 8.1% (SD 1.8) for VDO visit, p 0.25. At 3 months, HbA1c was done in 38% of patients who had in person visit, 36% phone visit, and 43% VDO visit.

Our objective was to compare mechanical ventilator weaning duration for critically ill adults and children when managed with automated systems versus non-automated strategies. Secondary objectives were to determine differences in duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events. METHODS Electronic databases were searched to 30 September 2013 without language restrictions. We also searched conference proceedings; trial registration websites; and article reference lists. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined data using random-effects modelling. RESULTS We identified 21 eligible trials totalling 1,676 participants. Pooled data from 16 trials indicated that automated systems reduced the geometric mean weaning duration by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 45%), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 87%, P <0.00001). Reduced weaning duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) and Smartcare/PS (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not with surgical populations or using other systems. Automated systems reduced ventilation duration with no heterogeneity (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There was no strong evidence of effect on mortality, hospital LOS, reintubation, self-extubation and non-invasive ventilation following extubation. Automated systems reduced prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Overall quality of evidence was high.

No difference was found in survival to discharge and discharge with favorable neurological status, with inconclusive results in TSA. In conclusion, pre-hospital use of mechanical CPR devices may benefit adult OHCA in achieving ROSC and survival to admission.

Among 758 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the province of Tucuman, Argentina, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5048 between antibodies elicited against the RBD and the nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Additionally, 33.6% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 displayed mild levels of RBD-IgG antibodies, while 19% of the patients showed high antibody titers. Interestingly, patients with SARS-COV-2 infection over 60 years old elicited significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies against RBD compared to younger ones, while no difference was found between women and men. Surprisingly, individuals from a high altitude village displayed statistically significant higher and longer lasting anti-RBD antibodies compared to those from a city at a lower altitude, suggesting that a hypobaric hypoxia-adapted mechanism may act as a protective factor for COVID-19.

We study the household consumption responses to Japans COVID-19 unconditional cash transfer program. Owing to frequent delays in local governments administrative procedures, the timing of the payment to households varied unexpectedly. Using this natural experiment, we analyze households consumption responses to cash transfers using high-frequency data from personal finance management software that links detailed information on expenditure, income, and wealth. We construct three consumption measures: one captures the baseline marginal propensity to consume (MPC), and the other two are for the lower and the upper bound of MPC. Additionally, we explore heterogeneity in MPCs by household income, wealth, and population characteristics, as well as consumption categories. Our results show that households exhibit immediate and non-negligible positive responses in household expenditure. There is significant heterogeneity depending on various household characteristics, with liquidity constraint status being the most crucial factor, in line with the standard consumption theory. Additionally, this study provides policymakers with insights regarding targeted cash transfer programs, conditioning on labor income, and liquidity constraints.","output":"Who spent their COVID-19 stimulus payment?

Hence, we sought to assess the association of permanent AF with in-hospital outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study including consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome for the study was defined as all cause in-hospital mortality. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AF were compared to patients without AF. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age of 55 years, 55.4% men) were enrolled. Of them 40 (11.4%) had AF. Patients with AF were older; were more likely to have co-morbidities, abnormal chest radiography findings and deteriorated laboratory parameters such as D-dimer, troponin, albumin, urea. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with AF compared to patients without AF (32.5% vs. 13.5%, log-rank p = 0.002, RR 2.40). The number of patients who needed intensive care unit (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.002) and invasive mechanical ventilation (35% vs 15.2%, p = 0.002) were also higher in the AF group. In addition, length of in-hospital stay was longer in patients with AF (median 8 vs. 7 days, p = 0.008). After adjustment for age and co-morbidities, multivariable analyses revealed that AF (HR: 2.426, 95% CI: 1.089C5.405, p = 0.032) was independently associated with in-hospital death.

The diversity of clinical characteristics and progress are reported in many countries as the duration of the pandemic is prolonged. We aimed to perform a novel systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on findings about correlations between clinical characteristics and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: We analyzed cases of COVID-19 in different countries by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science databases and Google Scholar, from the early stage of the outbreak to late March. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatment strategies were retrospectively reviewed for the analysis. (3) Results: Thirty-seven (n = 5196 participants) COVID-19-related studies were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Fever, cough and fatigue/myalgia were the most common symptoms of COVID-19, followed by some gastrointestinal symptoms which are also reported frequently. Laboratory markers of inflammation and infection including C-reactive protein (CRP) (65% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56-81%)) were elevated, while lymphocyte counts were decreased (63% (95% CI 47-78%)). Meta-analysis of treatment approaches indicated that three modalities of treatment were predominantly used in the majority of patients with a similar prevalence, including antiviral agents (79%), antibiotics (78%), and oxygen therapy (77%). Age was negatively correlated with number of lymphocytes, but positively correlated with dyspnea, number of white blood cells, neutrophils, and D-dimer. Chills had been proved to be positively correlated with chest tightness, lung abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) scans, neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelets count, D-dimer and CRP, cough was positively correlated with sputum production, and pulmonary abnormalities were positively correlated with CRP. White blood cell (WBC) count was also positively correlated with platelet counts, dyspnea, and neutrophil counts with the respective correlations of 0.668, 0.728, and 0.696.

DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members' experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19's effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members' feelings about the patient's diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: The stress and uncertainty of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were influenced by their inability to feel connected to the patient and informed about care.

We aimed to understand the incidence of and outcomes associated with new-onset AF in a diverse and representative US cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We used data from the American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry. Patients were stratified by the presence versus absence of new-onset AF. The primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure). The association of new-onset AF and the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated using Cox proportional-hazards models for the primary time to event analyses. RESULTS: Of the first 30 999 patients from 120 institutions across the United States hospitalized with COVID-19, 27 851 had no history of AF. One thousand five hundred seventeen (5.4%) developed new-onset AF during their index hospitalization. New-onset AF was associated with higher rates of death (45.2% versus 11.9%) and MACE (23.8% versus 6.5%). The unadjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.81-2.18) and for MACE was 2.23 (95% CI, 1.98-2.53) for patients with versus without new-onset AF. After adjusting for demographics, clinical comorbidities, and severity of disease, the associations with death (hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.99-1.23]) fully attenuated and MACE (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.14-1.50]) partially attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset AF was common (5.4%) among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Almost half of patients with new-onset AF died during their index hospitalization. After multivariable adjustment for comorbidities and disease severity, new-onset AF was not statistically significantly associated with death, suggesting that new-onset AF in these patients may primarily be a marker of other adverse clinical factors rather than an independent driver of mortality.

However, distributions of parasitic species have not been comprehensively compared in this context. We investigated which factors most influence the geographical extent of mammal parasites. Using the Global Mammal Parasite Database we analysed 17 818 individual geospatial records on 1806 parasite species (encompassing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, arthropods and helminths) that infect 396 carnivore, ungulate and primate host species. As a measure of the geographical extent of each parasite species we quantified the number and area of world ecoregions occupied by each. To evaluate the importance of variables influencing the summed area of ecoregions occupied by a parasite species, we used Bayesian network analysis of a subset ( n = 866) of the parasites in our database that had at least two host species and complete information on parasite traits. We found that parasites that covered more geographical area had a greater number of host species, higher average phylogenetic relatedness between host species and more sampling effort. Host and parasite taxonomic groups had weak and indirect effects on parasite ecoregion area; parasite transmission mode had virtually no effect. Mechanistically, a greater number of host species probably increases both the collective abundance and habitat breadth of hosts, providing more opportunities for a parasite to have an expansive range. Furthermore, even though mammals are one of the best-studied animal classes, the ecoregion area occupied by their parasites is strongly sensitive to sampling effort, implying mammal parasites are undersampled. Overall, our results support that parasite geographical extent is largely controlled by host characteristics, many of which are subsumed within host taxonomic identity.","output":"What factors explain the geographical range of mammalian parasites?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has recently emerged as an enteric pathogen that can cause serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. The first outbreak of PDCoV occurred in the United States in 2014 and was followed by reports of PDCoV in South Korea, China, Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam, leading to economic losses for pig farms and posing a considerable threat to the swine industry worldwide. Our previous studies have shown that PDCoV encodes three accessory proteins, NS6, NS7, and NS7a, but the functions of these proteins in viral replication, pathogenesis, and immune regulation remain unclear. Here, we found that ectopic expression of accessory protein NS6 significantly inhibits Sendai virus-induced interferon beta (IFN-) production as well as the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B. Interestingly, NS6 does not impede the IFN- promoter activation mediated via key molecules in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, specifically RIG-I, MDA5, and their downstream molecules MAVS, TBK1, IKK, and IRF3. Further analyses revealed that NS6 is not an RNA-binding protein; however, it interacts with RIG-I/MDA5. This interaction attenuates the binding of double-stranded RNA by RIG-I/MDA5, resulting in the reduction of RLR-mediated IFN- production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of NS6 antagonizes IFN- production by interfering with the binding of RIG-I/MDA5 to double-stranded RNA, revealing a new strategy employed by PDCoV accessory proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral immune response.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus accessory proteins are species specific, and they perform multiple functions in viral pathogenicity and immunity, such as acting as IFN antagonists and cell death inducers. Our previous studies have shown that PDCoV encodes three accessory proteins. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that PDCoV accessory protein NS6 antagonizes IFN- production by interacting with RIG-I and MDA5 to impede their association with double-stranded RNA. This is an efficient strategy of antagonizing type I IFN production by disrupting the binding of host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These findings deepen our understanding of the function of accessory protein NS6, and they may direct us toward novel therapeutic targets and lead to the development of more effective vaccines against PDCoV infection.","output":"Porcine Deltacoronavirus Accessory Protein NS6 Antagonizes Interferon Beta Production by Interfering with the Binding of RIG-I/MDA5 to Double-Stranded RNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 era exposes what was already a crisis in the medical profession: structural racism, ageism, sexism, classism, and ableism resulting in healthcare disparities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD).

In this commentary, we suggest that disability competency is insufficient because the healthcare disparities experienced by PWD are not simply a matter of individual biases, but structural and systemic factors requiring a culture shift in the healthcare professions. Recognizing that disability is a form of diversity that is experienced alongside other systemic disadvantages like social class, race, age, sex, gender identity, and geographic location, we explore the transformative potential of disability conscious medical education, training, and practice that draws on insights from intersectional disability justice activism. Disability conscious medicine is a novel approach, which improves upon competency programs by utilizing disability studies and the principles of disability justice to guide us in the critique of norms, traditions, and institutions to more fully promote the respect, beneficence, and justice that patients deserve.","output":"COVID-19 and the need for disability conscious medical education, training, and practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the toxic capsule crisis during April 2012 aroused widespread public concern about the risk of chromium-contaminated capsules and drug safety in China. In this article, we develop a conceptual model to investigate risk perceptions of the pharmaceutical drug capsules and behavioral responses to the toxic capsule crisis and the relationship between associated factors and these two variables. An online survey was conducted to test the model, including questions on the measures of perceived efficacy of the countermeasures, trust in the State FDA (Food and Drug Administration), trust in the pharmaceutical companies, trust in the pharmaceutical capsule producers, risk perception, concern, need for information, information seeking, and risk avoidance. In general, participants reported higher levels of risk perception, concern, and risk avoidance, and lower levels of trust in the three different stakeholders. The results from the structural equation modeling procedure suggest that perceived efficacy of the countermeasures is a predictor of each of the three trust variables; however, only trust in the State FDA has a dampening impact on risk perception. Both risk perception and information seeking are significant determinants of risk avoidance. Risk perception is also positively related to concern. Information seeking is positively related to both concern and need for information. The theoretical and policy implications are also discussed.","output":"An empirical study of the toxic capsule crisis in China: risk perceptions and behavioral responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to efficiently suppress the induction of antiviral type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) in non-lymphatic cells through inhibition of the transcription factor IRF-3. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, in contrast, respond to infection with production of high levels of IFNs. Here, we show that pretreatment of non-lymphatic cells with small amounts of IFN-alpha (IFN priming) partially overturns the block in IFN induction imposed by SARS-CoV. IFN priming combined with SARS-CoV infection substantially induced genes for IFN induction, IFN signalling, antiviral effector proteins, ubiquitination and ISGylation, antigen presentation and other cytokines and chemokines, whereas each individual treatment had no major effect. Curiously, however, despite this typical IFN response, neither IRF-3 nor IRF-7 was transported to the nucleus as a sign of activation. Taken together, our results suggest that (i) IFN, as it is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, could enable tissue cells to launch a host response to SARS-CoV, (ii) IRF-3 and IRF-7 may be active at subdetectable levels, and (iii) SARS-CoV does not activate IRF-7.","output":"Interferon priming enables cells to partially overturn the SARS coronavirus-induced block in innate immune activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the newly emergent causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide since it was first detected in 2019. There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidina de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPson SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate. Highlights Brilacidin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in an ACE2 positive human lung cell line. Brilacidin achieved a high Selectivity Index of 426 (CC50=241M/IC50=0.565M). Brilacidins main mechanism appears to disrupt viral integrity and impact viral entry. Brilacidin and remdesivir exhibit excellent synergistic activity against SARS-CoV-2. Significance Statement SARS-CoV-2, the emergent novel coronavirus, has led to the current global COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by extreme contagiousness and high mortality rates. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that brilacidin, a synthetic small molecule with peptide-like properties, is capable of exerting potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Brilacidin, a COVID-19 Drug Candidate, Exhibits Potent In Vitro Antiviral Activity Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic. The spatial variation in the environmental, health, socioeconomic, and demographic risk factors of COVID-19 death rate is not well understood. Global models and local linear models were used to estimate the impact of risk factors of the COVID-19, but these do not account for the nonlinear relationships between the risk factors and the COVID-19 death rate at various geographical locations. We proposed a local nonlinear nonparametric regression model named geographically weighted random forest (GW-RF) to estimate the nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 death rate and 47 risk factors derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Information, Centers for Disease Control and the US census. The COVID-19 data were employed to a global regression model random forest (RF) and a local model GW-RF. The adjusted R2 of the RF is 0.69. The adjusted R2 of the proposed GW-RF is 0.78. The result of GW-RF showed that the risk factors (i.e. going to work by walking, airborne benzene concentration, householder with a mortgage, unemployment, airborne PM2.5 concentration and per cent of the black or African American) have a high correlation with the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 death rate, and these key factors driven from the GW-RF were mapped, which could provide useful implications for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Distribution of the environmental and socioeconomic risk factors on COVID-19 death rate across continental USA: a spatial nonlinear analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Bayesian persuasion model studies communication between an informed sender and a receiver with a payoff-relevant action, emphasizing the ability of a sender to extract maximal surplus from his informational advantage.

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS: A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","output":"The immediate impact of lockdown measures on mental health and couples' relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic - results of a representative population survey in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and objective: Vaccinations are the safest and for many years proven way of acquiring immunity.

Existing FL protocol designs have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks that aim to compromise data privacy and/or model robustness. Recently proposed defenses focused on ensuring either privacy or robustness, but not both. In this paper, we develop a framework called PRECAD, which simultaneously achieves differential privacy (DP) and enhances robustness against model poisoning attacks with the help of cryptography. Using secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques (e.g., secret sharing), noise is added to the model updates by the honest-but-curious server(s) (instead of each client) without revealing clients' inputs, which achieves the benefit of centralized DP in terms of providing a better privacy-utility tradeoff than local DP based solutions. Meanwhile, a crypto-aided secure validation protocol is designed to verify that the contribution of model update from each client is bounded without leaking privacy. We show analytically that the noise added to ensure DP also provides enhanced robustness against malicious model submissions. We experimentally demonstrate that our PRECAD framework achieves higher privacy-utility tradeoff and enhances robustness for the trained models.","output":"PRECAD: Privacy-Preserving and Robust Federated Learning via Crypto-Aided Differential Privacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has disproportionately impacted older adults, highlighting the need to address social isolation for this population. Homebound older adults are at risk for loneliness, which is a correlate of poor mental and physical health.

In-depth empirical validation of loneliness scales is needed to examine the measurement of this construct for homebound older adults who are aging in place. This study examined the reliability and validity of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (v3) for a community-dwelling population of older adults who received home-based support services due to their homebound status or have chronic illness resulting in ADL limitations.

A total of 99 cases of primary endometrial carcinoma were investigated for survivin expression by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the association between concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression, and clinicopathological parameters was examined. Immunopositivity for survivin was identified in 88% of cases. Concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression (staining scores and intensity) was observed in 60% of endometrial adenocarcinomas. A significant association was identified between the sum of staining intensity and scores of survivin immunopositive cells, and patient age (P=0.028), histological grade (P<0.001), clinical stage (P=0.018) and fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.039). A negative tendency for correlation was observed between surivin and PTEN immunostaining scores (P=0.062; =-0.238). Specimens with high scores of survivin expression tended to show decreased scores of PTEN immunostaining, and vice versa. However, in circumstances with an increased co-expression of survivin and PTEN, a statistically significant association with histological types was observed (P=0.020). A statistically significant positive correlation was identified between survivin and p53 sum co-expression (P=0.008; =0.300). Furthermore, a significant association was identified between survivin and p53 concomitant sum expression and age of patients (P=0.001), histological type (P=0.020), clinical stage (P=0.037), histological differentiation (P=0.001) and presence of fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.026).

Increased expression levels of survivin and PTEN may serve a role in the development of more aggressive endometrial carcinoma during their interaction. In addition, protein expression levels of survivin and p53 are positively correlated and may share a common molecular pathway to promote endometrial carcinogenesis.

Power production during flight follows a U-shaped curve in relation to speed in bats yet, in contrast to birds, bats use mostly exogenous nutrients for sustained flight. The navigation capacity of most bats is dominated by the echolocation system, yet other sensory modalities, including an iron-based magnetic sense, may contribute to navigation depending on a bat's familiarity with the terrain. Patterns derived from these capacities relate to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions with food items. The navigation capacity of bats may influence their sociality, in particular, the extent of group foraging based on eavesdropping on conspecifics' echolocation calls.

METHODS Our AI instrument noninvasively examines and grades aneurysms in both arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous grafts. Aneurysm stages were adjudicated by 3 vascular specialists, based on a grading system that focuses on actions that need to be taken. Our automatic classification of aneurysms builds on 2 components: (a) the use of smartphone technology to capture aneurysm appearance and (b) the analysis of these images using a cloud-based convolutional neural network (CNN).

Health care workers caring for patients with potentially infectious health conditions are using PPE for long periods of time. However, long-term use of PPE can cause many physiological health hazards among health care workers. So, the current study was carried out to assess the general health problems and dermatological problems experienced by health care workers with PPE use. Materials and methods A descriptive cross-sectional survey has been carried out in two selected tertiary care hospitals in central India by recruiting 301 health care workers. Non-probability convenient sampling technique was used to select participants for the study. Sociodemographic Performa and structured questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic characteristics of the participants and various health problems experienced by health care workers with PPE use. Collected data were analyzed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The current study reported excessive sweating (86.4%), difficulty in reading (85%), dry mouth (80.7%), and breathing difficulty (74.1%) as the most common problem associated with PPE use. In addition to this, adverse reactions like headache, restlessness, and dizziness were reported by 70.1%, 64.5%, and 50.8%. Indentation and pain on the back of the ears (76.1%), skin soaking (67.1%), and excessive sweating (76.1%) were identified as the most common problems related to N-95 masks, gloves, and coverall use. Conclusion The current study revealed a higher incidence of various health problems with PPE use among health care workers. The findings of the study highlight the importance of developing various guidelines to reduce the negative impact of PPE use and implementing preventive measures to decrease health problems associated with PPE use.","output":"Physiological Hazard Assessment While Wielding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Among Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on invasive mechanical ventilation were found to have high rates of barotrauma Herein, we present five patients admitted to the intensive care unit between March and April 2020, who developed barotrauma as a complication of COVID-19 pneumonia This series includes four males and one female with a mean age of 54 years, most without significant chronic comorbidities or former tobacco use All were intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to the COVID-19 infection The diagnosis of barotrauma was confirmed via radiography showing the presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema on radiographic imaging At the time, they were evaluated for convalescent plasma infusion, remdesivir, and interleukin-6 inhibitor Each of the five patient's hospital courses were documented The average number of days between intubation and subsequent barotrauma was 6 8 days with the mean length of hospital stay being 49 days Three of the five patients passed away due to complications related to COVID-19 Due to the unknown nature of the virus, our findings add to the growing evidence that those infected, even without significant comorbidities, are at high risk for pulmonary complications and in-hospital mortality","output":"Barotrauma Linked to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection in Younger Patients: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, analysis of litter-based binary endpoints (e.g., incidence of malformed fetuses) is complex in that littermates often are not entirely independent of one another. It is well established that the litter, not the individual fetus, is the proper independent experimental unit in statistical analysis. Accordingly, analysis is often based on the proportion affected per litter and the litter proportions are analyzed as continuous data. Because these proportional data generally do not meet assumptions of symmetry or normality, data are typically analyzed by nonparametric methods, arcsine square root transformation, or logit transformation. METHODS We conducted power calculations to compare different approaches (nonparametric, arcsine square root-transformed, logit-transformed, untransformed) for analyzing litter-based proportional data. A reproductive toxicity study with a control and one treated group provided data for two endpoints: prenatal loss, and fertility by in utero insemination (IUI). Type 1 error and power were estimated by 10,000 simulations based on two-sample one-tailed t tests with varying numbers of litters per group. To further compare the different approaches, we conducted additional analyses with shifted mean proportions to produce illustrative scenarios. RESULTS Analyses based on logit-transformed proportions had greater power than those based on untransformed or arcsine square root-transformed proportions, or nonparametric procedures. CONCLUSION The logit transformation is preferred to the other approaches considered when making inferences concerning litter-based proportional endpoints, particularly with skewed distributions. The improved performance of the logit transformation becomes increasingly pronounced as the response proportions are increasingly close to the boundaries of the parameter space.","output":"Analysis of proportional data in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies: Comparison of sensitivities of logit transformation, arcsine square root transformation, and nonparametric analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The ratio of end-tidal-to-arterial carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2/PaCO2) was recently suggested for monitoring pulmonary gas exchange in subjects with COVID-19 associated ARDS. Yet, no evidence was offered supporting that claim. Therefore, we evaluated whether PETCO2/PaCO2 might be relevant in assessing ARDS not associated with COVID-19. METHODS We evaluated the correspondence between PETCO2/PaCO2 and VD/VT measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom PETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to four categories representing increasing severity of PETCO2/PaCO2 (0.80, 0.61 to 0.79, 0.50-0.59 and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson Spearman tests, group comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact test. Overall mortality risk was assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS PETCO2/PaCO2 correlated strongly with VD/VT (R = -0.87 [-0.89, -0.85] P < 0.001). Decreasing PETCO2/PaCO2 was associated with increased VD/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis for every 0.01 decrease in PETCO2/PaCO2 mortality risk increased by 1% (OR: 0.009 [0.003-0.029] P < 0.001), and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables: 0.19 (0.04-0.91) P = 0.039. PETCO2/PaCO2 < 0.50 was characterized both by very high VD/VT (0.82  0.05, P < 0.001) and hospital mortality (70%).

One mechanism is molecular mimicry, where a foreign antigen shares sequence or structural similarities with self-antigens. Molecular mimicry has typically been characterized on an antibody or T cell level. However, structural relatedness between pathogen and self does not account for T cell activation in a number of autoimmune diseases. A proposed mechanism that could have been misinterpreted for molecular mimicry is the expression of dual T cell receptors (TCR) on a single T cell. These T cells have dual reactivity to both foreign and self-antigens leaving the host vulnerable to foreign insults capable of triggering an autoimmune response. In this review, we briefly discuss what is known about molecular mimicry followed by a discussion of the current understanding of dual TCRs. Finally, we discuss three mechanisms, including molecular mimicry, dual TCRs, and chimeric TCRs, by which dual reactivity of the T cell may play a role in autoimmune diseases.","output":"Molecular Mimicry as a Mechanism of Autoimmune Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies are the basis of almost all approved prophylactic vaccines and the foundation of effective protection from pathogens, including the recently emerging SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We analyzed the antibodies and B cell responses in severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Despite our primary assumption that high antibody titers contribute to a mild disease, we found that severe COVID-19 illness, and not mild infection, correlates with strong anti-viral antibody and memory B cell responses. This phenomenon was also demonstrated for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibiting antibodies that we recently isolated from an actively infected Tuberculosis-sick donor. This correlation between disease severity and antibody responses can be explained by the fact that high viral loads drive B cell stimulation and generation of high-affinity antibodies that will be protective upon future encounter with the particular pathogen.","output":"Antibodies: what makes us stronger."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The devastating effects of death due to Covid-19 on the bereaved are not adequately addressed.

The major components of the RIG-I- and TLR pathways have putatively been identified, but previously unrecognised kinases may contribute to virus infection-induced activation of the IFN response. Here, we screened a human kinase cDNA library, termed the kinome, using an IFN-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay in HEK293 cells during Sendai virus infection. Of the 568 kinases analysed, nearly 50 enhanced IFN-1 gene expression at least twofold in response to Sendai virus infection. The best activators were FYN (FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES), serine/threonine kinase 24, activin A receptor type 1 and SRPK1 (SFRS protein kinase 1). These kinases enhanced RIG-I-dependent IFN-1 promoter activation via IFN-stimulated response and NF-B elements, as confirmed using mutant IFN-1 promoter constructs. FYN and SRPK1 enhanced IFN-1 and CXCL10 protein production via the RIG-I pathway, and stimulated RIG-I and MyD88-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, respectively. We conclude that several previously unrecognised kinases, particularly FYN and SRPK1, positively regulate IFN-1 and similarly regulated cytokine and chemokine genes during viral infection.","output":"Human kinome analysis reveals novel kinases contributing to virus infection and retinoic-acid inducible gene I-induced type I and type III IFN gene expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Characterization of the clinical features of patients with persistent symptoms after mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and exploration of factors associated with the development of Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome (CCS).

Participants: 42 patients who presented with persistent moderate to severe fatigue six months following a mostly mild SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Charite Fatigue Center from July to November 2020. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were clinical and paraclinical data and meeting diagnostic criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant neurological and cardiopulmonary morbidity was excluded. Results: The median age was 36.5, range 22-62, 29 patients were female and 13 male. At six months post acute COVID-19 all patients had fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Score median 25 of 33, range 14-32), the most frequent other symptoms were post exertional malaise (n=41), cognitive symptoms (n=40), headache (n=38), and muscle pain (n=35). Most patients were moderately to severely impaired in daily live with a median Bell disability score of 50 (range 15-90) of 100 (healthy) and Short Form 36 (SF36) physical function score of 63 (range 15-80) of 100. 19 of 42 patients fulfilled the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

We aimed to include 10 EDs for countries with greater than 20 million inhabitants and 5 EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was less than 5. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20 and 21 to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyze data. Results: Overall, 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events.

METHODOLOGY We reviewed a single-centre cohort of children referred for a suspicion of neuroinflammatory disorder between January 2015 and March 2021. Age, date, sex, diagnosis, MOG-IgG antibodies status and detected pathogens at presentation were identified. Comparative statistical analysis was performed based on diagnosis between years and seasons using Pearson's Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables, as appropriate. We compared the post-lockdown period (March 17th, 2020, to March 31st, 2021) to previous calendar years (2015 to 2019) alone and to previous calendar years and the pre-lockdown 2020 period (January 1st, 2020, to March 16th, 2020). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between the post-lockdown period and previous years were performed on significant results. A false discovery rate adjustment with an adjusted p-value (q-value) < 0.05 was computed. We hypothesized that the number of new MOGAD would be significantly lower in the post-lockdown period compared to previous years due to decreased regional pathogen transmission. RESULTS Among 491 referred cases, we identified 415 new cases of neuroinflammatory disorder between January 2015 and March 2021. The number of new neuroinflammatory disorder diagnoses did not change between years. We noted significantly fewer new MOGAD diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years, with no MOGAD patients presenting in 2020 after the spring lockdown (q=0.0009). In addition, there were significantly fewer parainfectious neuroinflammatory cases (q=0.04) and pathogen detected (q=0.04) in the post-lockdown period.

SETTING: Admissions for COVID-19 from UK hospitals; data on symptoms, severity, access to interventions, complications, mortality and length of stay were extracted. INTERVENTIONS: Non-invasive respiratory support, intubation, tracheostomy, ventilation and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: Subjective presenting symptoms such as loss of taste/smell were less frequently reported in ID patients, whereas indicators of more severe disease such as altered consciousness and seizures were more common. Controls had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, asthma, rheumatological disorder and smoking. ID patients were admitted with higher respiratory rates (median=22, range=10C48) and were more likely to require oxygen therapy (35.1% vs 28.9%). Despite this, ID patients were 37% (95% CI 13% to 57%) less likely to receive non-invasive respiratory support, 40% (95% CI 7% to 63%) less likely to receive intubation and 50% (95% CI 30% to 66%) less likely to be admitted to the ICU while in hospital.

There were no statistically significant differences in regards to end-of-life care preferences apart from being involved in treatment decisions, between adult and older adult groups. CONCLUSION: There was only one difference between the end-of-life preferences of the adult group versus the older adult group in regards to the topic of patient involvement in treatment decisions. Furthermore, receiving the full truth regarding their illness, being free from distressing symptoms, having loved ones around, and living with a sense of meaning were important end-of-life care preferences for both groups. Therefore, these should be taken into account when developing strategies towards improving patient life quality during their end-of-life period.","output":"General population-based study on preferences towards end-of-life care in Southern Thailand: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze tracheostomies after intubation for SARS-Cov-2 infection performed by otorhinolaryngologists in 7 university hospitals in the Paris area of France during the month March 24 to April 23, 2020.

The main goals were to evaluate the number, characteristics and practical conditions of tracheostomies, and the Covid-19 status of the otorhinolaryngologists. Secondary goals were to analyze tracheostomy time, decannulation rate, immediate postoperative complications and laryngotracheal axis status. Results: Tracheostomy indications were for ventilatory weaning and extubation failure in 86% and 14% of cases respectively. The technique was surgical, percutaneous or hybrid in 91.5%, 3.4% and 5.1% of cases respectively. None of the operators developed symptoms consistent with Covid-19. Postoperative complications occurred in 15% of cases, with no significant difference between surgical and percutaneous/hybrid techniques (p=0.33), although no complications occurred after percutaneous or hybrid tracheostomies. No procedures or complications resulted in death. The decannulation rate was 74.5% with a mean tracheostomy time of 2012 days. In 55% of the patients evaluated by flexible endoscopy after decannulation, a laryngeal abnormality was found. On univariate analysis, no clinical features had a significant influence on tracheostomy time, decannulation rate or occurrence of laryngeal lesions.

The variable clinical course of SARS may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent. Therefore, the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV is imperative in building as complete an immunological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness. Here we review recent advances in SARS immunopathogenesis research and present a summary of our findings regarding host responses in SARS patients.

This reactivation is orchestrated by the interplay of sleep slow oscillations, spindles, and theta, which are in turn modulated by certain neurotransmitters like GABA to enable long-lasting plastic changes in the memory store. Here we asked whether the GABAergic system and associated changes in sleep oscillations are functionally related to memory reactivation during sleep. We administered the GABAA agonist zolpidem (10 mg) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. To specifically focus on the effects on memory reactivation during sleep, we experimentally induced such reactivations by targeted memory reactivation (TMR) with learning-associated reminder cues presented during post-learning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Zolpidem significantly enhanced memory performance with TMR during sleep compared with placebo. Zolpidem also increased the coupling of fast spindles and theta to slow oscillations, although overall the power of slow spindles and theta was reduced compared with placebo. In an uncorrected exploratory analysis, memory performance was associated with slow spindle responses to TMR in the zolpidem condition, whereas it was associated with fast spindle responses in placebo. These findings provide tentative first evidence that GABAergic activity may be functionally implicated in memory reactivation processes during sleep, possibly via its effects on slow oscillations, spindles and theta as well as their interplay.","output":"The effect of zolpidem on targeted memory reactivation during sleep."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are the most challenging and feared obstacles in resuming these surgical procedures.

With the huge advancements of technology, the medical data has increased dramatically, and therefore, there is a need to apply data mining and machine learning methods to extract new knowledge from this data. Several classification methods were used to analyze medical data sets and diagnostic problems, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In addition, to improve the performance of classification, feature selection methods have been extensively used in many fields. This paper aims to propose a comprehensive approach to enhance the prediction of PD using several machine learning methods with different feature selection methods such as filter-based and wrapper-based.

A total of 372 tissues or serum samples collected from pigs distributed in 9 provinces/municipalities of China during the period from February 2011 to November 2012 were assayed for T. gondii antigens and antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, while the PCR was designed for the detection of the PRRSV, CSFV and PCV-2, respectively. The total positive rate of T. gondii, PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 9.14% (34/372), 50.00% (186/372), 37.10% (138/372) and 3.23% (12/372), respectively. Among the 34 T. gondii positive samples, 26 samples were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and viruses, while the remaining eight samples were infected with T. gondii alone. In addition, the co-infection rate of T. gondii with PRSSV, T. gondii with PRSSV and CSFV, T. gondii with PRSSV and PCV-2, T. gondii with CSFV and PCV-2, T. gondii with PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 1.61% (6/372), 4.03% (15/372), 0.27% (1/372), 0.27% (1/372) and 0.81% (3/372), respectively.

Thus, the only feasible solution for prevention relies on the detection of COVID-19-positive cases through quick and accurate testing. Since artificial intelligence (AI) offers the powerful mechanism to automatically extract the tissue features and characterise the disease, we therefore hypothesise that AI-based strategies can provide quick detection and classification, especially for radiological computed tomography (CT) lung scans. METHODOLOGY: Six models, two traditional machine learning (ML)-based (k-NN and RF), two transfer learning (TL)-based (VGG19 and InceptionV3), and the last two were our custom-designed deep learning (DL) models (CNN and iCNN), were developed for classification between COVID pneumonia (CoP) and non-COVID pneumonia (NCoP). K10 cross-validation (90% training: 10% testing) protocol on an Italian cohort of 100 CoP and 30 NCoP patients was used for performance evaluation and bispectrum analysis for CT lung characterisation. RESULTS: Using K10 protocol, our results showed the accuracy in the order of DL > TL > ML, ranging the six accuracies for k-NN, RF, VGG19, IV3, CNN, iCNN as 74.58  2.44%, 96.84  2.6, 94.84  2.85%, 99.53  0.75%, 99.53  1.05%, and 99.69  0.66%, respectively.

Our Bispectrum-based characterisation system suggested CoP can be separated against NCoP using AI models. COVID risk severity stratification also showed a high correlation of 0.7270 (p < 0.0001) with clinical scores such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), further validating our AI models. CONCLUSIONS: We prove our hypothesis by demonstrating that all the six AI models successfully classified CoP against NCoP due to the strong presence of contrasting features such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, and pleural effusion in CoP patients.

A total of 10,634 patients with 16,194 hypertension visits were present in our national telemedicine practice database during this time period. Among this population, a total of 569 patients who had 1,785 hypertension visits met the criteria of having two or more blood pressure readings, with the last blood pressure reading occurring in the report period. We analyzed baseline characteristics and blood pressure trends of these 569 patients over the study period. Voluntarily submitted patient satisfaction ratings, which were systematically requested at the end of each visit, were also analyzed. Results The mean age of the patients in this study cohort of 569 patients was 43.9 years, and 48.3% were women. Over 62% of the patients had an initial systolic BP over140 mm Hg, and 25% had an initial SBP of greater than 160 mm Hg. The average number of visits over the study period was 3.1 visits per patient. An average of 6.4 BP measurements per patient were available over the study period. Over the study period, 77% of the patients experienced an improvement in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure, with mean reductions of -9.7 mm Hg and -6.8 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. A total of 416 patients in the cohort started with a blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg. For this subset of patients, 55.7% achieved a BP of <=140/90 by the end of the study period, and the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were -17.9 mm Hg and -12.8 mm Hg respectively, which corresponded to improvements of 11.2% and 12.4% respectively. These improvements did not vary significantly when patients were stratified by age, sex, or geographic region of residence (rural versus urban/suburban).

Here, we use targeted transcriptomics of FFPE tissue using the Nanostring GeoMX? platform to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19, pandemic H1N1 influenza and uninfected control patients. Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls.

We describe a rapidly implemented COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The 'COVID-adapted pathway' integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting 'high-risk' symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as 'urgent suspicious of cancer'. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019 (3.3%).

P. physalis are sometimes present in large swarms, and with tentacles capable of intense stings, they can negatively impact public health and commercial fisheries. P. physalis, which does not swim, is advected by ocean currents and winds acting on its gas-filled sail. While previous studies have attempted to model the drift of P. physalis, little is known about its sources, distribution, and the timing of its arrival to shore. In this study, we present a dataset with four years of daily P. physalis beachings and stings reports at three locations off Sydney's coast in Australia. We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of P. physalis presence (beachings and stings) in relation to different environmental parameters. This dataset shows a clear seasonal pattern where more P. physalis beachings occur in the Austral summer and less in winter. Cold ocean temperatures do not hinder the presence of P. physalis and the temperature seasonal cycle and that observed in P. physalis presence/absence time-series are out of phase by 3-4 months. We identify wind direction as the major driver of the temporal variability of P. physalis arrival to the shore, both at daily and seasonal time-scales. The differences observed between sites of the occurrence of beaching events is consistent with the geomorphology of the coastline which influences the frequency and direction of favorable wind conditions. We also show that rip currents, a physical mechanism occurring at the scale of the beach, can be a predictor of beaching events. This study is a first step towards understanding the dynamics of P. physalis transport and ultimately being able to predict its arrival to the coast and mitigating the number of people who experience painful stings and require medical help.","output":"Driving the blue fleet: Temporal variability and drivers behind bluebottle (Physalia physalis) beachings off Sydney, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-enabled e-healthcare can complement traditional medical treatments in a flexible and convenient manner. However, security and privacy become the main concerns of IoMT due to the limited computational capability, memory space and energy constraint of medical sensors, leading to the in-feasibility for conventional cryptographic approaches, which are often computationally-complicated. In contrast to cryptographic approaches, friendly jamming (Fri-jam) schemes will not cause extra computing cost to medical sensors, thereby becoming potential countermeasures to ensure security of IoMT. In this paper, we present a study on using Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. We first analyze the data security in IoMT and discuss the challenges. We then propose using Fri-jam schemes to protect the confidential medical data of patients collected by medical sensors from being eavesdropped. We also discuss the integration of Fri-jam schemes with various communication technologies, including beamforming, Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) and full duplexity. Moreover, we present two case studies of Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. The results of these two case studies indicate that the Fri-jam method will significantly decrease the eavesdropping risk while leading to no significant influence on legitimate transmission.","output":"Securing Internet of Medical Things with Friendly-jamming schemes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ayurvedic medicines are widely employed globally for prophylaxis and treatment of a variety of diseases. Coronil is a tri-herbal medicine, constituted with the traditional herbs, Tinospora cordifolia, Withania somnifera and Ocimum sanctum, with known immunomodulatory activities. Based on its proven in-vitro activity and in-vivo efficacy, Coronil has been approved as a 'Supporting Measure for COVID-19' by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. The current study was aimed to assess the non-clinical safety of Coronil in a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study along with a 14-day recovery period in Sprague Dawley rats. This toxicity study was conducted in accordance with OECD test guideline 407, under GLP-compliance. Specific-Pathogen-Free animals of either sex, housed in Individually-Ventilated-Cages were particularly used in the study. The tested Coronil dose levels were 0, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, orally administered to 5 males and 5 female rats per test group. In the current study, no mortality was observed in any group and in addition, Coronil did not elicit any finding of toxicological relevance with respect to clinical signs, ocular effects, hematology, urinalysis and clinical chemistry parameters, as well as macro- or microscopical changes in any organs, when compared to the control group. Accordingly, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) of Coronil was ascertained to be 1000 mg/kg/day, subsequent to its 28-day oral administration to male and female rats. The acceptable safety profile of Coronil paves the way further toxicity assessments in rodents for a longer duration as well as in higher animals, and towards its clinical investigation.","output":"28-day repeated dose toxicological evaluation of Coronil in Sprague Dawley rats: Behavioral, hematological, biochemical and histopathological assessments under GLP compliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, more and more news readers tend to read news online where they have access to millions of news articles from multiple sources.

Introduction: In Tunisia, as elsewhere in the world, severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-Covid19 have been observed. When the usual means of resuscitation were no longer sufficient, the implementation of the Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO was needed. Aim: The whole problem of the management of these patients in this pandemic period has been to manage the operation of the ECMO machine, usually reserved for expert and specialized centers in the field. Methods: The cardio-vascular surgery department of La Rabta teaching hospital of Tunis has tried the experience of management of ECMO implanted in the different reanimations of Tunis, remotely, using telemedicine and social networks. Thus, a Facebook-Messenger discussion group was created and enabled the management of patients under ECMO via video conferencing in real time involving all stakeholders. Results: A call was made whenever the physician needed it. The video provided an opportunity to discuss with surgeons and perfusionists in real time the complications or problems of these patients. Their clinical status was continuously shared on the focus group. Following the instructions of the expert surgeons and the exchanges made on the group, the reanimator could then intervene on this or that parameter. Conclusion: Social media have invaded everyones daily lives and health professionals are not exception to this trend. The Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened this digital alternative with the goal of efficiency and patient interest. While their use in a professional setting offers many advantages, it must nevertheless be done in compliance with the rules of ethics and bring real added value.","output":"La tlmdecine et des rseaux sociaux dans la gestion des ECMO  lre de COVID-19 : lexprience Tunisienne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article offers reflections based on the special issue on unsettling entrepreneurship education (EEP 3(3)) in which contributions have resisted the tendency to see students as consumers with the ?right? to take part in entrepreneurship education (EE) so as to effectively shape their enterprising selves Here we resume our editorial discussions of what unsettling entrepreneurship education could mean for us ? as entrepreneurship researchers and as teachers ? and seek to mark out new directions both for research and education by reflecting upon ethical perspectives, identity work, and how EE can be seen to create an affective and emotional workspace These aspects not only invite us to ask new research questions, but may also challenge our position as teachers in EE and invite us to reflect upon our view of students To frame the need of continuous reflection, when navigating the terrain of EE in neoliberal society, we both take off and arrive in the current Covid-19 pandemic and suggest that this crisis can teach us something as valuable as ?standing still?, which helps us all to reconsider what kind of entrepreneurial society that we build together with our students in entrepreneurship education","output":"Navigating the Terrain of Entrepreneurship Education in Neoliberal Societies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Empirical studies show that epidemiological models based on an epidemics initial spread rate often fail to predict the true scale of that epidemic. Most epidemics with a rapid early rise die out before affecting a significant fraction of the population, whereas the early pace of some pandemics is rather modest. Recent models suggest that this could be due to the heterogeneity of the target populations susceptibility. We study a computer malware ecosystem exhibiting spread mechanisms resembling those of biological systems while offering details unavailable for human epidemics. Rather than comparing models, we directly estimate reach from a new and vastly more complete data from a parallel domain, that offers superior details and insight as concerns biological outbreaks. We find a highly heterogeneous distribution of computer susceptibilities, with nearly all outbreaks initially over-affecting the tail of the distribution, then collapsing quickly once this tail is depleted. This mechanism restricts the correlation between an epidemics initial growth rate and its total reach, thus preventing the majority of epidemics, including initially fast-growing outbreaks, from reaching a macroscopic fraction of the population. The few pervasive malwares distinguish themselves early on via the following key trait: they avoid infecting the tail, while preferentially targeting computers unaffected by typical malware.","output":"Initial growth rates of malware epidemics fail to predict their reach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of addictive use of social media (AUSM) with depressive symptoms, perceived social support and demographic variables among people aged 65 years and older. METHODS People aged 65 years and older who use social media constituted the study sample. The data were obtained from social networking sites via Google survey link. Bergen social media addiction scale (BSMAS) for determining AUSM, Multidimensional Scale of Social Support for determining social support, Geriatric Depression Scale to identify depressive symptoms and sociodemographic data form were administered to the participants. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 68.86  2.0 years. AUSM showed significant differences depending on gender, marital status, economic status, educational level, settlement, occupation, and time spent in social media (P = 0.00). AUSM had correlations with both sub-dimensions of perceived social support and depressive symptoms (P < 0.01). In the regression analysis, it was found that the depressive symptoms, social support from family (P = 0.00) and from a significant other (P = 0.001) had significant effects on AUSM. CONCLUSIONS When evaluating elderly individuals with depressive symptoms, it is important to evaluate these individuals in terms of social media addiction.

METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational case series involved review of medical records of all patients presenting to the glaucoma service during the COVID-19 lockdown period and comparison with the previous year (March 23 to June 23, 2020 Vs 2019) in a tertiary center in India. RESULTS: We found a 78.9% reduction in overall outpatient visits (54,345 vs. 257,339; P < 0.001) and 80.9% reduction in the number of glaucoma outpatient visits (4,788 vs. 25,083; P < 0.001). Additionally, the proportion of true glaucoma emergency visits significantly increased by 62.4% in 2020 Vs 2019 (1,408/4,788 (29.4%) vs. 4,542/25,083 (18.1%); P < 0.001). Lens-induced glaucomas were the most common glaucoma surgical emergency (13.4%) in 2020. Moreover, comparison of procedures demonstrated a proportionate decrease in incisional glaucoma surgeries (70/115 (60.86%) vs. 806/939 (85.83%); P < 0.001) and an increase in the proportion of emergency cataract surgeries (129/475 (27.15%) vs. 170/2715 (6.26%); P < 0.001) and transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (45/115 (39.13%) vs. 133/939 (14.16%); P = 0.0001) during 2020 vs. 2019.

We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Twenty-nine patient files were investigated in group 1 and group 2 was created with 52 consecutive patients with COVID-19 having age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, and disease course. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of inhospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in the group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay, and transferred to intensive care unit were found to be statistically significantly higher in the group 1.

Methods Four focus groups with twelve web-based mental health professionals from the service Kooth were conducted on Zoom, and data analysed using thematic analysis. Participatory workshops with young people with diverse experiences supplemented the study approach and design and involved young people in the co-design of the focus group topic guide and the interpretation and validation of analysis. Results Four main themes and additional sub-themes were identified relating to the experiences of vulnerable young people on a web-based mental health platform. These were Escalation of risk , The Experience and Consequence of Loss , Feeling Supported and Empowered , and Feeling Separate and Isolated . Conclusions Findings broadly reflect early data that suggests that those with existing vulnerability face increased risk of poor outcomes through the pandemic and the restrictions of lockdown, but evidence is also provided of positive outcomes from lockdown and its function as a catalyst for change.

Background: Previous research in laparoscopy and robotic teleoperation found that complex perceptual-motor adaptations associated with misaligned viewpoints corresponded to degraded performance in manipulation. Because optimal camera positioning is often unavailable in restricted environments, alternative viewpoints that might mitigate performance effects are not obvious. Methods: A virtual keyboard-controlled targeting task was remotely distributed to workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment was performed by 192 subjects for a static viewpoint with independent parameters of target direction, Fitts' law index of difficulty, viewpoint azimuthal angle (AA), and viewpoint polar angle (PA). A dynamic viewpoint experiment was also performed by 112 subjects in which the viewpoint AA changed after every trial. Results: AA and target direction had significant effects on performance for the static viewpoint experiment. Movement time and travel distance increased while AA increased until there was a discrete improvement in performance for 180{\\\\deg}. Increasing AA from 225{\\\\deg} to 315{\\\\deg} linearly decreased movement time and distance. There were significant main effects of current AA and magnitude of transition for the dynamic viewpoint experiment. Orthogonal direction and no-change viewpoint transitions least affected performance. Conclusions: Viewpoint selection should aim to minimize associated rotations within the manipulation plane when performing targeting tasks whether implementing a static or dynamic viewing solution. Because PA rotations had negligible performance effects, PA adjustments may extend the space of viable viewpoints. Applications: These results can inform viewpoint-selection for visual feedback during psychomotor tasks.","output":"Manually Acquiring Targets from Multiple Viewpoints Using Video Feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. METHODS: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. RESULTS: The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit? (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79%  65%) to 79% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsultas usage. The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings.","output":"Teleconsultation Between Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Catalan Primary Care Service: Message Annotation Analysis in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper seeks to determine which workers affected by lockdown measures can return to work when a government decides to apply lockdown exit strategies.

This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the worlds most affected countries, and its health system was already experiencing the aftermath of the 2015 recession. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (S?o Paulo) and impoverished (Maranh?o) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. RESULTS: We found the concept of health sector crisis to be politically charged among healthcare providers in S?o Paulo and Maranh?o. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexibleCif insecureCworking arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies have streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but were also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranh?o.

It carries benefits like reduced stress and expense of traveling, maintenance of social distancing, and reduced risk of infection. There are some potential drawbacks such as lack of physical examination, liability and technological issues. Methods A questionnaire was sent to 200 patients, selected from different virtual clinics (new and review, doctor and ANP led) run between March and May 2020 in the rheumatology department of University Hospital Waterford. We formulated 14 questions to cover the following aspects: demography, the purpose of the consult, punctuality, feedback, medico-legal concerns, and free text for comments.

In Rhode Island, there have been 170,000 cases and 2,820 deaths. Investigating resource utilization and waste production during disease outbreaks can inform efforts at disaster preparedness. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in waste production during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a descriptive study examining trends in waste production during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted at a suburban community hospital in Rhode Island. Data was collected on regulated medical waste (RMW) and linen use from October 2019-July 2021. Adjusted patient days (APD) values were calculated using hospital census and revenue data. Total weight and weight/APD were calculated for each month of the study period. Data was then compared with overall COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Rhode Island. This data was gathered from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) COVID Response Data Hub. RESULTS: Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) by total weight was lowest in April 2020, when the hospital census and adjusted patient days (APD) were at their lowest. In contrast, linen use remained largely consistent with pre-pandemic levels during the initial months of the pandemic despite a decrease in hospital census. The highest linen weight/APD value (23.32 lbs/APD) was in April 2020. Both RMW and linen use (weight/APD) decreased during the study period. Linen use was highest during months with increased COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined trends in waste production at a community hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Linen use was highest during months of increased COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, while RMW production decreased.

The highest average 10 min concentrations were observed at home and in bedrooms, while the participants were using specific products typically used in Africa, Asia, and South America that included insecticides (IST; 999 g/m(3)) and incense (ICS; 145 g/m(3)), followed by traffic (216 g/m(3)) and cooking (150 g/m(3)). The lowest average 10 min concentrations were also observed in the same microenvironment lacking IST or ICS (14 g/m(3)). With no use of specific products, office workers and students were the least exposed, and drivers and cooks were the most exposed. The concentrations are up to 7.5 and 3 times higher than the World Health Organizations yearly and daily recommended exposure levels, respectively, indicating the need to promptly elaborate and apply effective mitigation strategies to improve air quality and protect public health. This study highlights the importance of indoor air pollution sources related to culture and confirms previous studies on urban outdoor air pollution sources, especially in developing countries. The findings could be applied to cities other than Bamako, as similar practices and lifestyles are common in different cultures.","output":"Personal Exposure to Fine Particles (PM(2.5)) in Northwest Africa: Case of the Urban City of Bamako in Mali"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The China American Psychoanalytic Alliance (CAPA) has been offering psychoanalytic psychotherapy training and treatment to Chinese mental health professionals entirely over the Internet since 2006. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, most practitioners worldwide had to turn to teletherapy. US psychoanalytic practitioners were more negative towards teletherapy than those from other theoretical orientations. We predicted that CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners would be more prepared for teletherapy services during the pandemic, since they their training and treatment had been on-line. METHOD: We compared survey results from 164 CAPA practitioners with 165 US psychoanalytic practitioners (matched for age) who had recently psychoanalytically treated a patient on-line. CAPA participants were recruited from CAPA email lists and the US sample were recruited from the Society for Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychology of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association and International Psychotherapy Institute. RESULTS: CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners had more positive opinions about teletherapy before the pandemic; had more positive opinions about teletherapy during the pandemic; and had more positive opinions about the effectiveness of teletherapy in working with transference, relational issues and resistance. The CAPA practitioners were more prepared to do psychoanalytic psychotherapy during the pandemic than the US psychoanalytic practitioners.

As a result, novel therapeutic agents to improve radiosensitivity are urgently needed. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Ibr-7 (a derivative of ibrutinib) on the radiosensitivity of human pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: The effect of Ibr-7 on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assays. Radiosensitivity was assessed by clonogenic formation assays. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analysed by flow cytometry. DNA damage was evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis. The expression levels of PARP, Cleaved caspase 3, p-EGFR and EGFR were determined by western blot. RESULTS: Ibr-7 showed an anti-proliferative effect on PANC-1 and Capan2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ibr-7 (2 mol/L) enhanced the effect of radiation on PANC-1 and Capan2 cells. Further findings showed that this combination enhanced G2/M phase arrest and increased cell apoptosis. Additional molecular mechanism studies revealed that the expression of p-EGFR was decreased by Ibr-7 alone or in combination with radiation. Overexpression of p-EGFR reversed the cell apoptosis induced by Ibr-7 combined with radiation. Moreover, the expression of -H2AX was significantly decreased in the Ibr-7 plus radiation group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated the potential application of Ibr-7 as a highly effective radiosensitizer for the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells.","output":"The Ibr-7 derivative of ibrutinib radiosensitizes pancreatic cancer cells by downregulating p-EGFR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines have long played a crucial role in the prevention, mitigation and eradication of infectious diseases More than any other recent outbreak, the COVID-1","output":"The COVID-19 Vaccine Race: Intellectual Property, Collaboration(s), Nationalism and Misinformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION As the laparoscopic approach has become a popular gastric cancer treatment in Korea and Japan, the need for sharing current practices of surgeons who are experienced in laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery has increased. METHODS We sent a questionnaire on laparoscopic instruments, image documentation, preoperative evaluation, surgical indication, operative methods, and postoperative management to laparoscopic experts in Korea and Japan, and 24 (14 from Korea and 10 from Japan) responded. RESULTS Endoscopic ultrasound and preoperative endoscopy-guided clipping are routinely employed, respectively, by 14 (58%) and 20 (83%) of the surgeons. Surgeons perform laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) based on varying indications. Five surgeons (21%) performed LADG only for cases of stage T1 cancer, 15 (63%) performed LADG on patients with less than T2 lesions, and 4 (17%) performed LADG on patients with less than T3 lesions. With regard to postoperative anastomosis, 18 surgeons (75%) preferred extracorporeal anastomosis and 6 (25%) preferred intracorporeal anastomosis. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.5 days in Korea and 10.1 days in Japan (P < 0.001).

However, studies continue to investigate the most effective and safe drug therapies to manage the various stages of viral infection. It is critical in the therapeutic management of the patient, with ongoing COVID-19 infection, to reduce viral load and replication, and to regulate the generalized hyperinflammatory state caused by the cytokine storm that occurs in the most severe phases. Probably the right drug therapy is represented by the use of different drugs acting in different modalities and on different targets, to avoid also viral drug resistance. In this article, we describe an interesting scientific pharmacological hypothesis arising from the evidence in the literature; we believe that the association of baricitinib/remdesivir/rhACE2, administered at the right time and dose, represents an important pharmacological synergism that can be therapeutically more effective for the treatment of COVID-19 infection than the single administration of drugs and avoid the phenomenon of drug resistance caused by the virus.","output":"Association and pharmacological synergism of the triple drug therapy baricitinib/remdesivir/rhACE2 for the management of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives of this project were to (1) evaluate environmental and air quality parameters across different types of calf housing facilities; (2) evaluate rates of respiratory illness in preweaned calves; and (3) determine the impact of environmental factors, air quality, and housing type on calf health. This was an observational study in which calf facilities were evaluated on a single visit during June 2015. Housing included hutches (n = 9), individual pens in a barn (n = 11), and group pens in a barn (n = 9). Facility and calf pen evaluations included wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, heat stress index, bedding type, bedding composite sample for bacteria counts, nesting score of calf pens, calf health scoring, and airborne bacteria. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 to determine the impact of housing type, environmental, and air quality variables on calf respiratory score. A total of 29 facilities and 437 preweaned calves were evaluated. Calf facility temperature averaged 24.2C (range 15.5 to 30.6C) with a relative humidity of 21.5% (range 10 to 78%) and a heat index of 21.5C (range 6 to 30.9C). Temperature and airborne bacterial counts were greater in hutches as compared with individual and group pens (P < 0.01). Humidity was similar for hutches and group pens, but greater than individual pens. Gram negative airborne bacterial counts were lowest in individual pens. No difference in heat index was observed across housing type. Mean calf respiratory scores was 2.5 (range of 0 to 9) on a 12 point scale; 13.33% of calves evaluated scored greater than 5, indicating a respiratory challenge. Prevalence of respiratory illness in preweaned calves ranged from 0 to 50% of calves on a per farm basis (mean = 11.05% of calves/farm), with 44.82% of farms having no respiratory illness and 10.32% of farms having 30 to 50% of evaluated calves exhibiting signs of respiratory illness. There was a negative correlation between respiratory score and pen temperature (R(2) = 0.90). There was no influence on respiratory score by housing system, bedding type, ventilation system, relative humidity, airflow, or airborne bacterial counts. Data collected from this study suggests that respiratory illness continues to be a challenge, even when weather is temperate.

We sought to analyze the magnitude of misinformation that is being spread on Twitter (Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, CA) regarding the coronavirus epidemic. Materials and methods We conducted a search on Twitter using 14 different trending hashtags and keywords related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We then summarized and assessed individual tweets for misinformation in comparison to verified and peer-reviewed resources. Descriptive statistics were used to compare terms and hashtags, and to identify individual tweets and account characteristics. Results The study included 673 tweets. Most tweets were posted by informal individuals/groups (66%), and 129 (19.2%) belonged to verified Twitter accounts. The majority of included tweets contained serious content (91.2%); 548 tweets (81.4%) included genuine information pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic. Around 70% of the tweets tackled medical/public health information, while the others were pertaining to sociopolitical and financial factors. In total, 153 tweets (24.8%) included misinformation, and 107 (17.4%) included unverifiable information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. The rate of misinformation was higher among informal individual/group accounts (33.8%, p: <0.001). Tweets from unverified Twitter accounts contained more misinformation (31.0% vs 12.6% for verified accounts, p: <0.001). Tweets from healthcare/public health accounts had the lowest rate of unverifiable information (12.3%, p: 0.04).

For this reason, the volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and Dubai crude daily oil price data between 29 May 2006 and 31 March 2020 are analysed. Firstly, the presence of chaotic and nonlinear behaviour in the oil prices during the pandemic and the concurrent conflict is investigated by using the Shanon Entropy and Lyapunov exponent tests. The tests show that the oil prices exhibit chaotic behavior. Additionally, the current paper proposes a new hybrid modelling technique derived from the LSTARGARCH (Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model and LSTM (long-short term memory) method to analyse the volatility of oil prices. In the proposed LSTARGARCHLSTM method, GARCH modelling is applied to the crude oil prices in two regimes, where regime transitions are governed with an LSTAR-type smooth transition in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance. Separating the data into two regimes allows the efficient LSTM forecaster to adapt to and exploit the different statistical characteristics and ARCH and GARCH effects in each of the two regimes and yield better prediction performance over the case of its application to all the data. A comparison of our proposed method with the GARCH and LSTARGARCH methods for crude oil price data reveals that our proposed method achieves improved forecasting performance over the others in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) in the face of the chaotic structure of oil prices.","output":"Analyzing crude oil prices under the impact of COVID-19 by using lstargarchlstm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marginalized populations are being disproportionally affected by the current pandemic. Direct effects include higher infection rates with greater morbidity and mortality; indirect effects stem from the societal response to limit the spread of the virus. These same groups also have smoking rates that are significantly higher than the general population. In this commentary, we discuss how the pandemic has been acting to further increase the harm from tobacco endured by these groups by applying the syndemic framework. Using this approach, we elaborate on the factors that promote clustering of harms from tobacco with harms from COVID-19. These include the worsening of psychological distress, a potential increase in smoking behaviour, greater exposure to second-hand smoke and less access to smoking cessation services. Then, we offer mitigation strategies to protect disadvantaged groups from tobacco-related harm during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies include affordable smoking cessation services, a proactive approach for smoking treatment using information technology, opportunistic screening and treatment of tobacco dependence among individuals presenting for COVID-19 vaccination, policy interventions for universal coverage of cessation pharmacotherapy, comprehensive smoke-free policies and regulation of tobacco retail density. Now more than ever, coordinated action between clinicians, health care systems, public health organizations and health policy makers is needed to protect vulnerable groups from the harm of tobacco.","output":"Protecting vulnerable groups from tobacco-related harm during and following the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers the response of the Korean church to the crisis of COVID-19, giving a theological reflection on worship, church, and mission Through the various challenges and responses, the Korean church has come to rethink each of these topics Though a gathering worship is still important, how to worship is more essential than where to worship Church as God?s people is more important than church as its building or as its hierarchical structure And in mission, wherever is more essential than whereto These insights can contribute significantly to a deeper understanding of worship, church, and mission for these times","output":"The Korean Churchs Reflection on Worship, Church, and Mission in the Calamity of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory infection is the major cause of disease and death in children, particularly in developing countries. However, the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria that exist in many of these countries remains incompletely characterized. The aim of this study was to examine the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria associated with acute respiratory infection in children under the age of 16. METHODS: A total of 10 435 serum sera specimens were collected from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect immunoglobulin M antibodies against nine common pathogens: mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila, coxiella burnetii and chamydophila pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 10 435 specimens examined, 7046 tested positive for at least one pathogen. Among all of the tested pathogens, mycoplasma pneumonia had the highest detection rate (56.9%). Influenza virus A and influenza virus B epidemics occurred during both winter and summer. The detection rate of respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus was higher in spring. Cases of mixed infection were more complex: 4136 specimens (39.6%) tested positive for 2 pathogens. There were statistically significant difference in detection rates of mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila and chamydophila pneumonia among different age groups (P < 0.05).

However, outcomes vary among patients who present in advanced clinical stages of disease. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether racial disparity exists at initial presentation and response to intervention. METHODS A retrospective database was created to include all radiofrequency ablation procedures performed by a single surgeon from January 14, 2009, through May 25, 2011. Demographics, clinical traits, race, procedure, and outcomes were analyzed. Stepwise model selection reduced candidate baseline factors to a final parsimonious model, which was analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS The database consisted of 300 patients with a predominant female (n = 215, 85%) base and 85 (15%) males, with a mean age distribution of 53 years. The mean body mass index was 30.2. Racial distribution revealed Asian (n = 9, 3.3%), Pacific Islander (n = 1, 0.4%), African American (n = 37, 13.6%), and Caucasian (CAU, n = 225, 82.7%).

Of the 42 participants surveyed, approximately half indicated that COVID-19 changed their motivation and ability to quit or remain quit. Among those who reported that it was easier to quit following the stay-at-home orders (n = 24), most attributed this to concerns regarding the severity of COVID-19 among smokers. Among those who reported more difficulty quitting (n = 15), most attributed this to their increased stress due to the pandemic and the inability to access activities, places, or people that could help them manage triggers.

The neurocutaneous flap depends on the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and its retrograde-flow has been studied via cadaveric dissection. The aim of this study is to prove the vascularity of the lateral antebrachial neurocutaneous (LABN) flap. METHODS The distally based LABN flap was created in 18 upper limbs (12 cadavers). The skin flap was dissected at the proximal half of the forearm and then diluted methylene blue was injected through the brachial artery. The pedicle of the flap on the distal half of the forearm was dissected along the LACN for the anatomical study of the perforating branches, paraneural vessels, and flap territory. RESULTS The mean age of cadavers was 74.1 years (nine males). The mean distance of most distal and proximal perforating branches from the radial styloid process were 2.32  0.59 and 11.17  1.72 cm, respectively. The mean total number of perforating branches was 7.4, which abundantly appeared approximately 4 to 5 cm from the radial styloid process. The mean flap territory was 8.64  0.82 cm in width and 10.50  1.90 cm in length. The mean forearm circumference was 24.84  1.52 cm, and mean forearm length was 24.74  1.8 cm. CONCLUSION This study ensured that retrograde-flow via the neurocutaneous artery could be provided through the vascularity of the LABN flap, which suggests that the pivot point of the flap should not extend beyond 5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process.

METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to 18 October 2021: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Forward and backwards citation searches were also undertaken. All relevant literature were included. RESULTS: After de-deduplication, 3,629 records remained. 3,416 were excluded at the title/abstract screening stage. A further 111 were excluded at full-text screening stage. In total, 102 unique studies were included. Results showed that risk-stratified bowel screening programmes can potentially improve diagnostic performance, but there is a lack of information on longer-term outcomes. Risk models do appear to show promise in refining existing risk stratification guidelines but most were not externally validated and less than half achieved good discriminatory power. Risk assessment tools in primary care have the potential for high levels of acceptability and uptake, and therefore, could form an important component of future risk-stratified bowel screening programmes, but sometimes the screening recommendations were not adhered to by the patient or healthcare provider. The review identified important knowledge gaps, most notably in the area of organisation of screening services due to few pilots, and what risk stratification might mean for inequalities. CONCLUSION: We recommend that future research focuses on what organisational challenges risk-stratified bowel screening may face and a consideration of inequalities in any changes to organised bowel screening programmes.

In 2019, a total of 12 million adults reported serious thoughts of suicide during the past year, 3.5 million planned a suicide, and 1.4 million attempted suicide (2).

Investigating patients acceptance of moving towards remote consultations in the long-term is essential to guide future service development.ObjectivesTo evaluate satisfaction with telephone and video consultations of Paediatric allergy outpatients and their carers during COVID-19 and thus the feasibility of using telemedicine in this department beyond the pandemic. Additionally, the paper identifies categories of patients for whom face-to-face contact should be maintained.MethodsThis was a prospective data collection involving telephone surveys as the primary source of data. Participants were asked about their experience with remote consultations and their preference when compared with face-to-face consultations. The data was collected in a tertiary level Paediatric allergy department in central London from April to August 2020.ResultsFifty questionnaires were completed, of which 80% were follow-up clinics. Ninety percent were phone consultations while the remaining were video-calls. The overall quality and experience was rated highly (4.5/5), specifically on clear explanations and follow-up discussion (4.8/5). Half of those interviewed felt a remote consultation was adequate;47% patients were brought in for additional testing. Highlighted issues specific to remote consultations included poor audio quality (10%), problems with video (2%), and concerns over others listening in (2%). General issues included not confirming the patients identity (6%) or asking who else was present (52%). The majority of parents said they would have remote consultations in the future (70% sometimes, 12% always).The benefits of remote consultations were themed mostly around convenience, with no travel, no time off school/work, and no waste of time/money often being quoted. Participants also suggested that the majority of GPs were happy to prescribe medicines following the appointment. Conversely, the reasons against remote consultations were varied. The single common theme was the need for the patient and doctor to see each other. Reasons for this included non-verbal communication, perceived improved diagnosis in dermatological conditions, and a more personable consultation.ConclusionsThe data from this study suggests that most parents and patients found that telemedicine was more efficient and convenient and would be happy to have remote consultations in future. However, many expressed a preference for video over phone calls and a few did not want remote clinics again. Therefore, whilst online clinics are indeed viable after COVID-19, the option of face to face and remote could be offered to patients. Face to face may be more appropriate for patients with skin stigmata of diseases, especially where video has poor resolution, and in those patients experiencing a clinical deterioration. Furthermore, additional quality checks should be in place for telephone consultations such as ensuring that the patient (not only the carer) is present. Finally, the results of this study were promising yet this data may not be applicable for other paediatric specialities, and further research should be pursued.","output":"Patients experience of telemedicine in paediatric allergy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia using qualitative and/or quantitative chest computed tomography (CT) indicators and identify the CT characteristics of critical cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n = 12), severe cases (group B, n = 15), and critical cases (group C, n = 24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A (69% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these 3 groups with high sensitivity (B + C vs A, 90%; C vs B, 92%), specificity (100%, 87%), and accuracy (92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score (>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation (>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density (>-779 HU) and full width at half maximum (>128 HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density (a?|50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, 8 patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and 2 of them had died.

Our aim was to determine if sex or adipose tissue depot differences exist in response to CL. Daily CL injections were administered to diet-induced obese male and female mice for two weeks, creating four groups: male control, male CL, female control, and female CL. These groups were compared to determine the main and interaction effects of sex (S), CL treatment (T), and WAT depot (D). Glucose tolerance, body composition, and energy intake and expenditure were assessed, along with perigonadal (PGAT) and subcutaneous (SQAT) WAT gene and protein expression. CL consistently improved glucose tolerance and body composition. Female PGAT had greater protein expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), while SQAT (S, p < 0.001) was more responsive to CL in increasing UCP1 (ST, p = 0.011) and the mitochondrial biogenesis induction protein, PPAR coactivator 1 (PGC1) (ST, p = 0.026). Females also displayed greater mitochondrial OXPHOS (S, p < 0.05) and adiponectin protein content (S, p < 0.05). On the other hand, male SQAT was more responsive to CL in increasing protein levels of PGC1 (ST, p = 0.046) and adiponectin (S, p < 0.05).

One limitation to the evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate disease is the lack of susceptible small animals in large numbers. Commercially available laboratory strains of mice are not readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of species-specific differences in their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Here, we transduced replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 via intranasal administration into BALB/c mice and established receptor expression in lung tissues. hACE2-transduced mice were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, lung pathology, and weight loss. Passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated inflammation and weight loss. The development of an accessible mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis will expedite the testing and deployment of therapeutics and vaccines.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 infection model in mice demonstrates protection by neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the frontline of the pandemic stand healthcare workers and public service providers, occupations which have proven to be associated with increased mental health problems during pandemic crises. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected data from 1773 healthcare workers and public service providers throughout Norway between March 31, 2020 and April 7, 2020, which encompasses a timeframe where all non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) were held constant. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression were assessed by the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), General Anxiety Disorder C7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Health anxiety and specific predictors were assessed with specific items. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictor analysis. A total of 28.9% of the sample had clinical or subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and 21.2% and 20.5% were above the established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. Those working directly in contrast to indirectly with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher PTSD symptoms. Worries about job and economy, negative metacognitions, burnout, health anxiety and emotional support were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, after controlling for demographic variables and psychological symptoms. Health workers and public service providers are experiencing high levels of PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health workers working directly with COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression compared to those working indirectly. Appropriate action to monitor and reduce PTSD, anxiety, and depression among these groups of individuals working in the frontline of pandemic with crucial societal roles should be taken immediately.","output":"PTSD symptoms among health workers and public service providers during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The E.coli outbreak in Romania and the crisis of the babies' illness in Romania has evolved between February 4 and April 12, 2016.

Starting from these data, this paper aims to examine how the instructional risk messages are communicated to the large public by the Romanian online media outlets. Using the IDEA Model for effective instructional risk and crisis messages (Sellnow et al., 2012) and the Exemplification theory (Zillmann, 1999), this research presents a content analysis of online news articles published by 48 media outlets. The findings showed that the most used IDEA element is Explanation(E), constructed by emphasizing scientific information combined with the presence of the national institutions and experts. This element was used together with the element of Internalization(I), constructed by the emphasis of proximity and personal relevance for the publics. Three main themes could be highlighted: (1). the quest for the disease source;(2). the personal relevance of the epidemic;(3). the effective measures associated with the actions/statements of national experts.","output":"E.coli Outbreak, Romania and Crisis Communication: A Case Study on the Br?det Dairy Products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a model to show that when innovation in a given field becomes more lucrative, its direction can be distorted even though its rate rises.

We prospectively evaluated all Chilean patients on PD (48 centres) and followed those who had Covid-19 from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Chile (March 2020) to January 2021 (start of vaccination campaign). We described demographic history, comorbidities, factors related to infection, need for hospitalisation and death due to Covid-19. During the study period, 106 adults on PD were infected by SARS-CoV-2, with a mean age of 53.1 (16.3) and of which 53.9% were female. From that group, 54.8% required hospitalisation and 24.5% (n = 26) died due to Covid-19. Most of the patients (63.4%) were infected at home and 22.8% during hospitalisation for other reasons. There was a significant association for Covid-19 mortality with: being 60 years old, diabetes, time on PD 5 years, need for hospitalisation and hospital-acquired infection. At 90 days of follow-up, all deaths associated to Covid-19 occurred before 40 days. We conclude that patients on PD without Covid-19 vaccination have a high mortality and need for hospitalisation associated to Covid-19.

The online survey was administered to collect data for this research and the survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.SE in technology use had a significant but negative influence on learning engagement and had a positive impact on SE in an online learning environment. SE in time management had a significant positive impact on SE in an online learning environment and learning engagement. SE in an online learning environment also significantly influenced learning engagement.SE in technology use itself did not enhance learning engagement. In addition, indirect effects of SE in technology use and SE in time management on learning engagement through SE in an online learning environment were confirmed in this study. This indicates the influential role of SE in an online learning environment on learning engagement of online learners.

METHODS: For 5 weeks, we carried out a cross-sectional study consisting of telephone interviews of SLE patients. We collected epidemiological data, symptoms suggesting COVID-19, results of nasopharyngeal swabs, and ongoing treatments. In those patients who required hospital admission, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features, and outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Four hundred patients with SLE completed the survey. Overall, 4 (1.00%, 95%CI 0.02-1.98) patients were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26 (6.51%, 95%CI 4.08-8.94) as possible clinical cases. The incidence of confirmed cases in our series was similar to that of the Catalan population (1.00% versus 0.63%; p = 0.456), whereas the incidence of possible cases was higher in our series (6.51% versus 1.29%; p < 0.005). The only difference between SLE patients with confirmed and possible COVID-19 and those without was the percentage of patients who have had contact with a confirmed or possible case of COVID-19 (26.7% versus 9.2%; p = 0.003) CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients with inactive disease is low and, in our series, all cases with confirmed infection recovered.

Insight into the phylodynamics and mutation variants of this virus is vital to understanding the nature of its spread in different climate conditions. The incidence rate of COVID-19 is increasing at an alarming pace within subtropical South-East Asian nations with high temperatures and humidity. To understand this spread, we analysed 444 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available on the GISAID platform from six South-East Asian countries. Multiple sequence alignments and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed to analyse and characterize the non-synonymous (NS) mutant variants circulating in this region. Global mutation distribution analysis showed that the majority of the mutations found in this region are also prevalent in Europe and North America, and the concurrent presence of these mutations at a high frequency in other countries indicates possible transmission routes. Unique spike protein and non-structural protein mutations were observed circulating within confined area of a given country. We divided the circulating viral strains into four major groups and three subgroups on the basis of the most frequent NS mutations. Strains with a unique set of four co-evolving mutations were found to be circulating at a high frequency within India, specifically. Group 2 strains characterized by two co-evolving NS mutants which alter in RdRp (P323L) and spike (S) protein (D614G) were found to be common in Europe and North America. These European and North American variants have rapidly emerged as dominant strains within South-East Asia, increasing from a 0% prevalence in January to an 81% by May 2020.

The present study investigates the academic achievement of all incoming fifth-graders in the federal state of Baden-Wrttemberg before and during the pandemic, using educational large-scale assessment results in reading and mathematics. Each year, the assessments took place at the beginning of the school year in September (each n > 84,000). The comparison of average competence levels in 2021 with pre-pandemic years (2017C2019) indicates that the downward trend that was observed after the first pandemic wave in 2020 came to a halt in the domain of reading and continued at a slower rate in the domain of mathematical operations. Achievements in the mathematical domain of numbers even rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Longer periods of school closures were associated with larger learning losses. Additional analyses showed larger learning losses for the group of low-achieving students and for schools with less socio-cultural capital. The partial rebound of learning outcomes suggests that most teachers and students successfully adapted to the pandemic situation in 2021. Still, disadvantaged student groups are at high risk of further substantial learning losses due to school closures that may negatively affect their future education. Accordingly, disadvantaged student groups in particular should receive additional support to compensate for the loss of learning opportunities in the classroom.

Methods: We reviewed the demographics, comorbidities, timing of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients who received tracheostomies. Early tracheostomy was considered <14 days of ventilation. Medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated and compared with Wilcoxon rank sum, Spearman correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, and regression modeling. Results: From March 2020 to January 2021, our center had 370 patients intubated for SARS-CoV-2, and 59 (16%) had percutaneous bedside tracheostomy. Median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 19 (IQR 17 - 24) days. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between early and late tracheostomy, but early tracheostomy was associated with shorter ICU LOS and a trend towards shorter ventilation. To date, 34 (58%) of patients have been decannulated, 17 (29%) before hospital discharge; median time to decannulation was 24 (IQR 19-38) days.

METHODS: Single-institution retrospective chart review of patients with gynecologic cancer who participated in in-person and telemedicine visits (video and telephone) from January 2019 to November 2020. Patient characteristics, visit and treatment characteristics were collected. Comparisons between 2019 and 2020 and between in-person and telemedicine visits were performed. Cancer-specific visit details were described. RESULTS: From January to November 2020, 2,039 patients attended 5240 ambulatory visits in our gynecologic oncology outpatient clinics with 4,304 (82.1%) in-person visits, 512 (9.8%) video telemedicine visits, and 424 (8.1%) telephone visits. In 2020, 936 (45.9%) patients participated in a telemedicine visit. Demographic characteristics did not differ between those who participated in any telemedicine versus in-person visits (p > 0.05). Black patients represented a larger share of telephone visits but this was not significant. Patients aged > 65 years were more likely to use the telephone for a visit and less likely to use video visits compared to their younger counterparts. The majority of patients who attended a telemedicine visit also attended a visit in-person (88.0%). The most common purpose of the telemedicine visits was to discuss results and/or treatment plans (46%) with other appointments occurring for treatment check-ins and clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The use of telemedicine drastically increased in 2020. Patient demographics were not different between in-person and telemedicine visits except that older patients were more likely to use telephone visits over video visits.

Data were collected by self-report administered questionnaires using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for psychological distress, Perceived Threat Scale for perception, and Behavioral Response Inquiry for the behavioral response. Moreover, bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions analysis was used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables at p-value <0.05. Results: A total of 417 (98.6%) HCWs responded to a self-administered questionnaire. The proportion of HCWs who had moderate to severe symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic were 58, 16.3, 30.7, and 15.9%, respectively. Three-fifth of the nurses, medical laboratory professionals (62.2%), and physicians (59.2%) had reported good behavioral responses toward the COVID-19 pandemic. More than three-fifths of the nurses had reported poor perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, 61.2% of physicians and three-fourths (75.5%) of medical laboratory professionals had reported good perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Female and married participants, those working in the emergency unit, those with poor behavioral responses, and those with poor perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly associated with symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Conclusions: Psychological impacts among physicians, nurses, and medical laboratory professionals are high during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should aim to protect all HCWs' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate interventions and accurate information response.","output":"Psychological Distress, Early Behavioral Response, and Perception Toward the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health Care Workers in North Shoa Zone, Oromiya Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nasal bridge is a common site suffering personal protective equipment-induced skin damages over face among first-line health care workers in this coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

While there is a critical shortage of essential health workers in low- and middle-income countries, WHO and international partners have reached a consensus on the need to expand and strengthen CHW programmes as a key element in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The COVID-19 pandemic has further revealed that emerging health challenges require quick local responses such as those utilizing CHWs. This is the second paper of our 11-paper supplement, Community health workers at the dawn of a new era. Our objective here is to highlight questions, challenges, and strategies for stakeholders to consider while planning the introduction, expansion, or strengthening of a large-scale CHW programme and the complex array of coordination and partnerships that need to be considered. METHODS: The authors draw on the outcomes of discussions during key consultations with various government leaders and experts from across policy, implementation, research, and development organizations in which the authors have engaged in the past decade. These include global consultations on CHWs and global forums on human resources for health (HRH) conferences between 2010 and 2014 (Montreux, Bangkok, Recife, Washington DC). They also build on the authors direct involvement with the Global Health Workforce Alliance. RESULTS: Weak health systems, poor planning, lack of coordination, and failed partnerships have produced lacklustre CHW programmes in countries. This paper highlights the three issues that are generally agreed as being critical to the long-term effectiveness of national CHW programmesplanning, coordination, and partnerships. Mechanisms are available in many countries such as the UHC2030 (formerly International Health Partnership), country coordinating mechanisms (CCMs), and those focusing on the health workforce such as the national Human Resources for Health Observatory and the Country Coordination and Facilitation (CCF) initiatives introduced by the Global Health Workforce Alliance. CONCLUSION: It is imperative to integrate CHW initiatives into formal health systems. Multidimensional interventions and multisectoral partnerships are required to holistically address the challenges at national and local levels, thereby ensuring synergy among the actions of partners and stakeholders. In order to establish robust and institutionalized processes, coordination is required to provide a workable platform and conducive environment, engaging all partners and stakeholders to yield tangible results.","output":"Community health workers at the dawn of a new era: 2.

This is a highly professional job that involves many parts, such as identifying personal information, collecting related evidence, and making a final insurance report. Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the previous offline insurance assessment has to be conducted online. However, for the junior assessor often lacking practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such a complex online procedure, yet this is important as the insurance company needs to decide how much compensation the claimant should receive based on the assessor's feedback. In order to promote assessors' work efficiency and speed up the overall procedure, in this paper, we propose a dialogue-based information extraction system that integrates advanced NLP technologies for medical insurance assessment. With the assistance of our system, the average time cost of the procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes, and the total human resources cost is saved 30% compared with the previous offline procedure.

This deadly infection has a high all-cause mortality rate and imposes a significant economic, epidemiological, and humanistic burden on the patients and healthcare system. Evidence from the published epidemiological studies showed the varying prevalence of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). This study aims to compute the pooled prevalence of CAM and other associated clinical outcomes. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and WHO COVID-19 databases were scanned to retrieve the relevant articles until August 2021. All studies reporting the prevalence of mucormycosis among COVID-19 patients were eligible for inclusion. Two investigators independently screened the articles against the selection criteria, extracted the data, and performed the quality assessment using the JBI tool. The pooled prevalence of CAM was the primary outcome, and the pooled prevalence of diabetes, steroid exposure, and the mortality rate were the secondary outcomes of interest. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2 was used for performing the meta-analysis. This meta-analysis comprised six studies with a pooled sample size of 52,916 COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 62.12  9.69 years. The mean duration of mucormycosis onset was 14.59  6.88 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled prevalence of CAM (seven cases per 1000 patients) was 50 times higher than the highest recorded background of mucormycosis (0.14 cases per 1000 patients). A high mortality rate was found among CAM patients with a pooled prevalence rate of 29.6% (95% CI: 17.2C45.9%).

Like other +RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on host cell metabolic machinery to survive and replicate, remodeling cellular membranes to generate sites of viral replication. Viral RNA-containing double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are a striking feature of +RNA viral replication and are abundant in SARS-CoV-2Cinfected cells. Their generation involves rewiring of host lipid metabolism, including lipid biosynthetic pathways. Viruses can also redirect lipids from host cell organelles; lipid exchange at membrane contact sites, where the membranes of adjacent organelles are in close apposition, has been implicated in the replication of several +RNA viruses. Here we review current understanding of DMV biogenesis. With a focus on the exploitation of contact site machinery by +RNA viruses to generate replication organelles, we discuss evidence that similar mechanisms support SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting its RNA from the host cell immune response.","output":"Exploiting Connections for Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Borno State, Nigeria has experienced active COVID-19 with quite a number of cases and mortalities. The extensive global campaign to create awareness about the pandemic and safety measures through various stakeholders appeared to have worked, especially when it became obvious that people in Borno keyed into safety protocols and observed the lockdown. They wore face masks, routinely applied hand sanitizers and handwashing in public places. It was observed, at some points however, there was obvious nonadherence to these protocols. Therefore, this study examines adherence to COVID-19 safety protocol issues in the state. Could the noncompliance be by those not aware or knowledgeable about the pandemic? Are there issues with the sources of information? The objectives of the study are to determine: the sources of information/knowledge on COVID-19;the effectiveness of the sources of information/knowledge on COVID-19;level of compliance to COVID-19 preventive/safety measures, and to identify challenges in complying with COVID-19 safety/preventive measures. The study used knowledge, attitude and practice theory employed survey method as well as convenience and purposive sampling techniques to select 2949 respondents across three LGAs in the state. The study found that people are aware and knowledgeable about the pandemic. The mass media, especially radio are the major sources of information. The noncompliance to COVID-19 safety protocol is largely due lack of fund to purchase and use face mask and hand sanitizer.

METHODS: We carried out a population-based caseCcontrol study in the Lombardy region of Italy. A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: Among both case patients and controls, the mean (SD) age was 6813 years, and 37% were women. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. The online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. RESULTS: A total of 992 randomly drawn patients with mental illness from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region responded to the questionnaire (response rate = 21.6%). The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns regarding the coronavirus, less contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care.

Because they allow a very easy way of binding recombinant proteins to cellulose, they have become widespread in many biotechnological applications involving cellulose. One commonly used variant is the CBMCipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Here we studied the oligomerization behavior of CBMCipA, as such solution association may have an impact on its use. As the principal approach, we used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. To enhance our understanding of the possible interactions, we used molecular dynamics simulations. By analysis of the sedimentation velocity data by a discrete model genetic algorithm and by building a binding isotherm based on weight average sedimentation coefficient and by global fitting of sedimentation equilibrium data we found that the CBMCipA shows a weak dimerization interaction with a dissociation constant KD of 90  30 M. As the KD of CBMCipA binding to cellulose is below 1 M, we conclude that the dimerization is unlikely to affect cellulose binding.

Reciprocally, whether an epidemic can deter citizens from voting has not been often studied. We aimed to investigate such relationships for France during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS: We performed an observational study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects model. All hospitals with COVID-19 patients were included (18 March 2020C17 April 2020). Abstention rate of a concomitant national election was collected. RESULTS: Mean abstention rate in 2020 among departments was 52.5%  6.4% and had increased by a mean of 18.8% as compared with the 2014 election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention between the two elections among the departments (P < 0.001). Among departments with a high outbreak intensity, those with a higher participation were not affected by significantly higher COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model fitted the data from the different departments with a high degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a significant association between participation and number of admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020:  = C5.36, P < 1e(?9) and 2014:  = C3.15, P < 1e(?6)) contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election. Participation was not associated with the position of the inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread.

We investigate how this epidemic has influenced attention dynamics on the biggest Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo in the period December 16, 2019 - April 17, 2020. We focus on the real-time Hot Search List (HSL), which provides the ranking of the most popular 50 hashtags based on the amount of Sina Weibo searches on them. We show, how the specific events, measures and developments during the epidemic affected the emergence of new hashtags and the ranking on the HSL. A significant increase of COVID-19 related hashtags started to occur on HSL around January 20, 2020, when the transmission of the disease between humans was announced. Then very rapidly a situation was reached, where the participation of the COVID-related hashtags occupied 30-70% of the HSL, however, with changing content. We give an analysis of how the hashtag topics changed during the investigated time span and conclude that there are three periods separated by February 12 and March 12. In period 1, we see strong topical correlations and clustering of hashtags; in period 2, the correlations are weakened, without clustering pattern; in period 3, we see potential of clustering while not as strong as in period 1. To quantify the dynamics of HSL we measured the lifetimes of hashtags on the list and the rank diversity at given ranks. Our observations indicate attention diversification since the COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China and a higher rank diversity at the top 15 ranks on HSL due to the COVID-19 related hashtags, a drastic attention decay shortly after the outburst and a slower decay for a longer period.","output":"Attention dynamics on the Chinese social media Sina Weibo during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a slightly obese 39-year-old patient with a severe course of COVID-19 pneumonia.

A new strategy of combining filtering and improved voltage-controlled current was employed to design the current source for a simplified system structure, and a new differential receiver circuit consisting of a buffer amplification and a differential amplification was proposed to design the voltage measurement unit for high precision. Moreover, a Bluetooth interface was adopted for wireless data transmission, and components characterized by low power consumption were selected to minimize the system power consumption.

In this retrospective study we wanted to estimate the amount of unperformed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) studies due to the COVID-19 pandemic at our center. We conducted a single center study using hospital electronic record system by collecting data of TTE studies for the period from 2011 to 2020. We established that the compound annual rate of growth (CARG) in that period was 12.1%, notwithstanding the expected drop in numbers during the pandemic. Taking into account the following CARG, anticipated normal numbers of TTE studies at our center for 2020 and 2021 would be 5471 and 6135 studies respectively. Therefrom we have established that there is in total a predicted burden of about 5500 unperformed TTE studies due to the COVID-19 pandemic as of March 2021 at our center. All these affected patients have either been put on waiting lists, delaying their work-up, or diverted to other echocardiography centers, increasing the local burden of work. The results of this study urge that it is of utmost importance to reinstate the TTE diagnostic facilities of our center as soon as possible, in order to work off the accumulated recess TTE studies on waiting lists. Also, every week of idling cycle due to the extended hospital lockdown generates a further anticipated deficit of 118 unperformed TTE studies in 2021 at our center alone.

Lining the hundreds of millions of hepatic sinusoids in the human liver the LSECs are perfectly located to survey the constituents of the blood. These cells are equipped with high-affinity receptors and an intracellular vesicle transport apparatus, enabling a remarkably efficient machinery for removal of large molecules and nanoparticles from the blood, thus contributing importantly to maintain blood and tissue homeostasis. We describe here central aspects of LSEC signature receptors that enable the cells to recognize and internalize blood-borne waste macromolecules at great speed and high capacity. Notably, this blood clearance system is a silent process, in the sense that it usually neither requires or elicits cell activation or immune responses. Most of our knowledge about LSECs arises from studies in animals, of which mouse and rat make up the great majority, and some species differences relevant for extrapolating from animal models to human are discussed. In the last part of the review, we discuss comparative aspects of the LSEC scavenger functions and specialized scavenger endothelial cells (SECs) in other vascular beds and in different vertebrate classes. In conclusion, the activity of LSECs and other SECs prevent exposure of a great number of waste products to the immune system, and molecules with noxious biological activities are effectively silenced by the rapid clearance in LSECs. An undesired consequence of this avid scavenging system is unwanted uptake of nanomedicines and biologics in the cells. As the development of this new generation of therapeutics evolves, there will be a sharp increase in the need to understand the clearance function of LSECs in health and disease. There is still a significant knowledge gap in how the LSEC clearance function is affected in liver disease.","output":"The Scavenger Function of Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was performed to elucidate whether the route of booster vaccination affects the immune response against respiratory vaccine viruses in pre-weaning beef calves that receive primary intranasal (IN) vaccination during the first month of life.

Twenty-one beef calves were administered 2 mL of an IN MLV vaccine containing BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V (Inforce3?) between one and five weeks of age. Sixty days after primary vaccination, calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups: IN-MLV (n = 11): Calves received 2 mL of the same IN MLV vaccine used for primary vaccination and 2 mL of a SC MLV vaccine containing BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi- Shield GOLD? BVD). SC-MLV (n = 10): Calves were administered 2 mL of a MLV vaccine containing, BHV1, BRSV, BPI3V, and BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi-Shield GOLD? 5). Blood and nasal secretion samples were collected on days -61 (primary vaccination), -28, -14, 0 (booster vaccination), 14, 21, 28, 42 and 60 for determination of SNA titers, cytokine gene expression analysis and nasal virus-specific IgA concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis through PROC GLIMMIX of SAS?. Booster vaccination by neither IN nor SC routes induced a significant increase in SNA titers against BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA titers (on day 42) and IgA concentration in nasal secretions (on days 21 and 42) compared to calves receiving IN booster vaccination. Both IN and SC booster vaccination were able to stimulate the production of BHV1-specific IgA in nasal secretions. In summary, booster vaccination of young beef calves using either SC or IN route two months after IN MLV primary vaccination resulted in comparable SNA titers, cytokine gene expression profile and virus-specific IgA concentration in nasal secretions. Only a few differences in the systemic and mucosal immune response against BHV1 and BRSV were observed.

Many countries have enacted policies such as mandatory school closures, business closures, and self-quarantining to keep people at home and prevent further spread of the virus. Previous research has shown that pandemics and subsequent disease containment measures negatively affect children and families, both psychosocially and economically. OBJECTIVES: The current study explores the potential psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent disease containment measures on a number of domains (employment/business, education, finances, medical care, access to medication, technology, children/family, access to community services) through an online survey. The current abstract focuses on the emotional well-being of children and how families have been affected by the restrictions and changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN/METHODS: Participants were asked to complete an online survey through a secure portal. The survey consisted of questions about household demographics and socio-economic status (SES), as well as five psychometric scales measuring satisfaction with life, psychological well-being, anxiety, depression, and substance use, and specific questions about how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted respondents daily lives in the previously identified domains. This is the first of four longitudinal surveys that will be conducted throughout this study. RESULTS: A total of 571 participants completed the survey. Of these participants, 41.3% identified as being a parent or guardian with children under 18. The focus of this abstract is the subset of respondents with children. Roughly three quarters of participants identified that their children were emotionally impacted by COVID-19, the school closures, or missing friends or family (Yes = 46.6%; Somewhat = 30.5%). Parents also reported loss of access to childcare, disruptions to their visits with their children living outside the home, and feeling like they could not access timely medical care for their children. Demographic information and other relevant responses and information can be found in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come and will shape an entire generation of children. Even in the current sample, which consisted largely of individuals from medium-high SES households, most reported that children had been impacted emotionally. Understanding and mitigating the impact on children and adapting resources in the short term and the long-term to meet the growing needs of our communities must be top priorities for pediatricians and community service providers.

Here, we report the use of lentiviral vectors for long-term in vivo delivery of RNAi selectively to resident alveolar macrophages (AMs), key immune effector cells in the lung. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this approach by RNAi-based downregulation of p65 (RelA), a component of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional regulator, nuclear factor B (NF-B) and a key participant in lung disease pathogenesis. In vivo RNAi delivery results in decreased induction of NF-B and downstream neutrophilic chemokines in transduced AMs as well as attenuated lung neutrophilia following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through concurrent delivery of a novel lentiviral reporter vector (lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP) we track in vivo expression of NF-B target genes in real time, a critical step towards extending RNAi-based therapy to longstanding lung diseases. Application of this system reveals that resident AMs persist in the airspaces of mice following the resolution of LPS-induced inflammation, thus allowing these localized cells to be used as effective vehicles for prolonged RNAi delivery in disease settings.","output":"Lentiviral delivery of RNAi for in vivo lineage-specific modulation of gene expression in mouse lung macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is emerging as a global health threat and shows a higher risk for men than women.

The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients.

Age is the greatest risk factor for most AD and accumulating evidence suggests that age-dependent elevation of asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) in the brain may represent a new biological marker for predicting AD. However, this speculation remains to be explored with an appropriate assay method because mammalian AEP exists in many organs and the level of AEP in body fluid isnt proportional to its concentration in brain parenchyma. To this end, we here modified gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) into an AEP-responsive imaging probe and choose transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice as an animal model of AD. Our aim is to determine whether imaging of brain AEP can be used to predict AD pathology. RESULTS: This AEP-responsive imaging probe AuNPs-Cy5.5-A&C consisted of two particles, AuNPs-Cy5.5-AK and AuNPs-Cy5.5-CABT, which were respectively modified with AlaCAlaCAsnCCysCLys (AK) and 2-cyano-6-aminobenzothiazole (CABT). We showed that AuNPs-Cy5.5-A&C could be selectively activated by AEP to aggregate and emit strong fluorescence. Moreover, AuNPs-Cy5.5-A&C displayed a general applicability in various cell lines and its florescence intensity correlated well with AEP activity in these cells. In the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice , AEP activity was increased at an early disease stage of AD that precedes formation of senile plaques and cognitive impairment. Pharmacological inhibition of AEP with -secretase inhibitor 11 (10 mg kg(?1), p.o.) reduced production of -amyloid (A) and ameliorated memory loss. Therefore, elevation of AEP is an early sign of AD onset. Finally, we showed that live animal imaging with this AEP-responsive probe could monitor the up-regulated AEP in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The current work provided a proof of concept that assessment of brain AEP activity by in vivo imaging assay is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.

Due to technological breakthroughs and the COVID-19 pandemic, human interactions now predominantly occur online, leading to two situations: other peoples faces cannot be seen, but yours can, and vice versa. However, the relationships among watching, being watched, and face-to-face interaction are unclear in existing papers. This paper separately measures the effects of both watching and being watched on human interactions using a trust game. I derive the optimal behaviors of senders and receivers in the trust game and empirically validate it through a controlled experiment. The results show that more than half of the participants perform the optimal behavior. They also indicate that both watching and being watched enhance human trust and reciprocity, while the synergy effect of face-to-face is not observed. Additionally, women reciprocate more when they are watched, and trust increases when participants are paired with the opposite gender and can watch their partner. This paper theoretically concludes that the former comes from womens social pressure that they should be reciprocators, and the latter from participants beliefs that the opposite gender reciprocates more than the same gender does. These results propose a framework based on watching and being watched affecting human behaviors and emphasize the importance of face-to-face communication in online human interactions.","output":"Watching, being watched, and human interactions: evidence from trust games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die M?glichkeiten zur Gestaltung digitaler Lehr- und Lernkonzepte sind vielf?ltig und mit verschiedenen Potenzialen verbunden Trotz zahlreicher Bestrebungen digitale Bildungsangebote vermehrt an Hochschulen, Schulen und im Arbeitskontext zu etablieren, hat erst die rasante Ausbreitung von Covid-19 zu einem weitrechenden Umdenken gefhrt In diesem Beitrag wird daher das Konzept AC:DC zum digitalen, agilen und kollaborativen Lernen vorgestellt, welches im Sommersemester 2020 erstmals in einer Mastervorlesung eingesetzt wurde Die Evaluation der Lehrveranstaltung hat berwiegend positive Resultate gezeigt, vor allem in Hinblick auf den erreichten Lernerfolg","output":"AC:DC C Agiles und kollaboratives digitales Klassenzimmer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite recent leaps in modern medicine, progress in the treatment of neurological diseases remains slow.

In this study, we report the cumulative incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 291 SOT recipients. The COVID-19 cumulative incidence in SOT recipients resulted slightly higher compared to that of age-matched population during the study period. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody frequency was around 2.6-fold higher than the incidence of cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, suggesting that the number of SOT recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is likely higher than described. In symptomatic recipients, kidney transplant was associated with a higher risk of developing moderate/critical disease, while common risk factors, including age and comorbidities, resulted less relevant for COVID-19 severity. Due to the high estimated crude mortality, symptomatic SOT recipients should be considered at high risk in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ABSTRACT: Background: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients may be at increased risk for severe disease and mortality from COVID-19 because of immunosuppression and prolonged end-stage organ disease. As a transplant center serving a diverse patient population, we report the cumulative incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of SOT recipients. Methods: We prospectively included in this observational study SOT recipients with a functioning kidney (n = 201), pancreas  kidney (n = 66) or islet transplant (n = 24), attending outpatient regular follow-up at the San Raffaele Hospital from February 2020 to April 2021. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested in all patients by a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. Results: Of the 291 SOT recipients, 30 (10.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period and prevalence was not different among different transplants. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody frequency was around 2.6-fold higher than the incidence of cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. As for the WHO COVID-19 severity classification, 19 (63.3%) SOT recipients were mild, nine (30%) were moderate, and two were critical and died yielding a crude mortality rate in our patient population of 6.7%. Kidney transplant (OR 12.9 (1.1C150) p = 0.041) was associated with an increased risk for moderate/critical disease, while statin therapy (OR 0.116 (0.015C0.926) p = 0.042) and pancreas/islet transplant (OR 0.077 (0.007C0.906) p = 0.041) were protective. Conclusions: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOT recipients may be higher than previously described.

However, thus far, no recommendations have been published on when and how to start carrying out elective, nonurgent surgery on COVID-19-negative patients after the epidemic peak. Objective: The aims of the study are to determine the best approach for reintroduction of elective procedures based on their preoperative screening by the respiratory scoring system and to provide a scientific base for solid elective surgery protocols that may be implemented in the moment when a country or region meets the criteria to implement elective, nonurgent procedures. Methodology: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent bariatric surgery between March and June 2020, during the pandemic of COVID-19. The study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2 different health institutions. The study participants were men and women with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2) and with a respiratory score of <= 3. The data were analyzed on SPSS version 22. Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables were reported as mean +/- SD or median (interquartile range [IQR]). The qualitative variables were reported as frequency and percentage. Results: The total number of patients was 90. The mean age of the patients was 32.73 +/- 7.81 years, and a greater proportion (n = 48;56.5%) of them were men. The mean BMI of the patients was 42.29 +/- 7.40 kg/m(2). About 37 (41.1%) patients reported a previous history of surgery. Moreover, 36 (40.0%) patients presented with comorbidities. Only 1 (1.1%) patient was tested for COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) before surgery and tested negative. We observed that most patients (n = 80;88.9% ) underwent lap sleeve gastrectomy. The median length of surgery was 50 (IQR, 17) minutes, and the median length of hospital stay was 36 (IQR, 24) hours. After surgery, none of the patients developed any complications, and none were admitted to the intensive care unit. After surgery, only 2 (2.2%) patients were tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR, and 100% tested negative. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, before considering patients for elective surgery, they should be screened. For patients who are obese or have underlying comorbidities, if on screening, their respiratory score is <= 3, indicating low risk of respiratory illness, elective procedures should continue. Strict precautionary measures should be followed, and a limited number of surgeries should be performed.","output":"Safety of Bariatric Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is There a Need to Screen Low-Risk Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media has become a mainstream channel of communication during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

These sudden changes in daily life have also changed the way we relate to others, in addition to creating a climate of uncertainty and fear. Therefore, the objective of this review is to compile published data of the consequences of suicidal behavior in the first months from the onset of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The analysis reflects a concern about issues related to suicide since the beginning of the pandemic. A large number of online surveys have been released and have provided data on relatively large populations. The percentage of the population with suicidal ideation in that period seems to be approximately 5C15%. Many studies associate suicidal ideation with being young, female, and presence of sleep problems. Surveys of healthcare workers do not seem to indicate a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation compared to the general population. The incidence of suicide attempts seen in emergency departments did not seem to change, while the number of visits for other issues, unrelated to suicide, did decrease. The few studies on completed suicide do not indicate an increase in incidence in these first 6 months since March 2020, when the WHO declared the start of the pandemic. SUMMARY: It does not seem that there have been major changes in the figures related to suicidal behavior in the studies from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, although it is still too early to know the consequences it will have long term.

Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firmsa measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.","output":"Fragmentation of production amplifies systemic risks from extreme events in supply-chain networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a data-driven approach for COVID-19 outbreak modeling and forecasting, which can be used by public policy and decision makers to control the outbreak through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI).

The third dose was effective in mounting a significant humoral and cellular immune response. Methods: We followed BNT162b2-vaccinated health-care workers monthly for IgG and neutralizing antibody (NeutAb) titers. Avidity, T-cell activation and microneutralization of sera against different variants of concern (VOC) were assessed for a sub-cohort. Linear mixed models were used to compare the durability of the second and third doses, and to assess if Omicron breakthrough infections were associated with waning dynamics. Results: Overall 3972 participants with a third dose were followed, the rate of waning of IgG and NeutAb was slower after the third (1.32%/day and 1.32%/day, respectively) compared to the second (2.26%/per day and 3.34%/day) dose. Live-neutralization of Omicron VOC was lower compared to previous strains and demonstrated similar waning from 111 (95%CI:75-166) to 26 (95%CI:16-42) within 4 months. Mean T cell activity decreased from 98+-5.4 T cells/106 PBMC to 59+-9.3, within 3-5 months. Omicron breakthrough infections were associated with lower IgG peak (ratio of means 0.86 95%CI 0.80-0.91), and among participants over 65y with faster waning of both IgG and NeutAb (ratio of mean rates 1.40 95% CI 1.13-1.68 and 3.58 95% CI 1.92-6.67). No waining in IgG avidity was obsereved during 112 days after the 3rd dose. Conclusion: The third dose is more durable than the second dose, yet Omicron is relatively resistant to direct neutralization.

Limited information exists about the effect of multiday continuous endurance exercise on blood glucose control and appropriate intake of food and drink in a female athlete. The present study aimed to examine the variation of blood glucose control and its relationship with nutritional intake and running performance in a professional female athlete during a 155.7 h ultramarathon race with little sleep. Methods: We divided the mountain course of 438 km into 33 segments by timing gates and continuously monitored the participants glucose profile throughout the ultramarathon. The running speed in each segment was standardized to the scheduled required time-based on three trial runs. Concurrently, the accompanying runners recorded the participants food and drink intake. Nutrient, energy, and water intake were then calculated. Results: Throughout the ultramarathon of 155.7 h, including 16.0 h of rest and sleep, diurnal variation had almost disappeared with the overall increase in blood glucose levels (25C30 mg/dL) compared with that during resting (p < 0.0001). Plasma total protein and triglyceride levels were decreased after the ultramarathon. The intake of protein and fat directly or indirectly contributed to maintaining blood glucose levels and running speed as substrates for gluconeogenesis or as alternative sources of energy when the carbohydrate intake was at a lower recommended limit. The higher amounts of nutrient intakes from solid foods correlated with a higher running pace compared with those from liquids and gels to supply carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Conclusion: Carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake from solid foods contributed to maintaining a fast pace with a steady, mild rise in blood glucose levels compared with liquids and gels when female runner completed a multiday continuous ultramarathon with little sleep.","output":"Contribution of Solid Food to Achieve Individual Nutritional Requirement during a Continuous 438 km Mountain Ultramarathon in Female Athlete"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital equity and sustainable development are in the focus of attention nowadays.

Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, finetuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures.

To that end, it is important to understand the discourses about COVID-19 vaccination and attend to the publics emotions underlying those discourses.We collect tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from March 2020 to March 2021. In total, 304,292 tweets from 134,015 users are collected. We conduct a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling analysis and a sentiment analysis to analyze the discourse themes and sentiments.This study identifies seven themes of COVID-19 vaccine-related discourses. Vaccine advocacy (24.82%) is the most widely discussed topic about COVID-19 vaccines, followed by vaccine hesitancy (22.29%), vaccine rollout (12.99%), vaccine facts (12.61%), recognition for healthcare workers (12.47%), vaccine side effects (10.07%), and vaccine policies (4.75%). Trust is the most salient emotion associated with COVID-19 vaccine discourses, followed by anticipation, fear, joy, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust. Among the seven topics, vaccine advocacy tweets are most likely to receive likes and comments, and vaccine fact tweets are most likely to receive retweets.When talking about vaccines, publics emotions are dominated by trust and anticipation, yet mixed with fear and sadness. Although tweets about vaccine hesitancy are prevalent on Twitter, those messages receive fewer likes and comments than vaccine advocacy messages. Over time, tweets about vaccine advocacy and vaccine facts become more dominant whereas tweets about vaccine hesitancy become less dominant among COVID-19 vaccine discourses, suggesting that publics become more confident about COVID-19 vaccines as they obtain more information.

This view changed since the beginning of this century, with the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, two zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates of approximately 10% and 35%, respectively. Despite the importance of these pathogens, no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections became available. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated. Several had encouraging results, particularly the ACTT-1 double blind, randomized, and placebo controlled trial that has shown shortening of the time to recovery in hospitalized patients treated with remdesivir. The results of other trials were instead negative. Here, we provide an overview of remdesivir discovery, molecular mechanism of action, and initial and current clinical studies on its efficacy.","output":"Remdesivir: From Ebola to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite a growing movement toward a knowledge-user-driven research process, our understanding of the generation, implementation and evaluation of specific approaches in the integrated knowledge translation (iKT) toolbox that aim to engage health and healthcare knowledge users is limited. Health hackathons offer an innovative approach with potential to generate direct and indirect health-related outcomes benefitting participants, knowledge users and the broader population. In May 2019, our research team hosted Waterlupus, a health hackathon to improve the economic lives of individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Canada. Waterlupus was held with a multi-stakeholder group of 50 participants that included advocacy organization representatives, policy-makers, researchers, physicians, individuals with lived experience and students. While the hackathon generated viable solutions with the potential to positively impact the lives of individuals with SLE, understanding how participants perceived the hackathon as an iKT tool is critical in the planning and implementation of future iKT research. METHODS: Semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with Waterlupus participants (n = 13) between August and November 2019 to (1) explore participant experiences of the hackathon; (2) investigate participant-identified hackathon outcomes; and (3) elicit recommendations for future iKT research using health hackathons. RESULTS: Participants provided feedback on the format and organization of Waterlupus, and identified direct and indirect outcomes to knowledge users, students and researchers beyond the innovations generated at the event. While the majority (n = 11) had never participated in a hackathon prior to Waterlupus, all 13 stated they would participate in future hackathons. Positive outcomes identified include connecting with students and other SLE stakeholders, the formation of professional and support networks, increased awareness of SLE, as well as the innovations generated. Participant recommendations for future health hackathons include the addition of stakeholders from industry or technology, and the need for clear and designated roles for stakeholders to ensure efficient use of resources. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributes to a limited literature regarding the use of health hackathons for social innovation, and offers knowledge-user suggestions relevant to the implementation of future iKT events, and hackathons specifically.

Effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes including hemocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAE) are not well established. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Pubmed and Embase databases from inception through November 25, 2020 to compare post-LVAD outcomes in patients with or without PDE5i use. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I2 statistic were calculated. RESULTS: Thirteen observational studies were included in this analysis. Use of PDE5i was not significantly associated with lower postoperative RVF (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.02-5.96, p=0.41). There was no significant association between PDE5i and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (OR 1.23, 95%CI 0.76-1.98, p=0.2), overall stroke (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.21-1.68, p=0.17), ischemic stroke (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.09-4.07, p=0.38), and pump thrombosis (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.14-3.54, p=0.46).

We demonstrated that the E protein, both as a recombinant soluble protein and as a native membrane protein associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, interacts physically with the TLR2 receptor in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that the specific interaction with the TLR2 pathway activates the NF-B transcription factor and stimulates the production of the CXCL8 inflammatory chemokine. In agreement with the importance of NF-B in the TLR signaling pathway, we showed that the chemical inhibition of this transcription factor leads to significant inhibition of CXCL8 production, while the blockade of the P38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases only results in partial CXCL8 inhibition. Overall, our findings propose the envelope (E) protein as a novel molecular target for COVID-19 interventions: either (i) by exploring the therapeutic effect of anti-E blocking/neutralizing antibodies in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, or (ii) as a promising non-spike SARS-CoV-2 antigen candidate for inclusion in the development of next-generation prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 infection and disease.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) Protein Binds and Activates TLR2 Pathway: A Novel Molecular Target for COVID-19 Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few longitudinal studies have systematically investigated whether or how individual musculoskeletal conditions (IMCs) convey risks for negative psychological health outcomes, and approaches to assess such risk in the older population are lacking. In this Irish nationally representative longitudinal prospective study of 6,715 individuals aged 50 and above, machine learning algorithms and various models, including mediation models, were employed to elaborate the underlying mechanisms of IMCs leading to depression and to develop an IMC-induced negative psychological risk (IMCPR) classification approach. Resultantly, arthritis [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.233 (1.700C2.927)], osteoporosis [1.681 (1.133C2.421)], and musculoskeletal chronic pain [MCP, 2.404 (1.838C3.151)] were found to increase the risk of depression after 2 years, while fracture and joint replacement did not. Interestingly, mediation models further demonstrated that arthritis per se did not increase the risk of depression; such risk was augmented only when arthritis-induced restrictions of activities (ARA) existed [proportion of mediation: 316.3% (ARA of usual), 213.3% (ARA of social and leisure), and 251.3% (ARA of sleep)]. The random forest algorithm attested that osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis, contributed the most to depressive symptoms. Moreover, bone mineral density was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Systemic pain contributed the most to the increased risk of depression, followed by back, knee, hip, and foot pain (mean Gini-Index: 3.778, 2.442, 1.980, 1.438, and 0.879, respectively). Based on the aforementioned findings, the IMCPR classification approach was developed using an interpretable machine learning model, which stratifies participants into three grades. Among the IMCPR grades, patients with a grade of severe had higher odds of depression than those with a mild [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 4.055 (2.907C5.498)] or moderate [3.584 (2.101C5.883)] grade. Females with a severe grade had higher odds of depression by 334.0% relative to those with a mild grade, while males had a relative risk of 258.4%.

This cross-sectional study has used a nutrigenetic approach to investigate the interaction between metabolic-genetic risk score (GRS) and dietary intake on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in 396 unrelated Turkish adults, aged 24C50 years. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in those with a metabolic-GRS  1 risk allele than those with a metabolic-GRS < 1 risk allele (p = 0.020). A significant interaction between metabolic-GRS and dietary fat intake (energy%) on serum 25(OH)D levels was identified (P(interaction) = 0.040). Participants carrying a metabolic-GRS  1 risk allele and consuming a high fat diet (38% of energy = 122.3  52.51 g/day) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentration (p = 0.006) in comparison to those consuming a low-fat diet (<38% of energy = 82.5  37.36 g/d). In conclusion, our study suggests a novel interaction between metabolic-GRS and dietary fat intake on serum 25(OH)D level, which emphasises that following the current dietary fat intake recommendation (<35% total fat) could be important in reducing the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this Turkish population. Nevertheless, further larger studies are needed to verify this interaction, before implementing personalized dietary recommendations for the maintenance of optimal vitamin D status.","output":"Interaction between Dietary Fat Intake and Metabolic Genetic Risk Score on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations in a Turkish Adult Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase the risk for mental health problems. However, there is a lack of data targeting the role of ACEs for one of the most prevalent mental health problems in health-care professionals: burnout. Objective We aimed to assess the relationship between ACEs and the core burnout dimension emotional exhaustion (EE). As health-care professionals have been facing particular challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we furthermore aimed to assess the role of COVID-19 associated burden in the interplay between ACEs and EE. Methods During the first lockdown in Germany, a total of 2500 medical healthcare professionals were questioned in a cross-sectional online survey. Questions targeted, among others, sociodemographics, ACEs, COVID-19-associated problems (e.g. increase of workload, worries about relatives and patients) and emotional exhaustion, measured by the respective dimension of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results In German health-care professionals, ACEs were associated with a higher EE score. The number of experienced ACEs was associated with the majority of assessed COVID-19-associated problems. An increasing number of ACEs predicted higher EE scores, controlling for gender. The association between ACEs and EE was mediated significantly by COVID-19-associated problems. These included maladaptive coping strategies such as increased smoking, drinking and use of antidepressants/tranquilizers, feeling less protected by measures of the employee or the state, a greater feeling of being burdened by COVID-19-associated problems and greater exhaustion and sleep problems. Conclusion Our findings suggest ACEs as significant risk factor for EE in German health-care professionals. The current pandemic means a significant burden that further pronounces this risk. HIGHLIGHTS Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) predicted higher scores of emotional exhaustion (EE) in German healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I present an argument to connect the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy to the issue of trust and then argue for what an education about vaccines in school science might look like that takes seriously the notion of respect for students, including students who hold views about vaccination with which science teachers might disagree. Trust in others (people and institutions) varies greatly, both between countries and within countries, and depends on the characteristics of both trustor and trustee, and there are great differences in the extent to which people trust vaccines. However, it is a mistake to think that people who do not trust vaccines are simply ill-informed. There are a range of reasons for rejecting what is often an unexamined narrative about vaccines, namely that vaccines are always desirable. Many people come from communities that have sound reasons for being suspicious of what they are told by governments, business and the medical establishment. COVID-19 and earlier reactions to vaccination health scares show how important high-quality education about vaccines is. Much of that education can take place out of school, but the foundations are laid in school. Vaccine rejection and hesitancy have major global public health implications.

We evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an EUA Covid-19 vaccine regimen. MethodsIn this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten U.S. sites, adults who received one of three EUA Covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 100-g, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 virus particles, or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 30-g; nine combinations). The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29. Results458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.CoV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 booster vaccines. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. Injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants. Booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a D614G pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold.

A consistent method is needed for public health research, to identify ED encounters associated with aggression. The aim of this study was to develop such a screening procedure. DATA SOURCES Electronic records and administrative claims data related to MH related ED encounters at one of Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) Children's Hospitals in the United States from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. STUDY DESIGN The authors selected a combination of ICD-10 codes to screen MH ED encounters for aggression; and then conducted a chart review to compare characteristics of groups that screened positive vs. screened negative, and groups with confirmed vs. without confirmed aggression. DATA EXTRACTION METHOD Unique ED encounters associated with a MH related ICD-10 code from a one-year period at the study institution were extracted (n = 3092 MH ED encounters). Encounters with any aggression-associated codes were identified as \\"screen-positive\\" (N = 349). From the remaining \\"screen-negative\\" encounters, 352 unique encounters were randomly selected as a comparison group. Both groups were chart reviewed to investigate the accuracy of the screening method. MAIN FINDING Chart review confirmed aggression in 287 of 349 screen-positive and 48 of 352 select screen-negative, chart-reviewed encounters. Additional codes were added, with a goal of finding the combination of codes with the highest accuracy.

We estimated how COVID\\\\19\\\\related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China, over a one\\\\ and five\\\\year time horizon. METHODS: Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility\\\\based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of all sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%), but initial data indicated no change in viral suppression. A mathematical model of HIV transmission/treatment among MSM was used to estimate the impact of disruptions on HIV infections/HIV\\\\related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over one and five years for 3/4/6\\\\month disruption periods, starting from 1 January 2020. RESULTS: Our model predicted new HIV infections and HIV\\\\related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions (25% virally suppressed MSM stop taking ART) for a three\\\\month period increasing HIV infections by 5% to 14% over one year and deaths by 7% to 12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5% to 14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility HIV testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11% to 23% fewer infections and 0.4% to 1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods (4/6 months) amplified the impact of disruption scenarios. When realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections occurred over one year (3% to 17%), but not for five years (1% increase to 4% decrease), whereas deaths mostly increased over one year (1% to 2%) and five years (1.2 increase to 0.3 decrease). CONCLUSIONS: The overall impact of COVID\\\\19 on new HIV infections and HIV\\\\related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID\\\\19\\\\related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.","output":"The impact of disruptions due to COVID\\\\19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is linked to higher rates of human mortality especially those infected with COVID 19.

We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we introduce a novel paradigm that probes sensitivity of humans to transitions between prior-cost pairs that demand the same optimal policy (metamers) but distinct internal models. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in two experiments that were classically explained by model-based Bayesian theory.

Here we profile the antibody responses of 162 COVID-19 symptomatic patients in the COVID-BioB cohort followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset to find SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, as well as antibodies either recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and nucleoprotein, or specific for S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5C8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression.

The relevance of unconventional, non-capped, and non-poly(A) transcripts to transcriptomics studies remains to be routinely investigated. Knowledge gaps to be filled are the interface between host-encoded circRNAs and viral replication in chronically progressed patients and upon treatment with antiviral drugs.

We have more information and evidence-based health related knowledge, for instance about healthy habits or possible risk behaviors. However, these tools also carry some disadvantages since they also open the door to new social and health risks, in particular during health emergencies. This systematic review aims to study the determinants of infodemics during disease outbreaks, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative methods. Methods: We searched research articles in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Sociological abstracts, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Additional research works were included by searching bibliographies of electronically retrieved review articles. Results: Finally, 42 studies were included in the review. Five determinants of infodemics were identified: (1) information sources; (2) online communities' structure and consensus; (3) communication channels (i.e., mass media, social media, forums, and websites); (4) messages content (i.e., quality of information, sensationalism, etc.,); and (5) context (e.g., social consensus, health emergencies, public opinion, etc.).

Globally, the leading childhood respiratory pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus and the influenza virus. There is a growing body of evidence describing the innate immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D during challenge with respiratory pathogens, but recent systematic and unbiased synthesis of data is lacking, and future research directions are unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic PubMed literature search using the terms vitamin D and Streptococcus pneumoniae or Respiratory Syncytial Virus or Influenza. A priori inclusion criteria restricted the review to in vitro studies investigating the effect of vitamin D metabolites on human innate immune cells (primary, differentiated or immortalised) in response to stimulation with the specified respiratory pathogens. Eleven studies met our criteria. Despite some heterogeneity across pathogens and innate cell types, vitamin D modulated pathogen recognition receptor (PRRs: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, TLR7 and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)) expression; increased antimicrobial peptide expression (LL-37, human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1-3 and -defensin); modulated autophagosome production reducing apoptosis; and modulated production of inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin (IL) -1, tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), interferon-?

Differential modulation of PRRs and IL-1 was reported across immune cell types; however, this may be due to the experimental design. None of the studies specifically focused on immune responses in cells derived from children. In summary, vitamin D promotes a balanced immune response, potentially enhancing pathogen sensing and clearance and restricting pathogen induced inflammatory dysregulation. This is likely to be important in controlling both ALRIs and the immunopathology associated with poorer outcomes and progression to chronic lung diseases. Many unknowns remain and further investigation is required to clarify the nuances in vitamin D mediated immune responses by pathogen and immune cell type and to determine whether these in vitro findings translate into enhanced immunity and reduced ALRI in the paediatric clinical setting.","output":"Vitamin D Modulation of the Innate Immune Response to Paediatric Respiratory Pathogens Associated with Acute Lower Respiratory Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The aim of the study was to describe ECG modifications and arrhythmic events in COVID-19 patients undergoing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in different clinical settings.

A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9-16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSION: HCQ administration is safe for a short-term treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection regardless of the clinical setting of delivery, causing only modest QTc prolongation and no directly attributable arrhythmic deaths.","output":"Arrhythmic safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients from different clinical settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential transmission through touching surfaces in clinical environments have impelled the use of conventional and novel methods of disinfection to prevent its spreading.

AIMS: To examine how different COVID-19-related experiences of and worries about adversity contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours. METHOD: Data from 49 324 UK adults in the University College London COVID-19 Social Study were analysed (1 April 2020 to 17 May 2021). Fixed-effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experience and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18C29, 30C44, 45C59 and 60+ years). RESULTS: In total, 26.1% and 7.9% of respondents reported self-harm thoughts and behaviours respectively at least once over the study period. The number of adverse experiences was more strongly related to outcomes than the number of worries. The largest specific adversity contributing to increases in both outcomes was having experienced physical or psychological abuse. Financial worries increased the likelihood of both outcomes in most age groups, and having had COVID-19 increased the likelihood of both outcomes in young (18C29 years) and middle-aged (45C59 years) adults. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic. Given the likelihood that the economic and social consequences of the pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.","output":"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: longitudinal analysis of 49 324 adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common and significant complications after solid organ transplant (SOT).

The formation of stable blood clots or hemostasis is essential to prevent major blood loss and death from excessive bleeding. However, the body's self-coagulation process cannot accomplish timely hemostasis without the assistance of hemostatic agents under some conditions. In the past two decades, topical hemostatic materials and devices containing platelets, fibrin, and polysaccharides have been gradually developed and introduced to induce faster or more stable blood clot formation, updating or iterating traditional hemostatic materials. Despite the various forms and functions of topical hemostatic materials that have been developed for different clinical conditions, uncontrolled hemorrhage still causes over 30% of trauma deaths across the world. Therefore, it is important to fabricate fast, efficient, safe, and ready-to-use novel hemostatic materials. It is necessary to understand the coagulation process and the hemostatic mechanism of different materials to develop novel topical hemostatic agents, such as tissue adhesives and sealants from various natural and synthetic materials.

As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans. In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions. The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms. It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. Recently, cases of fecalCoral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.

The association between obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)) and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay was investigated. Results: In 121 critically ill patients, pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR. Forty-eight patients had obesity (33.5%). The 28-day all-cause mortality was 28.1%. Patients with obesity had no significant difference in 28-day survival in KaplanCMeier curves (log rank p 0.545) compared with patients without obesity. Obesity made no significant contribution in a multivariate Cox regression model for prediction of 28-day mortality (p = 0.124), but age and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were significant independent factors (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively).

Current therapies targeting several neurotransmitter systems are only able to mitigate symptoms partially. It is well recognized that stress and trauma related disorders lead to a prominent inflammatory response in humans, and in several animal models a robust neuroinflammatory response has been observed. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting specific components of the inflammatory response has not been adequately studied in this context. The current study investigated the NLRP3 - Caspase1-IL-1 pathway, which recent research has identified as a major contributor to exacerbated inflammatory response in several peripheral and central nervous system pathological conditions. Using two different models of stress, first - single prolonged restraint stress followed by brief underwater submersion and second - predator odor exposure in mice, we demonstrate heightened anxious behavior in mice one-week after stress. Females in both models display an exacerbated anxiety response than males within the stressed group. Consistent with this data stressed animals demonstrate upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, Caspase1 activity and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in brain, with female animals showing a stronger neuroinflammatory phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation led to a rescue in terms of anxious behavior as well as attenuated neuroinflammatory response, both of which were significantly more prominent in female animals. Further, we observed induction of activated Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an upstream positive regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in hippocampus and amygdala of stressed mice. Next, we conducted proof-of-concept pharmacological BTK inhibitor studies with Ibrutinib, a drug that is already FDA approved for use in certain types of lymphomas and leukemias, as well as a second inhibitor of BTK, LFM-A13. In both sets of experiments, we found inhibition of BTK significantly reduced the anxious behavior in stressed mice and attenuated the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase 1 and IL1. Our results suggest that BTK inhibition can be further investigated in context of human stress and trauma related disorders as a therapeutic strategy.","output":"Pharmacological Inhibition of BTK reduces neuroinflammation and stress induced anxiety in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper offers the authors perspectives from a lens of practice on the paper, Open educational resources and college textbook choices: A review of research on efficacy and perceptions, by John Hilton III published in Educational Technology Research and Development volume 64, pages 573C590 in 2016.

It is therefore fundamental to take into account each neighbourhood's morphological characteristics and the potential population densities each street, square or park can accommodate under such new regulations in order to effectively enforce social distancing rules. Otherwise, certain areas may be rapidly overwhelmed by crowds with citizens unable to maintain the minimum safe distance between individuals. In this paper, we develop a method to identify the potential public space accessibility if social distancing rules are followed and we apply it to three global and highly affected by COVID-19 cities.

Accurate implementation is crucial for optimal IPC practice. Despite the wide promotion of IPC and research thereof in the hospital and nursing home setting, similar efforts are lacking in disability care settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess perceived barriers and facilitators to IPC among professionals working at residential care facilities (RCFs) for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), as well as to identify professional-reported recommendations to improve IPC. METHODS: This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews (before COVID-19) with twelve professionals from five Dutch RCFs for people with IDD. An integrated theoretical approach was used to inform data collection and analysis. Thematic analysis using inductive and deductive approaches was conducted. This study followed the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines. RESULTS: Our findings revealed barriers and facilitators at the guideline, client, professional, professional interaction, professional client interaction, client interaction, organisational, community, and societal level. Six main themes covering multiple barriers and facilitators were identified: (1) guidelines applicability to (work)setting; (2) professionals cognitions and attitude towards IPC (related to educational background); (3) organisational support and priority; (4) educational system; (5) time availability and staff capacity; and (6) task division and change coaches. The main professional-reported recommendations were the introduction of tailored and practical IPC guidelines, structural IPC education and training among all professionals, and client participation. CONCLUSIONS: To promote IPC, multifaceted and multilevel strategies should be implemented, with a preliminary need for improvements on the guideline, professional, and organisational level.

It is a time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone issue for physicians to determine the location of bone lesions which is important for the qualitative diagnosis of bone lesions. In this paper, an automatic fine-grained skeleton segmentation method for WBS is developed. METHOD: The proposed method contains four steps. In the first step, a novel denoising method is proposed to remove the noise from WBS which benefits the location of the skeleton. In the second step, a restoration method based on gray probability distribution is developed to repair the partial contamination caused by the high local density of radionuclide. Then, the standardization for WBS is performed by the exact histogram matching. Finally, the deformation field between the atlas and the input WBS is calculated by registration, and the segmentation mask of the input WBS is obtained by wrapping the segmentation mask of the atlas with the deformation field. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional registration (Morphon): mean square error decreased from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.26 to 26.92, and mean structural similarity increased from 0.9986 to 0.9998.

This makes physical therapy (PT) assessments difficult because of the lack of empirical evidence about the reliability of various clinical measurements performed in a virtual environment. One such procedure is the photometric measurement of craniovertebral (CV) angle. Craniovertebral angle measurement is usually performed in an outpatient setting and is defined as the acute angle formed between a straight line connecting the spinous process of C7 to the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line passing through the spinous process of the C7. Although the photometric measurement of CV angles is considered both valid and reliable in the clinics, no empirical evidence exists about the CV angle measurement reliability when performed in a virtual environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of photometric CV angle measurement using a cloud-based video communication platform. Number of Subjects: 66 subjects (57 females). METHODS: All measurements were performed by two final year PT students who had completed the musculoskeletal part of the curriculum and were blinded to each other's measurements. Each subject was photographed in two postures over a HIPAA-compliant video-based telehealth platform: (1) normal/relaxed posture and (2) ideal posture (posture the subject considered good). Student researcher 1 measured the CV angle in both the relaxed posture and ideal posture, while student researcher 2 measured the CV angle only in the relaxed posture. Each subject's CV angle measurement was performed three times on three separate days and the means were used for further analysis. The shape of the CV angle frequency distribution was assessed using kurtosis and skewness values. Rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and interpreted based on the guidelines provided by Portney and Watkins (2009). RESULTS: The CV angles were normally distributed in both relaxed and ideal postures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relaxed posture was 50.7o  6.3o with kurtosis and skewness of 0.67 and ?0.74 respectively.

The aim of the current study is to validate a Turkish version of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief English-language mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. Participants were assessed using the PGS, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). We surveyed 758 Turkish native speakers who participated online. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factor structure of the PGS was satisfactory. The scale was internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 and a composite reliability of 0.90. The PGS demonstrated construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. Positive correlations of the PGS with the PHQ-4 and the WSAS demonstrated adequate convergent validity. The PGS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of &#8805; 3 (89% sensitivity and 72% specificity). The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining most of the variance (43%) in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These findings closely replicate the original validation study on the PGS in English and suggest that the current Turkish version of the PGS is a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death.","output":"Measuring dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 loss: A Turkish validation study of the Pandemic Grief Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burkholderia mallei is the causative agent of glanders, an incapacitating disease with high mortality rates in respiratory cases.

The first case of C. auris infection was reported in 2009 and infections have been reported in 44 countries. The fungus now represents a major global public health threat. We analyzed cases from the emergence of C. auris infections up until the end of 2020. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will raise awareness in scientists to promote protection and control research pertaining to this pathogen. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for all papers related to C. auris infections up until December 31, 2020. We sorted and organized these data into the following categories: date of publication, patient age and sex, underlying diseases, risk factors for infection, patient mortality information, drug sensitivity information of C. auris isolates, and genetic classification. The (2) test was used to screen for factors that may affect patient mortality. RESULTS: A total of 912 patients were included in the analysis. Theres a higher proportion of men and a high proportion of patients were premature babies and elderly people. The proportions of patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, trauma, and ear disease were also high. More than half of patients had a history of central venous catheter use and a history of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The (2) test revealed that only kidney disease (P < 0.05) was an important risk factor for mortality in C. auris-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive understanding of C. auris was achieved following this retrospective analysis, including the characteristics of C. auris-infected patients. In recent years, increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant C. auris isolates have been identified, and the high mortality rates associated with infection merit greater attention from the medical world.","output":"Retrospective Analysis of the Clinical Characteristics of Candida auris Infection Worldwide From 2009 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV) are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Health care personnel (HCP) are subjected to increased risk of these infections. Therefore, HBV vaccination and post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) are recommended for them. Our objectives in this study were investigate how well the vaccination guidelines for hospital HCP(s) were implemented. Moreover, the prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infections were calculated. To determine the presence of immunological memory, vaccinated personnel negative to antibody against HB surface antigen with one dose of HB vaccine were boosted. METHODS: From 1 July to 30 November 2017, a cross-sectional study among HCPs working in public hospitals were conducted. All HCPs from various professional categories potentially at risk of exposure to contaminated sources were included. The information was gathered via interview and self-administered questionnaire. The questions were focused on the demographic characteristics, HB vaccination and immunity status and time elapsed since initial vaccination series, and frequency of needelstick injuries during the past 12 months of their work. Moreover, the prevalence rate of HBV and HCV infections were calculated. To determine the presence of immunological memory, subjects negative to HBV seromarkers received a booster dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 186 out of 766 participants were male and nurses comprised 71% of personnel. Although all HCP were vaccinated, 84% of them completed the course and less than 5% of them received PVST. According to the results, 0.78, 4.6, and 83% were serologically positive to HBV surface antigen, antibodies against HBV core, and S antigens, respectively. Approximately, 91% of seronegative participants responded to a booster dose and only 0.91% of the personnel was anti-HCV positive. CONCLUSION: Most HCP received full HBV vaccination course. Although a minority did PVST, the HBV vaccine-induced long-term protection and HB vaccine booster were not required. Therefore, policies should be made to increase the rate PVST after immunization. According to the results, the HCV infection rate was low and thus pre-recruitment screening was not necessary.","output":"High level of vaccination and protection against hepatitis B with low rate of HCV infection markers among hospital health care personnel in north of Iran: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is devoted to the lesion of the muscular system in the new coronavirus disease - 2019 The analysis of the literature of Russian and foreign researchers on the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is carried out The main target of COVID-19 (CoronaVIrus Disease 2019) is the vascular endothelium To enter cells, the virus uses a receptor - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) It has been shown that up to three viruses can attach to one target Skeletal muscles also have ACE2 In COVID-19, involvement of the muscular system in the pathological process is a predictor of a poor prognosis In 20% of hospitalized COVID 19 patients, laboratory signs of heart muscle damage are found The main mechanisms of muscle damage in COVID 19 include ACE2-dependent, viral load, cytokine storm, acute hypoxemia, and drug toxicity Damage to the muscular system in COVID 19 is an additional risk factor for death The presented work provides information on the possible pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of myopathy, as well as muscle weakness in COVID-19, occurring with an increase in blood creatine kinase Copyright: ? 2021 Gultyaeva et al This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the License Agreement with Saint Petersburg State University, which permits to the authors unrestricted distribution, and self-archiving free of charge","output":"Damage of the muscle system in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To investigate the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly the prevalence, time of symptom onset, and duration of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.

METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% - -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% - 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas.

This paper selects Guangdong Province, China, for a case study. It utilizes big data on population migration and the geospatial analysis technique to develop a model to achieve spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 risk. The model takes into consideration the risk differential between the source cities of population migration as well as the heterogeneity in the socioeconomic characteristics of the destination cities of population migration. It further incorporates a time-lag process based on the time distribution of the onset of the imported cases. In theory, the model will be able to predict the evolutional trend and spatial distribution of the COVID-19 risk for a certain time period in the future and provide support for advanced planning and targeted prevention measures. The research findings indicate the following: (1) The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong Province reached a turning point on January 29, 2020, after which it showed a gradual decreasing trend. (2) Based on the time-lag analysis of the onset of the imported cases, it is common for a time interval to exist between case importation and illness onset, and the proportion of the cases with an interval of 1C14 days is relatively high. (3) There is evident spatial heterogeneity in the epidemic risk; the risk varies significantly between different areas based on their imported risk, susceptibility risk, and ability to prevent the spread. (4) The degree of connectedness and the scale of population migration between Guangdongs prefecture-level cities and their counterparts in the source regions of the epidemic, as well as the transportation and location factors of the cities in Guangdong, have a significant impact on the risk classification of the cities in Guangdong. The first-tier cities  Shenzhen and Guangzhou  are high-risk regions. The cities in the Pearl River Delta that are adjacent to Shenzhen and Guangzhou, including Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, are medium-risk cities. The eastern, northern, and western parts of Guangdong, which are outside of the metropolitan areas of the Pearl River Delta, are considered to have low risks.

However, in the context of recent advances in multidisciplinary respiratory management, the absolute indication for intubation in patients with CSCI based on initial neurologic assessment is controversial because of the drawbacks of intubation. This study aimed to redetermine the most important predictor of RE following CSCI after admission without routine intubation among patients admitted with motor-complete injury and/or injury above the C5 level to ensure timely intubation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with acute traumatic CSCI admitted to our hospital without an initial routine intubation protocol from January 2013 to December 2017. CSCI patients who developed RE (defined as unexpected emergent intubation for respiratory resuscitation) were compared with those who did not. Baseline characteristics and severity of trauma data were collected. Univariate analyses were performed to compare treatment data and clinical outcomes between the two groups. Further, multivariate logistic regression was performed with clinically important independent variables: motor-complete injury, neurologic level above C5, atelectasis, and copious airway secretion (CAS). RESULTS: Among 58 patients with CSCI, 35 (60.3%) required post-injury intubation and 1 (1.7%) died during hospitalization. Thirteen (22.4%) had RE 3.5 days (mean) post-injury; 3 (37.5%) of eight patients with motor-complete CSCI above C5 developed RE. Eleven of the 27 (40.7%) patients with motor-complete injury and five of the 22 (22.7%) patients with neurologic injury above C5 required emergency intubation at RE. Three of the eight CSCI patients with both risk factors (motor-complete injury above C5) resulted in emergent RE intubation (37.5%).

CONCLUSION: Timely intubation post-CSCI based on close attention to CAS during the acute 3-day phase may prevent RE and reduce unnecessary invasive airway control even without immediate routine intubation in motor-complete injury above C5.

There is an urgent need to design a suitable therapy or vaccine that could fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries.

MFGM contains lipids and glycoproteins as well as gangliosides, which may be involved in myelination processes. Notably, myelination and thereby white matter integrity are often altered in obesity. Furthermore, MFGM interventions showed beneficial effects in obesity by affecting inflammatory processes and the microbiome. In this study, we investigated the impact of a dietary MFGM intervention on fat storage, neuroinflammatory processes and myelination in a rodent model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. METHODS 12-week-old male low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient Leiden mice were exposed to a HFD, a HFD enriched with 3% whey protein lipid concentrate (WPC) high in MFGM components, or a low fat diet. The impact of MFGM supplementation during 24-weeks of HFD-feeding was examined over time by analyzing body weight and fat storage, assessing cognitive tasks and MRI scanning, analyzing myelinization with polarized light imaging and examining neuroinflammation using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS We found in this study that 24 weeks of HFD-feeding induced excessive fat storage, increased systolic blood pressure, altered white matter integrity, decreased functional connectivity, induced neuroinflammation and impaired spatial memory. Notably, supplementation with 3% WPC high in MFGM components restored HFD-induced neuroinflammation and attenuated the reduction in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and hippocampal functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS We showed that supplementation with WPC high in MFGM components beneficially contributed to hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, functional connectivity in the hippocampus and anti-inflammatory processes in HFD-induced obesity in rodents. Current knowledge regarding exact biological mechanisms underlying these effects should be addressed in future studies.","output":"Milk fat globule membrane attenuates high fat diet-induced neuropathological changes in obese Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During an epidemic, metrics such as R(0), doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the detected case number and trajectory of early detected cases differ considerably between states. We then test for correlations with testing protocols, interventions and population characteristics. We find that epidemic dynamics were most strongly associated with non-pharmaceutical government actions during the early phase of the epidemic. In particular, early social distancing restrictions, particularly on restaurant operations, was correlated with increased doubling times. Interestingly, we also found that states with little tolerance for deviance from enforced rules saw faster early epidemic growth. Together with other correlates such as population density, our results highlight the different factors involved in the heterogeneity in the early spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States.

This study investigated the association of eleven SNPs related to obesity with weight loss one year after Roux-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in female patients. METHODS This prospective study included 351 women with obesity. The genotypes for eleven SNPs (GHRL - rs26802; GHSR - rs572169; LEP - rs7799039; LEPR - rs1137101; 5HT2C - rs3813929; UCP2 - rs659366; UCP3 - rs1800849; SH2B1 - rs7498665; TAS1R2 - rs35874116; TAS1R2 - rs9701796; FTO - rs9939609) were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TaqMan assays. Anthropometric measurements were performed before and one year after RYGB surgery. To evaluate the factors that influenced the proportion of weight loss 1 year after surgery, beta regression analysis was used. The models were estimated using the SAS software GLIMMIX procedure. The level of significance adopted for the statistical tests was 5%. RESULTS The average percentage of total body weight loss in one year was 64.4  5.8% and the median was 65.0%. In assessing the proportion of weight loss in one year after surgery, using univariate analysis (beta regression), no single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influenced weight loss. And in the multiple analysis, with stepwise process of variable selection, no variable was significant to compose the multiple model. CONCLUSION The 11 SNPs investigated did not influence weight loss one year after RYGB surgery in female patients.

Evidence shows severe acute respiratory syndrome is closely related to the induced cytokine storm. Interleukin-6 is a key player; its role in systemic inflammation is well known. AIM: To evaluate the effect of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, on the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, MedRxiv, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 9(th) June 2020 for observational or prospective studies reporting results of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 infection treated with TCZ. Effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and an OR less than 1 was associated with a better outcome in those treated with TCZ. RESULTS: Overall 13476 patients (33 studies; n = 3264 received TCZ) with COVID-19 pneumonia and various degree of severity were included. Outcome was improved with TCZ. In the primary analysis (n = 19 studies reporting data), mortality was reduced in patients treated with TCZ (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.47-0.87; P < 0.01). In 9 studies where risk of death with TCZ use was controlled for other variables mortality was reduced by 57% (OR = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.27-0.7; P < 0.01). Intensive care need (mechanical ventilation) was also reduced (OR = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.14-0.89; P = 0.02).

Previous research demonstrates that for-profit nursing homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than non-profit homes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29-May 20, 2020 using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between nursing home profit status (for-profit, non-profit or municipal) and nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks, COVID-19 outbreak sizes, and COVID-19 resident deaths. Results: The analysis included all 623 Ontario nursing homes, of which 360 (57.7%) were for-profit, 162 (26.0%) were non-profit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) COVID-19 nursing home outbreaks involving 5218 residents (mean of 27.5 +/- 41.3 residents per home), resulting in 1452 deaths (mean of 7.6 +/- 12.7 residents per home) with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the health region surrounding a nursing home (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.09) and number of beds (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI 1.20-1.63), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the size of a nursing home outbreak (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (aRR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared to non-profit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older nursing home design standards in for-profit homes. Interpretation: For-profit status is associated with the size of a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for profit and non-profit homes are largely explained by older design standards, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","output":"For-profit nursing homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication contains the experience of two early-career organic professors at primarily undergraduate institutions during the rapid transition to an online learning environment during the COVID-19 pandemic The techniques and methods for transitioning both the organic lecture and lab of two class sizes (similar to 50 and similar to 10) are juxtaposed, and conclusions are drawn that provide insight into improvements for both online and on-site learning","output":"Maintaining an Active Organic Class during the COVID-Induced Online Transition at Two Undergraduate Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The current and alarming condition of Covid-19 pandemic may cause stress and anxiety in pregnant women.

If left untreated, anxiety is predictive of psychiatric disorders including depression and associated suicide risk. Despite the prevalence and impact of mens anxiety, it remains largely overlooked in the field of mens mental health. Globally, men are reported to have lower rates of anxiety disorders compared to women; however, these sex-differences do not reflect the complexity and nuance of mens experiences. There is early evidence to suggest a male-type anxiety phenotype which may go undetected with generic diagnostic classifications. Masculine norms (i.e., stoicism, toughness, invulnerability) appear to be central to mens experiences and expressions of anxiety as well as mens help-seeking and coping behaviours. This is particularly concerning given anxiety increases mens risk of physical and psychological comorbidities and suicide risk. The effective assessment, detection and treatment of mens anxiety is therefore critical to improve mental health outcomes across the male lifespan. We propose three key recommendations for the field of mens anxiety: (i) to develop a theoretical model surrounding mens experiences of anxiety, (ii) broaden mental health resources, interventions and suicide prevention strategies to encompass mens gendered experiences of anxiety (e.g., sentiments of shame, physical symptom manifestation), and (iii) utilise informal supports (i.e., friends and family) as an avenue of intervention to improve mens anxiety outcomes.

Therefore, we aimed at studying the role of BBS4 in neuronal development under normal and ER stress conditions. ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) were studied in BBS4-silenced (SiBBS4) SH-SY5Y cells during differentiation under normal and stress states, using molecular and biochemical markers. ER stress was demonstrated at early neural differentiation, with significantly augmented expression of UPR markers corresponding to BBS4 expression. In the undifferentiated state, BBS4 silencing resulted in significantly reduced ER-stress markers' expression under normal and ER-stress states. Independent of ER stress, SiBBS4 cells demonstrated significant reduction in activated phospho-IRE1. Under BBS4 silencing, both sXBP-1 and activated ATF6 p50 failed to translocate to the nucleus. Transcript levels of apoptosis markers were upregulated under BBS4 depletion and ER-stress induction, corresponding to decreased viability. BBS4 depletion in neuronal cells results in reduced sensitivity to ER stress during differentiation and under ER-stress induction, partly due to failure in translocation of ER-transcription factors (TF) sXBP-1 and ATF6 p50 to the nucleus. Hence, BBS4 is essential for nuclear transport under ER-stress response in neuronal cells during early differentiation.

Compared with metallic EES, risk of target lesion failure (9.6% vs. 7.2%; absolute risk difference: +2.4%; risk ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.59; number needed to harm: 41; p = 0.003; I2 = 0%) and stent thrombosis (2.4% vs. 0.7%; absolute risk difference: +1.7%; risk ratio: 3.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.87 to 5.30; number needed to harm: 60; p < 0.0001; I2 = 0%) were both significantly higher with BVS. There were no significant differences in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality between groups. The increased risk for ST associated with BVS was concordant across the early (<30 days), late (30 days to 1 year), and very late (>1 year) periods (pinteraction = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS Compared with metallic EES, the BVS appears to be associated with both lower efficacy and higher thrombotic risk over time.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare providers faced a number of challenges, including how to quickly adapt screening practices. The objective of this analyses was to learn staff perspectives on how the pandemic impacted suicide risk screening in primary care and mental health settings. Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary care and mental health staff between April-September 2020 across 12 VHA facilities. A multi-disciplinary team employed a qualitative thematic analysis using a hybrid inductive/deductive approach. Staff reported multiple concerns for patients during the crisis, especially regarding vulnerable populations at risk for social isolation. Lack of clear protocols at some sites on how to serve patients screening positive for suicidal ideation created confusion for staff and led some sites to temporarily stop screening. Sites had varying degrees of adaptability to virtual based care, with the biggest challenge being completion of warm hand-offs to mental health specialists.

Pathogenic IBV 3575/08 was isolated from broilers vaccinated with the attenuated viral vaccine derived from a Taiwan strain 2575/98. In this study, extensive investigations were conducted on the genome sequences, antigenicity, pathogenicity, and host immune responses of several IBV strains in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Sequence analyses revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 shared high homology in their structural genes, but not in non-structural accessory proteins such as 3a, 3b and 5b. Despite a high degree of homology in their spike protein genes, cross neutralization test showed low cross protection between 3575/08 and 2575/98, suggesting distinct antigenicity for the two strains. Animal challenge experiments exhibited strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity for 3575/08. In addition, early and prolonged viral shedding and rapid viral dissemination were observed. Immune gene expression profiling by PCR array showed chickens infected with 3575/08 had delayed expression of a subset of early innate immune genes, whereas chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuated-type 2575/08 revealed quick gene induction and efficient virus control.

We assessed duration of protection of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines after second dose and after third/booster dose against symptomatic Omicron infection and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death, between December 23, 2021 and February 2, 2022. METHODS: Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using the test-negative, case-control study design, applying the same methodology used earlier to assess waning of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 effectiveness in the same population during earlier infection waves. RESULTS: BNT162b2 effectiveness against symptomatic Omicron infection was highest at 61.9% (95% CI: 49.9-71.1%) in the first month after the second dose, but then gradually declined and was at 10% or less starting from the 5th month after the second dose. After the booster, effectiveness rapidly rebounded to peak at about 55% between 2-5 weeks after the booster, but then started to decline again thereafter. Effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was maintained at >70% after the second dose and at >90% after the booster with no evidence for declining effectiveness over time. mRNA-1273 effectiveness against symptomatic Omicron infection was highest at 44.8% (95% CI: 16.0-63.8%) in the first three months after the second dose, before gradually declining to negligible levels thereafter. After the booster, effectiveness rapidly rebounded to peak at about 55% between 2-5 weeks after the booster, but then declined again thereafter. Effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was high at >60% after the second dose and at >80% after the booster, but the confidence intervals were wide owing to the small number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines show a similar level and pattern of protection against symptomatic Omicron infection. Protection against Omicron is lower than that against Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants, and wanes more rapidly than against earlier variants after the second and booster doses.

Trauma-focused treatments, such as Prolonged Exposure, result in clinically significant symptom relief for many. Adherence to these treatments (i.e., session attendance and homework compliance) is vital to ensuring recovery but can be challenging for patients. Engaging families in veterans treatment could prove to be an effective strategy for promoting treatment adherence while also addressing long-standing calls for better family inclusion in treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. This paper describes the methods of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate if family inclusion in Prolonged Exposure can improve treatment adherence. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six veterans, with clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, will be randomized to receive either standard Prolonged Exposure or Prolonged Exposure enhanced through family inclusion (Family-Supported Prolonged Exposure) across three different VA facilities. Our primary outcomes are session attendance and homework compliance. Secondary outcomes include posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity, depression, quality of life, and relationship functioning. The study includes a concurrent process evaluation to identify potential implementation facilitators and barriers to family involvement in Prolonged Exposure within VA.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that Twitter discourse on two epidemics (firearm injury and COVID-19) would differ between tweets with health care-initiated hashtags (#ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE) versus those with non-health care-initiated hashtags (#GunViolence and #COVID19). METHODS: Using natural language processing, we compared content, affect, and authorship of a random 1% of tweets using #ThisIsOurLane (Nov 2018-Oct 2019) and #GetUsPPE (March-May 2020), compared to #GunViolence and #COVID19 tweets, respectively. We extracted the relative frequency of single words and phrases and created two sets of features: (1) an open-vocabulary feature set to create 50 data-driven-determined word clusters to evaluate the content of tweets; and (2) a closed-vocabulary feature for psycholinguistic categorization among case and comparator tweets. In accordance with conventional linguistic analysis, we used a P<.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, to identify potentially meaningful correlations between language features and outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 67% (n=4828) ofa?#ThisIsOurLane tweets and 36.6% (n=7907) of #GetUsPPE tweets were authored by health care professionals, compared to 16% (n=1152) of #GunViolence and 9.8% (n=2117) of #COVID19 tweets.

Symptomatic children, when compared to asymptomatic children, had higher viral loads (mean cycle threshold on day 7 of illness 28.6 vs. 36.7, P = 0.02). Peak SARS-CoV-2 viral loads occurred around day 2 of illness in infected children. Although we were unable to directly demonstrate infectivity, the detection of significant amount of virus in the upper airway of asymptomatic children suggest that they have the potential to shed and transmit SARS-CoV-2. Our study highlights the importance of contact tracing and screening for SARS-CoV-2 in children with epidemiological risk factors regardless of their symptom status, in order to improve containment of the virus in the community, including educational settings.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load dynamics in the nasopharynx of infected children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become one of the most serious global epidemics in the 21st Century.

The present study sought to incorporate broad stakeholder engagement as part of the first phase of development of a new Integrated Model for Supervision (IMS) for use within MHPSS and protection services in humanitarian emergencies. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 global mental health professionals. Data was analysed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive methods. Codes and themes were validated through co-author cross-checks and through a webinar with an expert advisory group. RESULTS: Results reinforce the importance of effective supervision to enhance the quality of interventions and to protect supervisees wellbeing. Participants generally agreed that regular, supportive supervision on a one-to-one basis and as a separate system from line management, is the ideal format. The interviews highlight a need for guidance in specific areas, such as monitoring and evaluation, and navigating power imbalances in the supervisory relationship. Several approaches to supervision were described, including some solutions for use in low-resource situations, such as group, peer-to-peer or remote supervision. CONCLUSION: An integrated model for supervision (IMS) should offer a unified framework encompassing a definition of supervision, consolidation of best practice, and goals and guidance for the supervisory process.","output":"Towards an integrated model for supervision for mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian emergencies: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed.

However, SARS-CoV-2 medications that are specific and effective are still being developed. Honokiol is a bioactive component from Magnoliae officinalis Cortex with damp-drying effect. To develop new potent antiviral molecules, a series of novel honokiol analogues were synthesized by introducing various 3-((5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)methyl)oxazol-2(3H)-ones to its molecule. In a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus model, all honokiol derivatives were examined for their antiviral entry activities. As a result, 6a and 6p demonstrated antiviral entry effect with IC(50) values of 29.23 and 9.82 M, respectively. However, the parental honokiol had a very weak antiviral activity with an IC(50) value more than 50 M. A biolayer interfero-metry (BLI) binding assay and molecular docking study revealed that 6p binds to human ACE2 protein with higher binding affinity and lower binding energy than the parental honokiol. A competitive ELISA assay confirmed the inhibitory effect of 6p on SARS-CoV-2 spike RBDs binding with ACE2. Importantly, 6a and 6p (TC(50) > 100 M) also had higher biological safety for host cells than honokiol (TC(50) of 48.23 M).

A unimolar one-step lauroylation of thymidine under controlled conditions furnished the 5?-O-(lauroyl) thymidine and indicated the selectivity at C-5? position and the development of thymidine based potential antimicrobial analogs, which were further converted into four newer 3?-O-(acyl)-5?-O-(lauroyl) thymidine analogs in reasonably good yields. The chemical structures of the newly synthesised analogs were ascertained by analysing their physicochemical, elemental, and spectroscopic data. In vitro antimicrobial tests against five bacteria and two fungi, along with the prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS), indicated promising antibacterial functionality for these thymidine analogs compared to antifungal activity. In support of this observation, molecular docking experiments have been performed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and significant binding affinities and non-bonding interactions were observed against the main protease (6LU7, 6Y84 and 7BQY), considering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as standard. Moreover, the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation process was performed to monitor the behaviour of the complex structure formed by the main protease under in silico physiological conditions to examine its stability over time, and this revealed a stable conformation and binding pattern in a stimulating environment of thymidine analogs. Cytotoxicity determination confirmed that compounds were found less toxic. Pharmacokinetic predictions were investigated to evaluate their absorption, distribution, metabolism and toxic properties, and the combination of pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness predictions has shown promising results in silico.

Chest CT severity score (CT-SS) could be considered as an appropriate prognostic factor for mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis evaluating the prognostic accuracy of CT-SS for mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases between December 2019 and September 2021. The meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model, and sensitivity and specificity (with 95%CIs) of CT-SS were calculated using the study authors pre-specified threshold. RESULTS: Sensitivity estimates ranged from 0.32 to 1.00, and the pooled estimate of sensitivity was 0.67 [95%CI (0.59C0.75)]. Specificity estimates ranged from 0.53 to 0.95 and the pooled estimate of specificity was 0.79 [95%CI (0.74C0.84)]. Results of meta-regression analysis showed that radiologist experiences did not affect the sensitivity and specificity of CT-SS to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients (P = 0.314 and 0.283, respectively). The test for subgroup differences suggests that study location significantly modifies sensitivity and specificity of CT-SS to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Service utilisation has declined, and excess cardiovascular mortality has been reported in several countries. We aim to estimate excess cardiovascular deaths in Chile during 2020. METHODS: We collected mortality data from the Chilean Department of Statistics and Health Information and refined them using the maps of Global Burden of Disease Studies in 2017 and 2010. We conducted a time series analysis using quasi-Poisson distribution to predict cardiovascular mortality in 2020 and compared it with observed numbers and calculated attributable fractions (AFs) with 95% uncertainty intervals, as a whole and by sex, age group and type of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: During 2015C2020, 173 283 cardiovascular deaths were recorded, with 28 141 deaths in 2020. The observation in 2020 was lower than our projection in the overall data (?4.0% (?5.0% to ?2.8%)) and in male (?11.7% (?13% to ?10.3%)). However, positive AFs were noted among female (5.0% (3.2% to 6.8%)), people in age group 80C89 years (11.0% (8.6% to 13.5%)) and people who died from hypertensive heart diseases (18.9% (14.7% to 23.5%)). CONCLUSIONS: Less overall cardiovascular deaths were observed in 2020 compared with our projection, possibly associated with competing risks from COVID-19 infection in men.

With virtually every individual worldwide being impacted, strategies are needed to devise best vaccine distribution scenarios, ensuring proper storage, transportation and cost considerations. Current models do not consider the magnitude of distribution efforts needed in our current pandemic, in particular the objective that entire populations need to be vaccinated. We expand on existing models and devise an approach that considers the needed extensive distribution capabilities and special storage requirements of vaccines, while at the same time being cognizant of costs. As such, we provide decision support on how to distribute the vaccine to an entire population based on priority. We do so by conducting predictive analysis for three different scenarios and dividing the distribution chain into three phases. As the available vaccine doses are limited in quantity at first, we apply decision tree analysis to find the best vaccination scenario, followed by a synthetic control analysis to predict the impact of the vaccination programme to forecast future vaccine production. We then formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for locating and allocating cold storage facilities for bulk vaccine production, followed by the proposition of a heuristic algorithm to solve the associated objective functions.

The objective of this study was to examine the experiences of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) working with SDMs who vetoed a deceased donors consent for organ donation. METHODS: Qualitative focus groups were conducted with ten OTDCs in Ontario, Canada who reported experience with family veto. An interpretative phenomenological approach informed data analysis. Themes emerged through team consensus and were further refined through collaborative and reflexive engagement. RESULTS: Four themes emerged regarding family veto: 1) the significance of the OTDC role, 2) emotional distress and the understandable family veto, 3) barriers contributing to family veto, and 4) strategies towards a culture of organ donation. Findings highlighted the importance of patient advocacy in the OTDC role, while revealing the emotional distress of experiencing family veto. OTDCs identified timing and healthcare providers perceived ambivalence toward organ donation as critical barriers to family authorization. Value-positive language, role reframing, and increased education were offered as strategies to address these barriers and reduce family veto.

METHODS In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3002 patients to receive either fondaparinux, administered subcutaneously at a dose of 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo for 45 days. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death from any cause or symptomatic pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, or symptomatic extension to the saphenofemoral junction or symptomatic recurrence of superficial-vein thrombosis at day 47. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. The patients were followed until day 77. RESULTS The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 13 of 1502 patients (0.9%) in the fondaparinux group and 88 of 1500 patients (5.9%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction with fondaparinux, 85%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to 92; P<0.001). The incidence of each component of the primary efficacy outcome was significantly reduced in the fondaparinux group as compared with the placebo group, except for the outcome of death (0.1% in both groups). The rate of pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis was 85% lower in the fondaparinux group than in the placebo group (0.2% vs. 1.3%; 95% CI, 50 to 95; P<0.001). Similar risk reductions were observed at day 77. A total of 88 patients would need to be treated to prevent one instance of pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis.

It encompasses the role of mechanical stimuli for developmental, morphological characteristics, and biological processes in different organs; the response of cells to mechanically induced force is now also emerging as a major determinant of disease. Due to fluid shear stress caused by blood flowing tangentially across the lumen surface, cells of the cardiovascular system are typically exposed to a variety of mechanotransduction. In the body, tissues are continuously exposed to physical forces ranging from compression to strain, which is caused by fluid pressure and compressive forces. Only lately, though, has the importance of how forces shape stem cell differentiation into lineage-committed cells and how mechanical forces can cause or exacerbate disease besides organizing cells into tissues been acknowledged. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are potent mediators of cardiac repair which can secret a large array of soluble factors that have been shown to play a huge role in tissue repair. Differentiation of MSCs is required to regulate mechanical factors such as fluid shear stress, mechanical strain, and the rigidity of the extracellular matrix through various signaling pathways for their use in regenerative medicine. In the present review, we highlighted mechanical influences on the differentiation of MSCs and the general factors involved in MSCs differentiation. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the progress that has been achieved in understanding how MSCs perceive and react to their mechanical environment, as well as to highlight areas where more research has been performed in previous studies to fill in the gaps.","output":"Mechanotransduction in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) Differentiation: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, responsible for millions of deaths globally.

Therefore, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 causes widespread tissue damage and the development of targeted pharmacological treatments will be critical in fighting this virus and preparing for future outbreaks. Herein, we summarize the progress made thus far by using in vitro or in vivo models to investigate individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their pathogenic mechanisms. We have grouped the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into three categories: host entry, self-acting, and host interacting. This review focuses on the self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins and summarizes current knowledge on how these proteins promote virus replication and disrupt host systems, as well as drugs that target the virus and virus interacting host proteins. Encouragingly, many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Future coronavirus outbreaks will most likely be caused by new virus strains that evade vaccine protection through mutations in entry proteins.

Here, mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses was compared during colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus; 7 and 7 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p=0.003), majoritarily as a consequence of a decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths.

We examined self-reported changes in solo and sexual behaviors in U.S. adults during early stages of the public health response to COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (N=1010; aged 18-94 years; 62% response rate) from April 10-20, 2020. We used weighted multinomial logistic regression to examine past month self-reported changes (decreased, stable or increased) in ten solo and partnered sexual behaviors. Predictor variables included: having children at home, past month depressive symptoms, (ACHA 3-item scale), past month loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), COVID-19 protection behaviors (adapted 12-item scale), perceived COVID-19 consequences (adapted 10-item scale) and COVID-19 knowledge (adapted 10-item scale). Findings: Nearly half of all adults reported some kind of change, most commonly, a decrease, in their sexual behavior in the past month. Having elementary aged children at home, past month depressive symptoms and loneliness and enacting more COVID-19 protective behaviors were associated with both reduced partnered bonding behaviors, such as hugging, cuddling, holding hands and kissing, as well as reduced partnered sexual behaviors, such as oral sex, partnered genital touching and vaginal sex. Greater COVID19 risk perception and greater COVID19 knowledge were associated with mixed effects in behavior outcomes. Interpretations: Our data illustrate the very personal ways in which different pandemic-associated factors may create or inhibit opportunities for solo and partnered sex. The centrality of sexuality to health and well-being, even during pandemics, means that a critical piece of public health prevention and management responses should is ensuring that services and resource that support positive sexual decision making remain open and available.","output":"Changes in Solo and Partnered Sexual Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a U.S. Probability Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted virus infecting ~390 million people worldwide. In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of na?ve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of na?ve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.","output":"Live Cell Analysis and Mathematical Modeling Identify Determinants of Attenuation of Dengue Virus 2-O-Methylation Mutant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses a recent survey of generation sector investors and the associated drivers of the decline in the volume of new-entrant generation, and on generators weighted-average costs of capital (WACC) and hurdle rates.

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 g of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC). CLINICAL DISCUSSION: When spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized. CONCLUSION: In situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A case report of arthroscopic surgery under extended spinal anesthesia for 402 minutes, assisted by monitored anesthesia care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has three major lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3(1).

Both HIV and COVID\\\\19 have been politicized and influenced by evolving recommendations from scientists, clinicians, policymakers and politically motivated organizations. While vaccines are vital for ending both pandemics, their impact will depend on availability and uptake. Four decades of experience with the HIV epidemic have shown that information alone is insufficient to overcome these challenges; interventions must address the underlying, often complex factors that influence human behaviour. This article builds from socio\\\\behavioural science theory and describes practical and successful approaches to enable and support adherence to prevention and treatment strategies, including vaccine adoption. Key methods include reframing tools to enhance motivation, promoting centralized sources of trusted information, strategic development and messaging with and within key populations (e.g. through social media) and appealing to self\\\\empowerment, altruism and informed decision making. Orchestrated evidence\\\\based activism is needed to overcome manipulative politicization, while consistent transparent messaging around scientific discoveries and clinical recommendations are critical for public acceptance and support. Ultimately, the effectiveness of COVID\\\\19 vaccines will depend on our ability to engender trust in the communities most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Many lessons learned from socio\\\\behavioural science in the HIV pandemic are applicable to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Individual behaviour must be understood within its interpersonal and societal context to address the current barriers to adherence to disease\\\\mitigating strategies and promote an effective response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, which is likely to be endured for the foreseeable future.","output":"Individual health behaviours to combat the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: lessons from HIV socio\\\\behavioural science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and AimsPregnancy provides a critical opportunity to engage women with substance use disorder in care. Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is associated with improved pregnancy and fetal outcomes, but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple barriers to accessing buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy. Care disruptions during the pandemic may have further exacerbated these already existing barriers. To quantify these changes, we examined trends in the number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe estimated an interrupted time series model using linked national pharmacy claims and medical claims data from May 2019 to December 2020. We estimated changes in the level and trend in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then stratified our analyses by payer. ResultsWe identified 2,947 pregnant patients filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. Before the pandemic, there was positive growth in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone (4.83% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.40% to 6.26%). During the pandemic, the monthly growth rate in individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone declined for both patients on commercial insurance and patients on Medicaid (all payers: -5.53% (95% CI: -7.28% to -3.78%); Medicaid: -7.66% (95% CI: -10.42% to -4.90%); Commercial: -3.59% (95% CI: -5.53% to -1.66%)). ConclusionThe number of pregnant individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions was increasing prior to the pandemic, but this growth has been lost during the pandemic.","output":"Decline in prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone fills during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post-crisis, policy-makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re-establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery.","output":"Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are crucial cause of death and hospitalization all over the world including India. The CVDs including the coronary artery disease (CAD) are developed by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Hyperlipidemia is a traditional risk factor for CVD. The aim of this study was to study the clinical corrections of Lipid Profiles with the Age and Gender in the Coronary Artery Disease Patients: Methods: In this study, we have investigated the effect of age and sex on in lipid profile in 3878 (1171 females and 2707 males) CAD patients from India. RESULTS The plasma TG was higher in males than in females regardless of the age. Results showed that CAD female patients had significantly increased HDL-C than their aged matched males. Moreover, the plasma TC and LDL-C were significantly higher in males than females until age 40 years. Then after the age of 40 years, TC and LDL-C become significantly higher in females than in males. In addition, we found that more than 85% of CAD cases were <55 years old, and about 30% of CAD cases had normal lipid profile. CONCLUSION We conclude that elderly females are at a greater risk for CAD than males. Moreover, there were no significant differences in CVDs causes between nonelderly and elderly females. In addition, a higher percentage of cases were premature CAD, and 30% of CAD may be caused by loci that are not related to lipid metabolism.","output":"Clinical correlations of Lipid Profiles with the Age and Gender in the Coronary Artery Disease Patients: A study of 3878 CAD patients from India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent developments in methods to study virus internalisation are providing clearer insights into mechanisms used by viruses to enter host cells.

Our goal is to describe our institution's surgical experience with management of bowel ischemia due to COVID-19 infection over a one-year period. METHODS: All patients admitted to our institution between March 2020 and March 2021 for treatment of COVID-19 infection and who underwent exploratory laparotomy with intra-operative confirmation of bowel ischemia were included. Data from the medical records were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. Eighty percent had a new or increasing vasopressor requirement, 70% had abdominal distension, and 50% had increased gastric residuals. Intra-operatively, ischemia affected the large bowel in 80% of cases, the small bowel in 60%, and both in 40%. Sixty five percent had an initial damage control laparotomy. Most of the resected bowel specimens had a characteristic appearance at the time of surgery, with a yellow discoloration, small areas of antimesenteric necrosis, and very sharp borders. Histologically, the bowel specimens frequently have fibrin thrombi in the small submucosal and mucosal blood vessels in areas of mucosal necrosis. Overall mortality in this cohort was 33%. Forty percent of patients had a thromboembolic complication overall with 88% of these developing a thromboembolic phenomenon despite being on prophylactic pre-operative anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Bowel ischemia is a potentially lethal complication of COVID-19 infection with typical gross and histologic characteristics.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate these emissions within the boundary layer and at higher heights utilizing satellite data that are more inclusionary, where limited in situ observations are available. Here, we utilize the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), Ozone Monitoring Instruments (OMI), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2) hyperspectral satellite data to assess the changes in emission sources during Indian lockdown with a primary focus on the tropospheric profiles of ozone and carbon monoxide (CO). A significant reduction (> 20%) in the tropospheric ozone was seen over northern and northeast regions compared to 2018, while a dramatic increase (> 20%) compared to 2019 was seen. The subtropical dynamics mainly contributed to the increased ozone over the northern region. An analysis of the ozone production regime showed mostly NO(2) limited regime over the major part of India and VOC limited regime over thermal power plants regions. Unlike in the boundary layer, where CO showed reduction (15C20%), CO profiles showed a consistent increase (as high as 31%) in the free troposphere over the majority of cities and thermal power plants. The CO total column also showed an increase (~ 20%) over central and western India and a slight decrease (5%) over northern India. Similar to CO, an increase (~ 15%) of NO(2) column over the western region was observed particularly compared to 2019. However, unlike ozone and CO, reduction of tropospheric NO(2) columns was seen over the major part of India, with the highest reduction over northern regions (20C52%). Furthermore, homogeneous yearly differences (> 30%) between OMI and TROPOMI NO(2) observations were also seen distinctly over the remote areas. Contrary to surface-based studies, the present study shows an increase in CO, ozone (decrease), and NO(2) at several locations and in the free troposphere during the lockdown.

Adherence to preventive behaviors could be determined by individuals' health beliefs, which would be influenced by antecedent factors such as previous exposure to pandemic stressors. Applying the health belief model (HBM), this study aims to examine the mediation association among COVID-19 stressors, HBM constructs, and preventive behaviors. Longitudinal data were collected from 1225 Chinese college students using web-based surveys at wave 1 (w1; between January 31 and February 11, 2020) and wave 2 (w2; between March 20 and April 3, 2020). Participants reported their COVID-19 stressors (w1), five HBM constructs (w2), and preventive behaviors (w1 and w2). Paired t-tests suggested that social distancing and self-quarantine behaviors decreased while precautionary behaviors increased from w1 to w2. Path analysis indicated that two HBM constructs (perceived barriers and self-efficacy) mediated the association between COVID-19 stressors and precautionary behaviors. These findings suggested that tailored prevention intervention for college students should attend to perceived barriers and self-efficacy. Individuals who exposed to multiple pandemic stressors merit particular attention and intervention should account for their early pandemic stress experiences.","output":"Adherence to preventive behaviors among college students during COVID-19 pandemic in China: The role of health beliefs and COVID-19 stressors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a powerful innovative gene amplification technique emerging as a simple rapid diagnostic tool for early detection and identification of microbial diseases.

Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real\\\\time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real\\\\time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

We then performed thematic analyses to identify and catalogue critical domains related to surgeons' education about opioid prescribing. SETTING Tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Maximum variation purposive sampling was used to recruit general surgery residents and surgical faculty members. RESULTS We interviewed 21 attending surgeons and 20 surgical residents. Surgeons reported minimal formal training on pain management and prescribing opioids. A minority of individuals described receiving opioid training in the form of continuing medical education, intern boot camp sessions, and medical school classes. Participants compensated for the lack of formal training during residency by informally learning from senior residents, consulting pain specialists, and seeking external learning resources. Increased surgical experience was correlated with increased comfort with pain management. A majority of surgeons desired formal training. The most commonly requested educational resources were opioid prescribing guidelines for common operations and recommendations for treating chronic pain patients. Residents requested that training occur early in residency to maximize the benefits received. Based on these findings, we developed a conceptual framework to explain how surgeons learn to prescribe opioids and to highlight opportunities for improvement.

It extended to over 180 nations around the world. It can manifest in patients who are asymptomatic to those who are symptomatic, with symptoms ranging from anosmia to severe respiratory distress syndrome. It affects both men and women. The existence of comorbidity is also linked to a significant worsening of the infection. Despite the fact that the principal consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) damage the lungs, the prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 hospitalized patients has repeatedly been observed to be lower than the prevalence of smokers in the general community. As a result, the evidence from various studies appears to cast doubt on active smoking as a risk factor for COVID-19 pneumonia. Thus, with this background, this study has been conducted with the aim of assessing the influence of smoking as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Methodology An observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center in Tamil Nadu for a period of three months (April 2021 to June 2021). The study participants were all the patients admitted to the COVID-19 ward of the department of general medicine during the study period. Those who were not willing to participate in the study were excluded. The questionnaire contains variables including socio-demographic characteristics, vitals, and investigations, and the outcome variable was death due to COVID-19. The data obtained were entered in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and the results were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results About 401 individuals participated in the study. The mean age, COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) score, and CT severity score of the study participants were 50 years, 4.91, and 10.61, respectively. About 63.3% of participants were males, about 92% have not been vaccinated, about 91.8% have a CO-RADS score of 5, about 45.1% were smokers, and about 15.7% have died despite effective treatment. When looking for adverse outcomes, being male (p = 0.047), non-vaccinated for COVID-19 (p = 0.042), and being a smoker (p = 0.008) were the factors that showed statistical significance. Conclusion The mortality due to COVID-19 is high among smokers than non-smokers with statistical significance. Thus, before admitting COVID-19 patients, to classify the patients as mild, moderate, and severe, the risk factor of the habit of smoking can be added. Cigarette smoke is harmful to the lungs in a variety of ways, and further research is needed to understand why there is such a low proportion of current smokers among COVID-19 patients in hospitals. The impact of current smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection is a delicate and complex topic that should be thoroughly investigated before sending out potentially misunderstood signals.","output":"An Analytical Study to Determine the Severity of COVID-19 Among Smokers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increase in the availability of metagenomic data generated by next generation sequencing, there is an urgent need for fast and accurate tools for identifying viruses in host-associated and environmental samples.

Neurofilament proteins (NfPs) are well suited as biomarkers in these contexts because they are major neuron-specific components that maintain structural integrity and are sensitive to neurodegeneration and neuronal injury across a wide range of neurologic diseases. Low levels of NfPs are constantly released from neurons into the extracellular space and ultimately reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood under physiological conditions throughout normal brain development, maturation, and aging. NfP levels in CSF and blood rise above normal in response to neuronal injury and neurodegeneration independently of cause. NfPs in CSF measured by lumbar puncture are about 40-fold more concentrated than in blood in healthy individuals. New ultra-sensitive methods now allow minimally invasive measurement of these low levels of NfPs in serum or plasma to track disease onset and progression in neurological disorders or nervous system injury and assess responses to therapeutic interventions. Any of the five Nf subunits C neurofilament light chain (NfL), neurofilament medium chain (NfM), neurofilament heavy chain (NfH), alpha-internexin (INA) and peripherin (PRPH) may be altered in a given neuropathological condition. In familial and sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD), plasma NfL levels may rise as early as 22 years before clinical onset in familial AD and 10 years before sporadic AD. The major determinants of elevated levels of NfPs and degradation fragments in CSF and blood are the magnitude of damaged or degenerating axons of fiber tracks, the affected axon caliber sizes and the rate of release of NfP and fragments at different stages of a given neurological disease or condition directly or indirectly affecting central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral nervous system (PNS). NfPs are rapidly emerging as transformative blood biomarkers in neurology providing novel insights into a wide range of neurological diseases and advancing clinical trials. Here we summarize the current understanding of intracellular NfP physiology, pathophysiology and extracellular kinetics of NfPs in biofluids and review the value and limitations of NfPs and degradation fragments as biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuronal injury.","output":"Neurofilament Proteins as Biomarkers to Monitor Neurological Diseases and the Efficacy of Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: este trabajo estudia los efectos del confinamiento total en las familias espa?olas debido a la COVID-19 sobre el tiempo dedicado al juego y las tareas escolares, el asesoramiento de la escuela a las familias y las prioridades de las familias respecto al juego, las tareas escolares y las actividades extraescolares.

The goal of this study was to retroactively apply the CHEER system to all prior existing reports of endoscopic resection of primary benign orbital tumors (BOTs) to: (1) compare patient presentations, perioperative characteristics, and outcomes between OCH and other BOTs; and (2) determine whether the CHEER categorization regime could be expanded to other BOTs. METHODS A systematic review of studies reporting exclusively endoscopic resections of OCH and other BOTs (eg, solitary fibrous tumor, schwannoma, and meningioma) was performed. Patient, tumor characteristics, and operative outcomes were recorded. All tumors with adequate reporting were retrospectively assigned a CHEER stage. Outcomes were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS Ninety-three studies met inclusion criteria, and sufficient data were available in 36 studies, comprising 105 tumors (n = 87 OCHs; n = 18 other BOTs). Baseline patient and tumor characteristics, as well as intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes were not significantly different between OCHs and other BOTs. Long-term outcomes (eg, visual deficits, diplopia, eye position, and recurrence) also did not differ when controlling for CHEER stage. CONCLUSION This review represents the largest collection of outcomes data following exclusively endoscopic endonasal resection of BOTs. Short-term and long-term outcomes appear similar between OCHs and other BOTs. These results suggest that exclusively endoscopic resection of orbital tumors may be effective in a range of benign pathologies. Furthermore, these results support a broader application of the CHEER system to other benign primary orbital tumors.","output":"Exclusively endoscopic endonasal resection of benign orbital tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Interest has been shown in the use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Information was retrieved on the proportion of users (prevalence), doses (measured in ) aprescriptions. RESULTS Total sales of systemic antibiotics increased in March 2020, but sales to persons outside of healthcare institutions did not. Compared to previous years, both total consumption and use of antibiotics outside of institutions fell steeply in the months that followed. The reduction was greatest for antibiotics against respiratory infections and in the youngest age groups. INTERPRETATION The significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributed to infection control measures and reduced contact with the health service.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology, treatment pathways and 30-day mortality rates of hip fractures. Outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients were compared against those who tested negative. METHODS: An observational, retrospective, multicentre study was conducted across six hospitals in the South East of England. Data were retrieved from the National Hip Fracture Database and electronic medical records. Data was collected for the strictest UK lockdown period (period B=23 March 2020-11 May 2020), and the corresponding period in 2019 (period A). RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were admitted during period A, whereas 381 were admitted during period B. Despite the suspension of the 'Best Practice Tariff' during period B, time to surgery, time to orthogeriatric assessment, and 30-day mortality were similar between period A and B. The length of inpatient stay was significantly shorter during period B (11.5 days vs 17.0 days, p<0.001). Comparison of COVID-19 positive and negative patients during period B demonstrated that a positive test was associated with a significantly higher rate of 30-day mortality (53.6% vs 6.7%), surgical delay >36h (46.4% vs 30.8%, p=0.049), and increased length of inpatient stay (15.8 vs 11.7 days, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown did not alter the epidemiology of hip fractures. A substantially higher mortality rate was observed among patients with a COVID-19 positive test.

Several assays have been developed and are in use in todays clinical practice. These assays vary in their analytical and clinical performance. For an accurate diagnosis, medical professionals must become more familiar with the tests utility to select the most appropriate test. This study aims to evaluate the analytical performance of rapid antigen tests used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen compared to RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. METHODS: Oropharyngeal swab specimens from five COVID-19 patients were tested by seven rapid antigen tests developed by different IVD companies. RT-PCR to detect specific RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 was used as a confirmatory test. The cycle threshold (Ct) value, which often reflects viral load, in these specimens ranged from 15 to 35. For the analytical evaluation, extraction fluid of each antigen kit was spiked with attenuated ATCC virus at different concentrations ranging from 4.6x10(4)/mL to 7.5x10(5)/mL and tested with antigen testing kits. RESULTS: Out of five confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens by RT-PCR, only one sample showed a positive result by one of the seven evaluated antigen testing kits. The positive result was observed in the specimen with a Ct value of 15. All other evaluated rapid tests were negative for all five positive specimens. This was further confirmed with the spiking study using ATCC attenuated virus, where extraction fluid of each rapid test was spiked with concentrations ranging from 4.6x10(4)/mL to 7.5x10(5)/mL. None of these spiked specimens showed positive results, indicating very low sensitivity of these antigen kits. CONCLUSION: This comparison study shows that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR tests and are not reliable tests for testing asymptomatic patients, who often carry low viral load.

We aimed to estimate the implementation of this recommendation using data from the general population in Germany. Design Cross-sectional analysis of data (2021/2022) of a nationally representative household survey. Setting Population of Germany. Participants Representative sample of 2,247 adult respondents (>18 years) who reported hazardous or harmful drinking according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C; score females: 4-12, males: 5-12). Main outcome measure Ever receipt of ''brief GP advice on, or support with, reducing alcohol consumption''. Differences in the likelihood of ever receiving advice and/or support (yes/no) relative to respondents' sociodemographic, smoking, and alcohol consumption characteristics were estimated using logistic regressions. Results Ever receipt of GP advice on/support with reducing alcohol was reported among 6.3% (95%CI=5.3%-7.4%), and the offer of support among 1.5% (95%CI=1.1%-2.1%) of the hazardous and harmful drinking respondents. The likelihood of having ever received advice/support was positively associated with being older (odds ratio (OR)=1.03 per year, 95%CI=1.01-1.04), a current or former (versus never) smoker (OR=2.36, 95%CI=1.46-3.80; OR=2.17, 95%CI=1.23-3.81), and with increasing alcohol consumption (OR=1.76 per score, 95%CI=1.59-1.95).

The COVID\\\\19 pandemic is a global health crisis, and no specific therapy or drug has been formally recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, it is a rational strategy to investigate the repurposing of existing drugs to use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the meantime, the medical community is trialing several therapies that target various antiviral and immunomodulating mechanisms to use against the infection. There is no doubt that antiviral and supportive treatments are important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but anti-inflammatory therapy also plays a pivotal role in the management COVID-19 patients due to its ability to prevent further injury and organ damage or failure. In this review, we identified drugs that could modulate cytokines levels and play a part in the management of COVID-19. Several drugs that possess an anti-inflammatory profile in others illnesses have been studied in respect of their potential utility in the treatment of the hyperinflammation induced by SAR-COV-2 infection. We highlight a number of antivirals, anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and antiparasitic drugs that have been found to mitigate cytokine production and consequently attenuate the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2. Reduced hyperinflammation can attenuate multiple organ failure, and even reduce the mortality associated with severe COVID-19.

Thus, we aimed to assess misclassification rates between clinical vs. pathological PCa burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared senior patients with PCa 75 y (n = 847), who were propensity score matched with younger patients <75 y (n = 3,388) in a 1:4 ratio. Matching was based on the number of biopsy cores, prostate volume, and preoperative Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risk groups score. Multivariable logistic regression models (LRMs) predicted surgical CAPRA (CAPRA-S) upgrade, which was defined as a higher risk of the CAPRA-S in the presence of lower-risk preoperative CAPRA score. LRM incorporated the same variables as propensity score matching. Moreover, patients were categorized as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk, preoperative and according to their CAPRA and CAPRA-S scores. RESULTS: Surgical CAPRA risk strata significantly differed between the groups. Greater proportions of unfavorable intermediate risk (39 vs. 32%) or high risk (30 vs. 28%; p < 0.001) were observed. These proportions are driven by greater proportions of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Gleason Grade Group 4 or 5 (33 vs. 26%; p = 0.001) and pathological tumor stage (T3a 54 vs. 45%; p < 0.001). Increasing age was identified as an independent predictor of CAPRA-S-based upgrade (age odds ratio [OR] 1.028 95% CI 1.02C1.037; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Approximately every second senior patient has a misclassification in (i.e., any up or downgrade) and each 4.5th senior patient specifically has an upgrade in his final pathology that directly translates to an unfavorable PCa prognosis. It is imperative to take such substantial misclassification rates into account for this sensitive PCa demographic of senior men. Future prospective studies are warranted to further optimize PCa workflow and diagnostics, such as to incorporate modern imaging, molecular profiling and implement these into biopsy strategies to identify true PCa burden.","output":"The Dilemma of Misclassification Rates in Senior Patients With Prostate Cancer, Who Were Treated With Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Patient Counseling and Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE Intra-arterial treatment (IAT) for acute ischemic stroke caused by intracranial arterial occlusion leads to improved functional outcome in patients treated within 6 hours after onset. The influence of treatment delay on treatment effect is not yet known. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of time from stroke onset to the start of treatment and from stroke onset to reperfusion on the effect of IAT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) was a multicenter, randomized clinical open-label trial of IAT vs no IAT in 500 patients. The time to the start of treatment was defined as the time from onset of symptoms to groin puncture (TOG). The time from onset of treatment to reperfusion (TOR) was defined as the time to reopening the vessel occlusion or the end of the procedure in cases for which reperfusion was not achieved. Data were collected from December 3, 2010, to June 3, 2014, and analyzed (intention to treat) from July 1, 2014, to September 19, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score for functional outcome (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Multiple ordinal logistic regression analysis estimated the effect of treatment and tested for the interaction of time to randomization, TOG, and TOR with treatment. The effect of treatment as a risk difference on reaching independence (mRS score, 0-2) was computed as a function of TOG and TOR. Calculations were adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and intracranial arterial terminus occlusion. RESULTS Among 500 patients (58% male; median age, 67 years), the median TOG was 260 (interquartile range [IQR], 210-311) minutes; median TOR, 340 (IQR, 274-395) minutes. An interaction between TOR and treatment (P = .04) existed, but not between TOG and treatment (P = .26). The adjusted risk difference (95% CI) was 25.9% (8.3%-44.4%) when reperfusion was reached at 3 hours, 18.8% (6.6%-32.6%) at 4 hours, and 6.7% (0.4%-14.5%) at 6 hours. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE For every hour of reperfusion delay, the initially large benefit of IAT decreases; the absolute risk difference for a good outcome is reduced by 6% per hour of delay.

CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2. Significance Preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways, depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo. This study also provides a handle to develop novel antiviral strategies aiming to block virus entry, as illustrated with the several drugs that we identified to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, some with low IC50.","output":"Host Cell Proteases Drive Early or Late SARS-CoV-2 Penetration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is likely to be limited, and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.","output":"Modelling of COVID-19 vaccination strategies and herd immunity, in scenarios of limited and full vaccine supply in NSW, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big challenge to the healthcare systems in the world.

Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices. METHODS: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. RESULTS: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. CONCLUSIONS: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.","output":"Measurement of hydroxychloroquine in blood from SLE patients using LC-HRMS-evaluation of whole blood, plasma, and serum as sample matrices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsThis poster reflects how the experience of staying with people of diverse nations and cultural background helped the stranded IMGs cope with this agony in a foreign land during an unprecedented tumultuous situation.

OBJECTIVE: Since it is unclear whether AD patients are prone to COVID-19 infection and progression to severe stages, we report for the first time a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the clinical data of 19 AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with 23 non-AD COVID-19 patients admitted at the same time to our hospital. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Between AD patients and non-AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the pneumonia severity was not significantly different. AD patients had a higher clustering onset than non-AD patients. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization were shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients, indicating the former were sent to the hospital by their family or from nursing home earlier than the later. The median duration from hospitalization to discharge seemed shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients. Dementia patients seemed less likely to report fatigue. It is noticed that more AD patients might have pericardial effusion than the non-AD patients.

Supportive KC devices may be an important tool clinicians can use to assist parents with KC. In recent years, there has been a rise in the availability of KC devices. However, the use, needs, and preferences for these supportive devices by neonatal clinicians have not been documented. PURPOSE: To survey clinicians' use, needs, and preferences of KC supportive devices, and examine whether differences exist based on clinician and organizational characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey was sent through neonatal organization Web sites, conferences, and social media. RESULTS: Many clinicians (n = 68, 43%; N = 158) facilitated KC with a supportive device, with 81% of devices provided by the clinician's employer. The most important \\"Must Have\\" feature of a KC device was \\"Safety: Reduces patient falls if caregiver sleeps or needs to use hands\\" (84% of respondents) followed by washability (82%), and \\"immediate, effective access to the baby\\" (78%). Clinicians' responses did not differ based on hospital setting, type of unit, KC experience, or experience using a KC device.

Behavioral control is mediated, in part, by cortical dopamine signaling. Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme primarily responsible for cortical dopamine inactivation, may increase cortical dopamine, especially among individuals with genetically mediated lower dopaminergic tone, such as COMT rs4680 (val158met) val-allele homozygotes. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, pharmacogenetic trial of the COMT inhibitor tolcapone. Ninety non-treatment-seeking AUD individuals were prospectively genotyped for rs4680 and randomized to tolcapone (200 mg t.i.d.) or placebo for 8 days. At baseline and on day 7, peripheral COMT activity was assayed, and participants completed an fMRI alcohol cue-reactivity task; on day 8, they completed a bar-lab paradigm. Primary outcomes were: (1) natural drinking during the medication period; (2) alcohol self-administration in the bar lab; and (3) alcohol cue-elicited cortical (right inferior frontal gyrus [rIFG]) and ventral striatal activation. At baseline, the rs4680 val-allele had an additive effect on COMT activity. Tolcapone, relative to placebo, reduced COMT activity in all genotype groups. COMT genotype moderated tolcapones effect on drinking during the medication period and in the bar lab, such that tolcapone, relative to placebo, reduced drinking only among val-allele homozygotes. Tolcapone did not affect cue-elicited ventral striatal activation but reduced rIFG activation; less rIFG activation on day 7 was associated with less drinking during the medication period. Taken together, these data suggest that COMT inhibition may reduce drinking specifically among individuals genetically predisposed to excessive COMT activity and potentially low cortical dopamine tone.

We explored the efficacy and safety of  12-month DAPT among MMACS patients. METHODS In this sub-analysis of the optimal antiplatelet therapy for Chinese Patients with Coronary Artery Disease study (NCT01735305), clinical outcomes among MMACS patients were compared between the < 12-month and  12-month DAPT groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Safety endpoints included the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2-5, BARC 3-5, and all bleeding events. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare baseline characteristics between the < 12-month and  12-month DAPT groups. RESULTS In this cohort of ACS patients (n = 10,016), MMACS patients (n = 2967) were less likely to use DAPT at 12 (31.64% vs. 67.47%, P < 0.0001) and 24 (13.82% vs. 18.71%, P < 0.0001) months and experienced more ischemic events at 12 (4.55% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.006) and 24 (6.88% vs. 5.08%, P = 0.0004) months than those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 7049). Among MMACS patients, the rate of primary efficacy endpoint occurring within the second year was significantly higher in the < 12-month DAPT group than in the  12-month group both before (2.88% vs. 1.60%, P = 0.040) and after (3.19% vs. 1.71%, P = 0.045) PSM. After PSM, no significant differences in all bleeding, BARC 2-5, and BARC 3-5 bleeding were found between the groups. CONCLUSION MMACS patients with insufficient DAPT management experienced relatively more ischemic events. DAPT for at least 1 year may be beneficial to this special population without significantly increasing the bleeding risks.

However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. METHODS: Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood(2000) high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. CONCLUSION: The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.","output":"Association between respiratory infections in early life and later asthma is independent of virus type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since March 2020, companies nationwide have started work from home (WFH) owing to the rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an attempt to help prevent the disease from spreading and to rescue the economy from the pandemic. Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand people's opinions toward WFH. However, the findings are limited owing to a small sample size and the dynamic topics over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public opinions regarding WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale social media study using Twitter data to portray different groups of individuals who have positive or negative opinions on WFH. We performed an ordinary least squares regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand the public opinion, we used latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and investigate how tweet contents are related to people's attitude. RESULTS: On performing ordinary least squares regression analysis using a large-scale data set of publicly available Twitter posts (n=28,579) regarding WFH during April 10-22, 2020, we found that the sentiment on WFH varies across user characteristics. In particular, women tend to be more positive about WFH (P<.001). People in their 40s are more positive toward WFH than those in other age groups (P<.001). People from high-income areas are more likely to have positive opinions about WFH (P<.001). These nuanced differences are supported by a more fine-grained topic analysis. At a higher level, we found that the most negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion on government policy. However, people express a more positive sentiment when discussing topics on \\"remote work or study\\" and \\"encouragement.\\" Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different user groups. Women pay more attention to family activities than men (P<.05). Older people talk more about work and express a more positive sentiment regarding WFH. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a large-scale social media-based study to understand the public opinion on WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that this study can contribute to policymaking both at the national and institution or company levels to improve the overall population's experience with WFH.","output":"Social Media Opinions on Working From Home in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science production related to COVID-19 has increased exponentially in recent months following the pandemic outbreak, yet little has been done to investigate this huge science production from a linguistic and data-driven perspective.

METHODS: All patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in a university hospital between 15th of May and 15th of July 2020 were prospectively enrolled into this cohort study. Patients treated with antivitamin K anticoagulants and with liver disease were excluded. All patients had protein S activity determined at admission. The main outcome was survival, secondary outcomes were clinical severity and lung damage. RESULTS: 91 patients were included, of which 21 (23.3%) died. Protein S activity was decreased in 65% of the patients. Death was associated with lower activity of protein S (median 42% vs. 58%, p<0.001), and the association remained after adjustment for age, inflammation markers and ALAT. There was a dose-response relationship between protein S activity and clinical severity (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.320, p < 0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001) or pulmonary damage on CT scan (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.290, p<0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001).

In recent years, the creation of both a risk governance framework and council has been actively pursued. Part of the function of a governance framework is the communication to external stakeholders. Existing descriptions on the public perceptions of nanotechnology are generally positive with the attendant economic and societal benefits being forefront in that thinking. Debates on nanomaterials' risk tend to be dominated by expert groupings while the general public is largely unaware of the potential hazards. Communicating via social media has become an integral part of everyday life facilitating public connectedness around specific topics that was not feasible in the pre-digital age. When civilian passive stakeholders become active their frustration can quickly coalesce into a campaign of resistance, and once an issue starts to develop into a campaign it is difficult to ease the momentum. Simmering discussions with moderate local attention can gain international exposure resulting in pressure and it can, in some cases, quickly precipitate legislative action and/or economic consequences.

While chest CT scans are routinely performed in the initial assessment of patients with severe pulmonary forms, thymus involvement and reactivation have not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we systematically scored the enlargement of the thymus and the lung involvement, using CT scans, in all adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID or any other cause (control group) at one centre between March and April 2020. Initial biological investigations included nasal detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a subgroup of 24 patients with different degrees of pulmonary involvement and thymus hypertrophy, plasma cytokine concentrations were measured and the export of mature T cells from the thymus was estimated simultaneously by PCR quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were studied: 50 COVID patients and 37 controls. Non-atrophic or enlarged thymus was more commonly observed in COVID patients than in controls (66% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). Thymus enlargement in COVID patients was associated with more extensive lung injury score on CT scans (4 [3C5] vs. 2 [1.5C4], p = 0.01), but a lower mortality rate (8.6% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with mortality were age, lymphopaenia, high CRP and co-morbidities. COVID patients had higher concentrations of IL-7 (6.00 [3.72C9.25] vs. 2.17 [1.76C4.4] pg/mL; p = 0.04) and higher thymic production of new lymphocytes (sj/TREC ratio = 2.88 [1.98C4.51] vs. 0.23 [0.15C0.60]; p = 0.004). Thymic production was also correlated with the CT scan thymic score (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) and inversely correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In COVID patients, thymus enlargement was frequent and associated with increased T lymphocyte production, which appears to be a beneficial adaptation to virus-induced lymphopaenia. The lack of thymic activity/reactivation in older SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could contribute to a worse prognosis.

Host cell proteases that process the glycoproteins of these viruses are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The aspartyl protease signal peptide peptidase (SPP) has recently been shown to be required for processing of the glycoprotein precursor, Gn/Gc, of Bunyamwera virus and for viral infectivity. Here, we investigated whether SPP is also required for infectivity of particles bearing SFTSV-Gn/Gc. Entry driven by the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the Lassa virus glycoprotein (LASV-GPC) depends on the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/CatL) and the serine protease subtilisin/kexin-isozyme 1 (SKI-1), respectively, and was examined in parallel for control purposes. We found that inhibition of SPP and SKI-1 did not interfere with SFTSV Gn + Gc-driven entry but, unexpectedly, blocked entry mediated by EBOV-GP. The inhibition occurred at the stage of proteolytic activation and the SPP inhibitor was found to block CatL/CatB activity. In contrast, the SKI-1 inhibitor did not interfere with CatB/CatL activity but disrupted CatB localization in endo/lysosomes, the site of EBOV-GP processing. These results underline the potential of protease inhibitors for antiviral therapy but also show that previously characterized compounds might exert broader specificity than initially appreciated and might block viral entry via diverse mechanisms.","output":"Inhibitors of signal peptide peptidase and subtilisin/kexin-isozyme 1 inhibit Ebola virus glycoprotein-driven cell entry by interfering with activity and cellular localization of endosomal cathepsins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mines, quarries, dumps, and tailings are the sources of air pollution.

One area that is severely affected is ear, nose and throat (ENT)/laryngology where speech and language therapists (SLTs) engage in a diverse range of practice with patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems, and head and neck cancers (HNCs). A large majority of these patients are in high-risk categories, and many specialized clinical practices are vulnerable. In addition, workforce and research issues are challenged in both the immediate context and the future. AIMS: To discuss the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for SLTs in ENT/laryngology with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. METHODS & PROCEDURES: The relevant sections of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health systems building blocks framework (2007) were used to structure the study. Expert agreement was determined by an iterative process of multiple-group discussions, the use of all recent relevant policy documentation, and other literature and shared documentation/writing. The final paper was verified and agreed by all authors. MAIN CONTRIBUTION: The main threats to ENT/laryngology SLT clinical services include increased patient complexity related to COVID-19 voice and airway problems, delayed HNC diagnosis, reduced access to instrumental procedures and inequitable care provision. The main clinical opportunities include the potential for new modes of service delivery and collaborations, and harnessing SLT expertise in non-instrumental assessment. There are several workforce issues, including redeployment (and impact on current services), training implications and psychological impact on staff. Workforce opportunities exist for service innovation and potential extended ENT/SLT practice roles. Research is threatened by a reduction in immediate funding calls and high competition. Current research is affected by very limited access to participants and the ability to conduct face-to-face and instrumental assessments. However, research opportunities may result in greater collaboration, and changes in service delivery necessitate robust investigation and evaluation. A new national set of research priorities is likely to emerge. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The immediate impact of the pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. It is unclear when any of these areas will resume operations and whether permanent changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities will follow. However, significant opportunity exists in the post-COVID era to re-evaluate current practice, embrace opportunities and evaluate new ways of working. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject ENT/laryngology SLTs manage patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems and HNCs. The diverse scope of clinical practice involves highly specialized assessment and treatment practices in patients in high-risk categories. A large majority of active research projects in this field are patient focused and involve instrumental assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has created both opportunities and threats for ENT SLT clinical services, workforce and research. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides a discussion of the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for ENT/laryngology SLT with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. Changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities are of indeterminant duration at this time, and some components could be permanent. Significant clinical practice, workforce and research opportunities may exist in the post-COVID era.","output":"COVID-19 and ENT SLT services, workforce and research in the UK: A discussion paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We talk to Laura Martin-Sancho and Sumit Chanda about their paper, \\"Functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 cellular restriction,\\" their journeys across the world to their current positions, the people and technologies that inspired them along their career paths, and being scientifically prepared for the next pandemic.","output":"Meet the authors: Laura Martin-Sancho and Sumit K.

The optimal type and duration of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in these patients remain unknown. METHODS: This manuscript reports the final (90-day) results of the Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) study. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care were randomized to intermediate-dose versus standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for 30 days, irrespective of hospital discharge status. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or all-cause death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS: Of 600 randomized patients, 562 entered the modified intention-to-treat analysis (median age [Q1, Q3]; 62 (50, 71) years; 237 (42.2%) women), of whom 336 (59.8%) survived to hospital discharge. The primary outcome occurred in 132 (47.8%) of patients assigned to intermediate-dose and 130 (45.4%) patients assigned to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.55, P=0.11). No significant differences were observed between the two groups for other efficacy outcomes, or in the landmark analysis from days 31-90.

The standard of care for pharmacological interventions evolved during this period as new and repurposed treatments were used alone and in combination. Though these medications have been studied individually, data are limited regarding the relative impact of different medication combinations. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the association of COVID-19-related mortality and observed medication combinations and to determine whether changes in medication-related practice patterns and measured patient characteristics, alone, explain the decline in mortality seen early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a multi-hospital healthcare system exploring the association of mortality and combinations of remdesivir, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of mortality for both the overall population and the population stratified by intensive care and non-intensive care unit admissions. A separate model was created to control for the change in unmeasured variables over time. RESULTS: For all patients, four treatment combinations were associated with lower mortality: Anticoagulation Only (OR 0.24, p < 0.0001), Anticoagulation and Remdesivir (OR 0.25, p = 0.0031), Anticoagulation and Corticosteroids (OR 0.53, p = 0.0263), and Anticoagulation, Corticosteroids and Remdesivir (OR 0.42, p = 0.026). For non-intensive care unit patients, the same combinations were significantly associated with lower mortality. For patients admitted to the intensive care unit, Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with decreased mortality. When adjusted for demographics, clinical characteristics, and all treatment combinations there was an absolute decrease in the mortality rate by 2.5% between early and late periods of the study. However, when including an additional control for changes in unmeasured variables overtime, the absolute mortality rate decreased by 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that anticoagulation was the most significant treatment for the reduction of COVID-related mortality. Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with a significant decrease in mortality for both intensive care and non-intensive care patients. Treatment combinations that additionally included corticosteroids and/or remdesivir were also associated with decreased mortality, though only in the non-intensive care stratum.

Definition of the hilar structures is crucial to safe VATS lobectomy. Several VATS approaches have been described. We report the effect of three surgeons in our institution undertaking standardized anterior approach (SAA) training on the proportion of isolated lobectomies subsequently completed by VATS. Predictors of successful VATS lobectomy were analysed. METHODS Three consultant surgeons undertook SAA training at two different time points. Two were performing VATS lobectomy prior to SAA training. Training involved a 2-day visit to an established SAA unit. Lobectomies performed by these surgeons between April 2011 and December 2012 (20 months), before and after training, were recorded prospectively. Bilobectomies, sleeve resections, pneumonectomies and chest wall resections were excluded. VATS lobectomy proportions before and after training were compared. Independent predictors of completion by VATS rather than thoracotomy were identified by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS One hundred and sixty-three isolated lobectomies were performed, 97 of these by VATS (59.5%). The mean age was 68.8 ( 10.5) years. Pathology was lung cancer in 137 (84.0%), other primary malignancy in 10 (6.1%), pulmonary metastases in 8 (4.9%) and benign in 8 (4.9%). The VATS lobectomy rate rose from 22.2% before SAA training to 77.3% after, P < 0.001. The effect was significant for both existing and adopting VATS lobectomy surgeons, P = 0.002 to <0.001. The median hospital stay was 4 days after VATS and 5 after thoracotomy, P < 0.001. There were 5 in-hospital deaths after thoracotomy and none after VATS lobectomy, unadjusted P = 0.01. In the final logistic regression model, SAA training was the strongest predictor of successful VATS lobectomy (odds ratio 15.16; 95% confidence interval 6.39, 35.96). CONCLUSIONS Formal training and adoption of the SAA approach were associated with a more than 3-fold increase in our VATS lobectomy rate. The effect was immediate and sustained. This may reflect easier identification of the major structures from the anterior view. In addition, standardization of surgical techniques and perioperative protocols may facilitate efficient team working. VATS lobectomy was associated with a shorter median hospital stay.

Improving the access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) could be a win-win strategy, because the lack of these services not only hampers the implementation of preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. proper handwashing), but it is also connected to high mortality diseases (for example, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections (LRI)). This study aims to build on the evidence-based link between other LRI and WASH as a proxy for exploring the potential vulnerability of African countries to COVID-19, as well as the role of other socioeconomic variables such as financial sources or demographic factors. The selected methodology combines several machine learning techniques to single out the most representative variables for the analysis, classify the countries according to their capacity to tackle public health emergencies and identify behavioural patterns for each group. Besides, conditional dependences between variables are inferred through a Bayesian network. Results show a strong relationship between low access to WASH services and high LRI mortality rates, and that migrant remittances could significantly improve the access to healthcare and WASH services.

When young children, like the 2 year-old case presented here, are evaluated for wheezing, a frequent challenge for clinicians is to determine whether the symptoms represent transient, viral-induced wheezing, or whether sufficient risk factors are present to suspect that the child may experience recurrent wheezing and develop asthma. Most factors influencing prognosis are not mutually exclusive, are interrelated (i.e., cofactors), and often represent gene-environment interactions. Many of these risk factors have been, and continue to be, investigated in prospective studies in order to decipher their relative importance with the goal of developing new therapies and interventions in the future.

These changes include decreases in the volume of the thoracic cavity, reduced lung volumes, and alterations in the muscles that aid respiration. Muscle function on a cellular level in the aging population is less efficient. The elderly population has less pulmonary reserve, and cough strength is decreased in the elderly population due to anatomic changes and muscle atrophy. Clearance of particles from the lung through the mucociliary elevator is decreased and associated with ciliary dysfunction. Many complex changes in immunity with aging contribute to increased susceptibility to infections including a less robust immune response from both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Considering all of these age-related changes to the lungs, pulmonary disease has significant consequences for the aging population. Chronic lower respiratory tract disease is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older.

Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the cold chain transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated T(H)1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development.

Methods: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

Previously, three viral proteinases were reported to cleave these large polyproteins into 12 non-structural proteins (nsps). The chymotrypsin-like viral main proteinase residing in nsp4 is responsible for eight of these cleavages. Processing of the C-terminal half of pp1a (the nsp3-8 region) was postulated to occur following either of two alternative proteolytic pathways (the 'major' and 'minor' pathways). Here, the importance of these two pathways was investigated by using a reverse-genetics system and inactivating each of the cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis. For all of these pp1a cleavage sites, mutations that prevented cleavage by the nsp4 proteinase were found to block or severely inhibit EAV RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our studies identified a novel nsp4 cleavage site (Glu-1575/Ala-1576) that is located within nsp7 and is conserved in arteriviruses. The N-terminal nsp7 fragment (nsp7alpha) derived from this cleavage was detected in lysates of both EAV-infected cells and cells transiently expressing pp1a.

I study a simple epidemiological model, in which mutations may change the properties of the virus and its associated disease stochastically and antigenic drifts allow new variants to partially evade immunity. I show analytically that variants with higher infectiousness, longer disease duration, and shorter latent period prove to be fitter. Smart containment policies targeting symptomatic individuals may redirect the evolution of the virus, as they give an edge to variants with a longer incubation period and a higher share of asymptomatic infections. Reduced mortality, on the other hand, does not per se prove to be an evolutionary advantage. I then implement this model as an agent-based simulation model in order to explore its aggregate dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations show that a) containment policy design has an impact on both speed and direction of viral evolution, b) the virus may circulate in the population indefinitely, provided that containment efforts are too relaxed and the propensity of the virus to escape immunity is high enough, and crucially c) that it may not be possible to distinguish between a slowly and a rapidly evolving virus by looking only at short-term epidemiological outcomes. Thus, what looks like a successful mitigation strategy in the short run, may prove to have devastating long-run effects.

The pandemic has exerted a negative impact on the social support of individuals, and as a result, the behavior of a person is more likely to be at risk and has resulted in psychological crisis in people/individuals. METHODS: A sample of 3137 graduate students responded to the instrument developed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the academic activities and performance, Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: The results showed that: 1) the pandemic impacted the academic support and performance of graduate students in varying degrees, 21% of graduate students experienced anxiety, and 33.9% of graduate students experienced depressive symptoms in varying degrees; 2) academic support variables (ie, academic exchange with mentors and peers) and academic performance variables (ie, data collection and thesis writing) were significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms; 3) the model fitted the data well (RMSEA = 0.029; SRMR = 0.014; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.996).

It shows that the countries differ in their approach to counter hybrid threats in terms of their organisation of security and the scope of measures taken to deter adversaries. These differences are mainly rooted in historical, institutional and political processes. The countries are rather similar in detecting hybrid threats and responding to hybrid attacks, which can be explained by the nature of hybrid threats. Consequently, strategic culture is a context that shapes but not ultimately determines how Finland, Germany and the Netherlands counter hybrid threats.

There is some evidence this attitude may be prevalent amongst UK surgical trainees, resulting in difficulty recruiting to rural settings. In addition, studies have compared mortality in paediatric trauma patients in rural and urban hospitals, but none have described types of injury or orthopaedic operations required. We hypothesise the distribution of operative, orthopaedic paediatric trauma in a rural district general and an urban major trauma centre will not differ significantly in terms of patterns and mechanism of injury, orthopaedic intervention or time to theatre. MATERIALS/METHODS: All operative paediatric patients (0C15yrs) seen during an acute orthopaedic take at a rural district general and an urban major trauma centre were included. Non-operative admissions were excluded. Patients were identified using daily trauma work lists from each site. Outcomes were age, injury type, operation, time to theatre, seasonality and mechanism. RESULTS: 183 patients from the urban hospital and 103 from the rural were identified. There were no significant differences found in age of patient, seasonality or time to theatre between cohorts (p > 0.05). There were also broadly similar patterns of injury and operations performed in both groups, although k-wiring was more often employed in the rural cohort than the urban (27% vs 17% of total operations).

The role strain and role enhancement theories guide our theoretical predictions. While the former predicts a lower wellbeing due to the double burden of grandchild care and paid work, the latter posits an increase in wellbeing through the accumulation of social identities or roles. By using longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we investigate whether grandmothers who do and those who do not work experience different levels of quality of life, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Our statistical model consists in a fixed-effect regression that adjusts for the lagged outcome. Results show that, among grandmothers engaged in paid work, grandchild care is not significantly associated with any of the three outcomes considered. Instead, non-working grandmothers seem to benefit from provision of grandchild care, in terms of higher quality of life and lower number of depressive symptoms. As thus, the provision of grandchild care tends to be beneficial for grandmothers wellbeing only if they do not combine this activity with paid work.

A nomogram was constructed and exhibited favorable discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.78), calibration [Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test p = 0.904], and net benefits displayed by decision curve analysis (DCA). Conclusions: Patients who underwent fURS compared to PNL or have certain pre-operative characteristics, such as albumin <35 g/L and positive urine culture, are more likely to develop postoperative sepsis. Cautious preoperative evaluation and appropriate operation type are crucial to reducing serious infectious events after surgery, especially for patients with solitary, unilateral, and proximal ureteral stones sized 10-20 mm.","output":"A Novel Nomogram for Predicting Post-Operative Sepsis for Patients With Solitary, Unilateral and Proximal Ureteral Stones After Treatment Using Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy or Flexible Ureteroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to grocery shop is an important aspect of maintaining adequate nutritional status among older adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many older adults changed their typical grocery shopping habits attempting to remain safe. To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced older adults' grocery shopping habits. In this qualitative study, a total of 23 older adults aged 60 years or older participated in individual interviews via Zoom. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis. Attempting to be cautious, most participants reported altering grocery shopping habits by shopping less frequently, using online services such as grocery pickup or delivery, or having friends or family members do the shopping. However, some participants continued shopping in stores due to poor quality produce items picked out by shoppers and safe policies implemented by stores. Also, grocery shopping in stores became incentivized as some participants viewed it as a form of entertainment, social interaction, and even physical activity during the pandemic. Although many stores offered senior shopping hours, the majority of study participants reported not using these services due to inconvenient times. Purchasing larger quantities of items and selecting more shelf stable, canned, and frozen items were also reported. Providing older adults with training and education on using online grocery shopping services may help this population have safe and simple access to healthy food items. In addition, training grocery store workers to pick out good quality produce may encourage more older adults to use these online services. Modifications to grocery store-instated senior hours should consider more convenient times to best support older adults. Because the grocery store emerged as an enjoyable place, it is especially crucial that grocery stores continue to enforce the policies that allow older adults to feel safe purchasing their groceries.

They have an uncertain pathogenesis and unclear clinical behavior. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical presentation of solid pseudopapillary tumors and assess the efficacy of treatment with minimally invasive surgery. METHODS From March 1997 to February 2011, 13 of 273 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures on the pancreas were found to have solid pseudopapillary tumors. There were 12 female patients and 1 male patient. The median age was 21 years (range, 15-77 years). Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (n=9). Tumors were incidentally found in 3 patients on computed tomography scans obtained for other reasons. RESULTS Enucleation of the tumor was performed in 4 patients, including 3 in whom the tumor was located in the head of the pancreas. Eight patients underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, whereas spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed in one case. The median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1.5-11 cm), the median operative time was 197 minutes (range, 68-320 minutes), and the median blood loss was 50 mL (range, <50-750 mL). Distal resections were performed with a linear stapler. Four patients had postoperative complications. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 2-12 days). During a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 3-121 months), no local recurrences or distant metastases were found. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic resections and enucleations of solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas can be performed safely and with adequate resection margins even if the tumors are located in the head of the organ.","output":"Laparoscopic surgery for solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a benign entity but can worsen the underlying condition with which it is associated.

In 2020, remdesivir was recognized as the most promising therapeutic agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effects of remdesivir on cancers have hardly been studied. PURPOSE: Here, we reported that the anti-carcinogenic effect of remdesivir on SKOV3 cells, one of human ovarian cancer cell lines. RESEARCH DESIGN: We anlalyzed the anti-carcarcinogenic effect of remdesivir in SKOV3 cells by performing in vitro cell assay and western blotting. RESULTS: WST-1 showed that remdesivir decreased cell viability in SKOV3 cells. Experiments conducted by Muse Cell Analyzer showed that remdesivir-induced apoptosis in SKOV3 cells. We found that the expression level of FOXO3, Bax, and Bim increased, whereas Bcl-2, caspase-3, and caspase-7 decreased by remdesivir in SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, we observed that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level increased after treatment of remdesivir in SKOV3 cells. Interestingly, cytotoxicity of remdesivir decreased after treatment of N-Acetylcysteine. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrated that remdesivir has an anti-carcinogenic effect on SKOV3 cells vis up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, which suggests that remdesivir could be a promising reagent for treatment of ovarian cancer.","output":"An in vitro study on anti-carcinogenic effect of remdesivir in human ovarian cancer cells via generation of reactive oxygen species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To consider the challenges of communicating COVID-19 directives to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Australia, and present evidence-based solutions to influence policy and practice on promoting relevant health behaviours; to advance participatory research methodologies for health behaviour change. Type of program or service: We present a case study of a participatory research collaboration between CALD community leaders and health behaviour change scientists during the COVID-19 crisis. The goal was to better understand the role of community leaders in shaping health behaviours in their communities and how that role might be leveraged for better health outcomes. METHODS This article is the culmination of a series of dialogues between CALD community and advocacy leaders, and health behaviour change scientists in July 2020. The academic authors recruited 12 prominent CALD community leaders, conducted five semi-structured dialogues with small groups, and worked with all participants to develop insights that were applicable to the many different CALD communities represented in the research collaboration. RESULTS Three key findings emerged: 1) partnerships between CALD leaders, communities and government are critical for effective health communication; 2) shifting behaviour requires moving beyond disseminating information to designing tailored solutions; and 3) the diverse needs and circumstances of people and communities must be at the centre of health communication and behaviour change strategies. LESSONS LEARNT The collaborative process we undertook in this study enabled us to identify key challenges experienced and solutions offered by CALD leaders in communicating health information throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with communities that are subject to health messaging can reduce inequalities in healthcare communication by enabling the development of strategies that help align human behaviour with the recommendations of health experts. This - along with sustained partnership and collaboration with CALD communities, understanding the cultural context, and the appropriate tailoring and delivery of communications - will ensure health-related messages are not lost in translation. The lessons provided in this paper are applicable not only to the current pandemic but also to post-pandemic social and economic recovery.","output":"Communicating COVID-19 health information to culturally and linguistically diverse communities: insights from a participatory research collaboration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary care physicians are rarely mentioned in medical disaster plans. We describe how a group of mostly family physicians and administrators of the JPS Health Network (JPS) took primary responsibility for 3,700 evacuees of Hurricane Katrina who came to Tarrant County, Texas. JPS provided medical care to 1,664 (45%) evacuees during a 2-week period. The most common needs were medications for chronic illnesses and treatment of skin infections (primarily on the feet). The JPS Emergency Department saw only 148 evacuees, most of whom arrived by their own transportation and were not seriously ill. JPS created a triage center located several miles from the hospital that referred almost all evacuees with health care needs to a primary care clinic. It was an effective approach for caring for the medical needs of disaster victims and prevented an emergency department and hospital from being overwhelmed.

Coronavirus is shown to contribute to respiratory tract infections that can lead to prolonged cough and asthma. OBJECTIVES: Present study aimed to determine the risk of developing Persistent cough and asthma-like symptoms in hospitalized children due to COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in a tertiary referral center. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 69 hospitalized pediatric patients admitted with COVID-19 were observed from February 2020 to January 2021. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded, and after discharge, patients were followed and visited for cough and asthma evaluation one, 2 and 6 months later. Patients with asthma-like diagnoses in follow up defined as asthma-like groups, and patients without any sign of asthma were categorized as the non-asthma group. Asthma-like co-morbids and risk factors were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In follow-up, most of the COVID-19 hospitalized patients (N = 42) (58.5%) were not affected by asthma-like symptoms. 60.9% of the COVID-19 patients were male. The asthma-like group cases had a significantly familial history of asthma (63.0%), past medical history of asthma (33.3%), and Allergic rhinitis (85.2%). Rates of signs and symptoms during hospitalization were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 and past medical history of asthma. CONCLUSIONS: We found an asthma-like prevalence of 41.5% in the cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized children. Family history of asthma and previous history of asthma and allergic rhinitis are risk factors for asthma-like after COVID-19 hospitalization.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) is, to this day, the preferred methodology for viral RNA detection, even if not without problems. To overcome some of the limitations still existing for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in various applications, the use of one-step reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) has been established. The purpose of this study was, then, to evaluate the efficacy of ddPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, optimizing the detection of low-viral load-burdened samples. METHODS: The RT-ddPCR workflow was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision using samples from 90 COVID-19-infected patients referred to the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Udine (Italy). RESULTS: The present study shows that RT-ddPCR allows the detection of as low as 10.3 copies of a SARS-COV-2 E-gene per sample with a higher level of accuracy and precision, especially at low concentration. CONCLUSION: During the postpeak phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is essential to rely on a highly robust molecular biology method to identify infected subjects, whether they have symptoms or not, in order to prepare appropriate containment measures.","output":"Validation of a One-Step Reverse Transcription-Droplet Digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) Approach to Detect and Quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Nasopharyngeal Swabs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India is in the midst of a fierce pandemic with a rapid surge of cases and the health-care system in a quandary.

Due to privacy reasons, most of the users will not disclose their location. Detecting the location of the tweet users is required to track the geographic location of the spreading diseases. This work aims to detect the spreading location of the COVID-19 disease from the Twitter users and content discussed in the tweet. COVID-19 is a disease caused by the \\"novel coronavirus.\\" About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease. However, one out of every six people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill, stated by the World health organization. Inferring the user location for identifying the spreading location for the disease is a very challenging task. This paper proposes a new technique based on a hypergraph model to detect the Twitter user's locations based on the spreading disease. This model uses hypergraph with weighting factor technique to infer the spreading disease's spatial location. The accuracy of prediction can be improved when a massive volume of streaming data is analyzed. The Helly property of the hypergraph was applied to discard less potential words from the text analysis, which claims this work of unique nature. A weighting factor was introduced to calculate the score of each location for a particular user. The location of each user is predicted based on the one that possesses the highest weighting factor. The proposed framework has been evaluated and tested for various measures like precision, recall and F-measure. The promising results obtained have substantiated the claim for this work compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.","output":"Epidemic zone of COVID-19 from social media using hypergraph with weighting factor (HWF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tropical infections constitute 20 C 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in developing countries.

The poor prognostic markers are hemorrhagic ARDS, acute renal failure, DIC, severe metabolic acidosis, older age, chronic alcohol abuse, high SOFA score, and septic shock. The confirmatory diagnosis relies on antibody testing, such as microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and IgM ELISA, while the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test being reserved for clinically suspected antibody negative cases. The spectrum of multi-organ involvement necessitates a complete hematological, biochemical workup, including electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and two-dimensional echocardiography.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 129 patients with an average age of 49.88.9 years who had undergone COVID-19 using a continuous sample method. Patients for the study were selected at the clinical bases of outpatient clinics in Samara (Russia) in July-August 2020. All patients signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment. Patients were randomized into two groups: in the main group (n=64), ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (Neurox) was prescribed 1 tablet (125 mg) 3 times a day for 4 weeks; in the comparison group (n=65), medical drugs (MD) did not contain substances from the pharmacological group related to antihypoxants/antioxidants/nootropics. Three visits (V) were conducted: the first (V1) - the period of inclusion, the second (V2) - after 14 days, the third (V3) - on the 28th day from the start of therapy. The dynamics of the general state (weakness, fatigue, concentration, dizziness, headache, sleep disorders) were evaluated on a visual-analog scale (VAS), the assessment of the subjective feeling of severity of asthenia (fatigue, physical and mental fatigue, decreased motivation and activity) - on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), cognitive functions - on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), vegetative tone - according to the Kerdo index. RESULTS: At the end of the study (V3), statistically significant changes in indicators (VAS, MFI-20) were obtained only in the main group patients; no statistically significant differences were obtained for the Kerdo index. Analysis of the MMSE data revealed a decrease in cognitive functions in both groups, which may be associated with pseudocognitive deficits due to asthenia.

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort SETTING: A total of 6 databases consisting of electronic medical records and claims data from France, Spain, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women with [] 1 year in contributing databases, diagnosed and/or tested positive, or hospitalized with COVID-19. The influenza cohort was derived from the 2017-2018 influenza season. OUTCOMES: Baseline patient characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms; 30-day inpatient drug utilization, maternal complications and pregnancy-related outcomes following diagnosis/hospitalization. RESULTS: 8,598 women diagnosed (2,031 hospitalized) with COVID-19 were included. Hospitalized women had, compared to those diagnosed, a higher prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities including renal impairment (2.2% diagnosed vs 5.1% hospitalized) and anemia (15.5% diagnosed vs 21.3% hospitalized).

Both NADPH oxidase-dependent and -independent pathways are involved in NET formation. The IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in human serum. However, the impact of the circulating IgG on NET formation is totally unexplored. In this study, the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced mature granulocytes (dHL-60) were pre-treated with monomeric human IgG, papain-digested Fab fragment, crystallizable IgG Fc portion, rituximab (a human IgG1), or IgG2. The NET formation of the dHL-60 in the presence/absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation was then measured by the fluorescent area after SYTOX green nucleic acid stain. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by flow cytometry. Total and phosphorylated Syk, SHP-1, and ERK were detected by immunoblot. We found that human monomeric IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 per se induced negligible NET formation of dHL-60, but the FcRIII engagement by these IgG subclasses and Fc portion augment PMA-stimulated dHL-60 NET formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that increased Syk and ERK phosphorylation, intracellular ROS generation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-, production could be induced after FcRIII engagement. Blocking FcRIII engagement by a specific antibody diminished the augmented NET formation. In conclusion, we discovered that cross-talk between FcRIII engagement-induced Syk-ERK and PMA-induced PKC signaling pathways augment NET formation of dHL-60 via increased ROS generation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-, production.","output":"The FcRIII Engagement Augments PMA-Stimulated Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) Formation by Granulocytes Partially via Cross-Talk between Syk-ERK-NF-B and PKC-ROS Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data regarding antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients infected with COVID-19 are not yet available.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies. FUNDING: The study was supported by Regione Lombardia, Milano Serravalle - Milano Tangenziali S.p.A., Brembo S.p.A, and by MEI System.","output":"COVID-19 and lombardy: TESTing the impact of the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To understand whether and how effective integration of health and social care might occur in the context of major system disruption (the COVID-19 pandemic), with a focus on how the initiative may overcome past barriers to integration. DESIGN: Rapid, descriptive case study approach with deviant case sampling to gather and analyse key informant interviews and relevant archival documents. SETTING: The innovation (COVID-19 Protect) took place in Norfolk and Waveney, UK, and aimed to foster integration across highly diverse organisations, capitalising on existing digital technology to proactively identify and support individuals most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six key informants directly involved with project conceptualisation and early implementation. Participants included clinicians, executives, digital/information technology leads, and others. Final sample size was determined by theoretical saturation. RESULTS: Four primary recurrent themes characterised the experiences of diverse team members in the project: (1) ways of working that supported rapid collaboration, (2) leveraging diversity and clinician input for systems change, (3) allowing for both central control and local adaptation and (4) balancing risk taking and accountability. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid case study underscores the role of leadership in large systems change efforts, particularly in times of major disruption. Project leadership overcame barriers to integration highlighted by prior studies, including engaging with aversion to clinical/safety risk, fostering distributed leadership and developing shared organisational practices for data sharing and service delivery. These insights offer considerations for future efforts to support strategic integration of health and social care.","output":"The role of leadership in times of systems disruption: a qualitative study of health and social care integration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As this special issue demonstrates, evidence on culture and health is emerging in a variety of new frameworks, including international comparisons, national analyses, individual health, and population health.

Wearable devices serve as an interface between humans and technology; however, this integration is far from seamless. These devices face various limitations such as size, biocompatibility, and battery constraints wherein batteries are bulky, are expensive, and require regular replacement. On-body energy harvesting presents a promising alternative to battery power by utilizing the human body's continuous generation of energy. This review paper begins with an investigation of contemporary energy harvesting methods, with a deep focus on piezoelectricity. We then highlight the materials, configurations, and structures of such methods for self-powered devices. Here, we propose a novel combination of thin-film composites, kirigami patterns, and auxetic structures to lay the groundwork for an integrated piezoelectric system to monitor and sense. This approach has the potential to maximize energy output by amplifying the piezoelectric effect and manipulating the strain distribution. As a departure from bulky, rigid device design, we explore compositions and microfabrication processes for conformable energy harvesters. We conclude by discussing the limitations of these harvesters and future directions that expand upon current applications for wearable technology. Further exploration of materials, configurations, and structures introduce interdisciplinary applications for such integrated systems. Considering these factors can revolutionize the production and consumption of energy as wearable technology becomes increasingly prevalent in everyday life.","output":"On-Body Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters through Innovative Designs and Conformable Structures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Otolaryngology is considered high risk for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure and spread This has led to a transition to telemedicine and directly impacts patient volume, evaluation and management practices The objective of this study is to determine the impact of COVID-19 on patient characteristics in relation to outpatient attendance, ancillary testing, medical therapy, and surgical decision making Methods A retrospective case series at an academic medical center was performed Outpatient appointments from October 2019 (pre-COVID) and March 16CApril 10, 2020 (COVID) were analyzed Prevalence rates and odds ratios were used to compare demographics, visit characteristics, ancillary tests, medication prescribing, and surgical decisions between telemedicine and in-person visits, before and during COVID Results There was a decrease in scheduled visits during the COVID timeframe, for both in-person and telemedicine visits, with a comparable proportion of no-shows There was a higher overall percentage of Hispanic/Latino patients who received care during the COVID timeframe (OR = 1 43;95% CI = 1 07C1 90) in both groups, although primary language was not significantly associated with attendance There were fewer ancillary tests ordered (OR = 0 54) and more medications prescribed (OR = 1 59) during COVID telemedicine visits compared with pre-COVID in-person visits Conclusion COVID-19 has rapidly changed the use of telemedicine Telemedicine can be used as a tool to reach patients with severe disease burden Continued healthcare reform, expanded access to affordable care, and efficient use of resources is essential both during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond Level of evidence IV","output":"Effects of COVID-19 on telemedicine practice patterns in outpatient otolaryngology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: One of the most affected groups during the COVID-19 pandemic was health-care providers due to the direct and continuous exposure to the virus and a lack of sufficient medical equipment. Palestinian health-care providers were exposed to several challenges related to their work environment as they worked in war-like conditions;therefore, this study aims to explore health-care providers perceptions, perspectives, challenges and human rights-related concerns during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprised 30 health-care providers 26C35 years, who were purposively selected from among health-care providers in two Palestinian cities, Nablus and Tulkarm, located in the north of the West Bank. Thematic content analysis was applied to transcripts of interviews with the practitioners to identify key themes. Findings: The thematic content analysis showed that the pandemic and quarantine negatively affect the mental health outcomes, daily routine and social relations of health-care providers. The main challenges related to human rights violations and faced by the health-care providers include a lack of sufficient infrastructure, lack of medical equipments and protective gear, military occupation and a shortage of health-care providers in general, especially those who practice in speciality fields such as neurology, oncology, pediatric surgery and clinical psychology. Practical implications: Further investigations are recommended to test different variables related to health-care providers work during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper also recommends conducting studies targeting Palestinian health-care providers training and supervision services to improve their skills and resiliency in dealing with future crises.

According to the supplier's instructions, the mobile phase must be prepared before the test is carried out, and the recommended stationary phase is off-market. We propose a new method for RCP measurement in which the mobile phase is acid citrate dextrose, solution A, which does not need to be prepared beforehand, and thin-layer chromatography is performed with a silica gel-impregnated glass fibre sheet as the stationary phase. We used both methods to measure the percentages of radiopharmaceutical and impurities. RESULTS The range of RCP values obtained was 98.0-99.9% (mean=99.3%) by the standard method and 98.1-99.9% (mean=99.2%) by the new method. We observed no differences between the RCP values of both methods (P=0.070). CONCLUSION The proposed method is suitable for RCP testing because it yields results that are in good agreement with those of the standard method and because it is easier to perform as the mobile-phase solution need not be prepared in advance.","output":"A new method for the radiochemical purity measurement of 111In-pentetreotide."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report our experience in surgical treatment of patients with COVID-19.

However, few attempts to confirm such a relationship have been made. Wild ruminant species have very marked seasonal changes in their reproductive function and strong annual changes in their plasma testosterone concentration. OBJECTIVES The present work examines the influence of induced changes in testosterone secretion on sperm variables following conventional slow freezing and ultra-rapid freezing, using the Iberian ibex as an experimental model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a first experiment, testosterone levels were reduced in the middle of the rutting season (December) using the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CA). In a second experiment, testosterone levels were increased at end of the rutting season (January) via the use of the androgen testosterone propionate (TP). RESULTS During December, the testosterone concentration was found to be higher in the blood and seminal plasma of untreated males than of CA-treated males (P<0.001 and P<0.05 respectively). Compared to controls, the TP-treated animals had higher blood plasma testosterone concentrations but lower seminal plasma testosterone concentrations during January (P<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively). The seminal vesicles of the TP-treated males were larger than those of untreated males (P<0.05). When CA was administered, sperm viability improved compared to controls (P<0.05), irrespective of the freezing protocol followed. For the ultra-rapid freezing procedure, the cryoresistance ratio for motility decreased when TP was administered (P<0.05). The values for fresh sperm morphometric variables decreased during the 50 days after the end of CA-treatment (P<0.001), and increased over the same time after the end of TP treatment (P<0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The circulating testosterone concentration appears to influence sperm cryoresistance. This may explain the seasonal changes seen in sperm freezability in some species, independent of fresh sperm quality.","output":"Influence of circulating testosterone concentration on sperm cryoresistance: the ibex as an experimental model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approval of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) was an important milestone, providing a wider range of treatment options and creating the possibility for drug switching after initiation.

This review aimed to summarise the current literature on the pattern of OAC switching in patients with AF, including reasons for switching and clinical consequences following switching. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase on Jun 27, 2020. We included 39 articles published after 2013, following the introduction of apixaban. The review found that switching among OACs was common in clinical practice, significantly varying with the type of OAC. Studies reporting the reason for switching and clinical outcomes were comparatively limited. The decision to switch was often related to safety issues (usually bleeding), poor anticoagulation control and ease-of-use. Patient characteristics, clinical conditions and drug interactions were found to be associated with switching from OACs. Findings regarding bleeding outcomes following switching were inconsistent, possibly confounded by the rationale for switching and the switching protocol. Noting the limited number of studies included and their relatively short follow-up periods, switching did not have a significant impact on the risk of stroke and other thrombotic outcomes.

Moreover, ruling out ACS in low-risk patients requires prolonged ED observationor overnight hospital admission to allow serialmeasurements of c-Tn, adding cost. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a novel marker of myocardial injury with putative advantages over cTn. Beingpresent in abundance in the myocellular cytoplasm, it is released rapidly (<1 hour) after onset of myocardial injury and could potentially play an important role in both earlier diagnosis of high-risk patients presenting early after CP onset, as well as in risk-stratifying low-risk patients rapidly.

We were interested to learn how the constraints of sequential lockdowns and social distancing measures had affected inpatients in a mental health setting, many of whom were already contending with significant restrictions on their freedom. Method We conducted structured interviews with 24 service users across the Low Secure and Locked Rehabilitation Division at St Andrews Healthcare Northampton. We interviewed male and female inpatients with diverse diagnoses including emotionally unstable personality disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia and offending behaviours. All participants were detained under the Mental Health Act throughout the pandemic. Service users were asked the following questions: How has the pandemic affected your mood? How has it affected your relationship with your family? How has it affected your treatment? How has the pandemic affected your leave? How has it affected how you use your free time? Are there any other ways the pandemic has affected you? We performed thematic analysis to identify ways the pandemic has affected service users. Result Four major themes were identified: Mental health Participants reported a decline in mood. Changing relationshipsService users reported that relationships with loved ones in the community had suffered from lack of contact and missing significant life events, however several participants felt that their relationships with peers had strengthened. 3) Delivery of care Responses were split on the increased reliance on technology to replace face-to-face interaction between patients and team members, with some respondents reporting this as 'less intimidating', while others found this isolating. Respondents reported reduced contact with MDT members and delays to recovery and step-down placements due to decreased leave. 4) Routine Respondents reported an increase in free time throughout the pandemic. Some used this to develop hobbies whereas others reported becoming lazy and expressed disappointment with the lack of exercise provision. Conclusion The pandemic has had significant emotional and psychological effects on society as a whole, but perhaps no group has been more affected than detained patients who have had their lives restricted to a massive degree. This group has been largely marginalised by government guidelines which often fail to consider individuals living in large group settings. By learning from the experiences of these service users we can adapt our practices to alleviate these issues in any future lockdowns and ensure our practices are the least restrictive possible.","output":"Patient experiences of the pandemic;exploring the effect of COVID-19 on patients detained under the Mental Health Act"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-associated activation of coagulation is not fully understood and appears to be different from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with sepsis. As the pathophysiology of coagulation in COVID-patients is unknown, it is uncertain whether unfractionated heparin (UFH), or anticoagulation in general, is effective in the attenuation of the procoagulant state. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of intravenous unfractionated heparin on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters in patients with COVID-19 and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study in 19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 and computed tomography (CT) scanning proven pulmonary embolism. According to the local protocol, repeated CT-scanning was indicated if no pulmonary improvement was present after a minimum of 7 days following start of anticoagulant treatment. We defined three endpoints: Laboratory markers (d-dimer at day 0 vs day 2), clinical success (resolution of PE at follow up CT scan or discharged alive from ICU) and radiological response (Qanadli index at follow up CT scan vs CT scan at diagnosis PE). Statistical tests used for analysis were a T-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Results: : Unfractionated heparin resulted in clinical success in at least 14 out of 19 patients. Pulmonary emboli were completely resolved on the follow up computed tomography scans in 5 out of 6 patients and partly resolved in the 6 th patient. D-dimer levels decreased on average from 7074 ng/mL to 4347 ng/mL (p=0.001) within 48 hours after start of heparin. Conclusion: In this observational study, we showed a rapid clinical, laboratory and radiological improvement in patients with COVID-19 and proven pulmonary embolism. Standard anticoagulant treatment was effective in this setting, supporting current guideline recommendations.","output":"Early Effects of Unfractionated Heparin on Clinical and Radiological Signs and D-dimer Levels in Patients With COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Embolism: an Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the Korean governments response to the pandemic on tobacco consumption and national smoking cessation services among the Korean population.

Also, in addition to the studys authors, nine experts were used for the models development and another ten for its assessment (19 total). From their in-depth interviews and subsequent content analysis, their input of the proposed STEAM-ification process was synthesized and the data analyzed. The results revealed that the VCLE design should begin with a face-to-face, classroom learning environment in which the gamification mechanisms were introduced and examined. This was then reinforced by moving the gamification process online outside of the classroom. Furthermore, five VCLE STEAM-ification steps were found to be particularly useful for enhancing creative thinking and student innovation. These included investigation, discovery, connections, creativity, and reflection. Moreover, we identified the gamification process as consisting of three main components. These were the game mechanics,' the game dynamics,' and player emotions. The ten experts agreed that the VCLE STEAM-ification creativity and innovation (C & I) process was appropriate at an excellent level ([Formula: see text] = 4.68, S.

We merge an epidemic SIS population model and a Solows type growth model, i.e. we propose a fusion between economics and epidemiology. We show the creation and the destruction of economic growth equilibria driven by the suppression policies and by the severity of the disease. The dynamic stability properties of the equilibria are mainly determined by (i) the stringency of the suppression policies, (ii) the proportion of infected workers, (iii) the recovery rate of workers, and (iv) the economys saving rate. Thus, economies can fall into the stable equilibrium of the poverty trap if the propensity to save is low and the economic policies that reduce the spread of infection are severe enough with high levels of infection and low rates of illness recovery. Otherwise, with high savings rates and if the suppression policies perform in such a way that infection levels are low and recovery rates are high, then the economies converge towards the equilibrium of high economic growth with capital accumulation. The scenario is rather complex since there is a multiplicity of equilibria such that economies can be in one scenario or another, characterized by stability or (structural) instability, i.e. bifurcation paths.

There is also a long-standing and concurrent rise in the prevalence and severity of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, the intersection between these two conditions needs to be carefully considered to ensure a more effective delivery of healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Generally, those with SUDs are more likely to have higher risk social determinants of health factors. Therefore, these patients are more likely to have barriers that can create difficulties in following appropriate infection control measures which in turn increases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2. In addition, these individuals have higher rates of medical comorbidities which increases the risk of all adverse outcomes, including mortality, from SARS-CoV2 infection. SUMMARY: Individuals with SUDs are at increased risk of both contracting SARS-CoV2 infection and suffering from worse outcomes afterwards. Though these risks of adverse outcomes are specific of SARS-CoV2 infection, the risk of exposure to other infectious diseases is increased in this population too. Healthcare providers and policymakers should then consider how to better protect this at-risk population and alleviate this increased disease burden.","output":"The effects of substance use on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection risks and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, medical schools have paused traditional clerkships, eliminating direct patient encounters from medical students education for the immediate future.

The initially small pore may subsequently dilate for full contents release, as commonly observed in amperometric traces. The size, shape and evolution of the pore is critical to the course of contents release, but exact fusion pore solutions accounting for membrane tension and bending energy constraints have not been available. Here we obtained exact solutions for fusion pores between two membranes. We find three families: a narrow pore, a wide pore and an intermediate tether-like pore. For high tensions these are close to the catenoidal and tether solutions recently reported for freely hinged membrane boundaries. We suggest membrane fusion initially generates a stable narrow pore, and the dilation pathway is a transition to the stable wide pore family. The unstable intermediate pore is the transition state that sets the energy barrier for this dilation pathway. Pore dilation is mechanosensitive, as the energy barrier is lowered by increased membrane tension. Finally, we study fusion pores in nanodiscs, powerful systems for the study of individual pores. We show that nanodiscs stabilize fusion pores by locking them into the narrow pore family. Significance During neurotransmission, hormone release and other fundamental processes, secretory vesicles fuse their membranes with target membranes to release contents through an initially small membrane fusion pore that subsequently dilates. Dilation is assisted by proteins such as SNAREs and synaptotagmin. While macroscopic soap film shapes are well characterized, finding exact solutions for microscopic cellular membrane surfaces is made more complex by bending energy constraints. Here, computational analysis revealed three families of fusion pores between two membranes. Our work suggests membrane fusion generates a member of the narrow pore family, and pore dilation is a transition to the wide pore family. The energy barrier that SNAREs or synaptotagmin must surmount to achieve dilation is set by a third unstable intermediate pore family.","output":"Three membrane fusion pore families determine the pathway to pore dilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has generated new experiences of intensive care.

To this end, this paper validated the idea of using an Internet of Things (IoT) system (a smartphone and the accompanying smartwatch) to monitor the working status in real-time so as to record the working pattern and nudge the user to have a behavior change. By using the accelerometer and gyroscope enclosed in the smartwatch worn on the right wrist, nine-channel data streams of the two sensors were sent to the paired smartphone for data preprocessing, and action recognition in real time. By considering the cooperativity and orthogonality of the data streams, a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) model was constructed to recognize the working status from a common working routine.

Mechanisms and consequences of painful symptoms related to ankle arthropathy have not been extensively studied. METHODS A consecutive sample of 30 adult PwH was included (60 ankles). Ankle structure was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (IPSG-MRI) and ultrasound (HEAD-US). The HJHS 2.1 assessed function of ankles and knees. Physical functioning was assessed with the Timed Up and Go test, the 2-Minute Walking Test and activity limitations with the HAL questionnaire. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Overall pain severity was examined using the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire and ankle pain intensity with a visual analogue scale. Pressure pain thresholds with an algometer assessed pain sensitivity. Spearman correlations were used to calculate interrelations between joint structure, function and pain. RESULTS Twenty-five PwH (83%) reported 1 painful joint, with 67% reporting the ankle as most painful joint. MRI-confirmed abnormalities were seen in 76% of talocrural and 55% of subtalar joints. HEAD-US abnormalities were seen in 93% of the ankles. A large variation was seen in pain sensitivity at the ankle. While moderate to high correlations were observed between ankle structure and HJHS, no meaningful correlations were found between MRI-scores and pain intensity or sensitivity.

Efforts to control the disease have only proven mildly successful, and the disease will likely continue to cause excessive fatalities until effective preventative measures (such as a vaccine) are developed. To develop disease management strategies, a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and population susceptibility to infection are needed. To this end, mathematical modeling can provide a robust in silico tool to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and the in vivo dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Guided by ACE2-tropism (ACE2 receptor dependency for infection) of the virus and by incorporating cellular-scale viral dynamics and innate and adaptive immune responses, we have developed a multiscale mechanistic model for simulating the time-dependent evolution of viral load distribution in susceptible organs of the body (respiratory tract, gut, liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, and brain). Following parameter quantification with in vivo and clinical data, we used the model to simulate viral load progression in a virtual patient with varying degrees of compromised immune status. Further, we ranked model parameters through sensitivity analysis for their significance in governing clearance of viral load to understand the effects of physiological factors and underlying conditions on viral load dynamics. Antiviral drug therapy, interferon therapy, and their combination were simulated to study the effects on viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2. The model revealed the dominant role of innate immunity (specifically interferons and resident macrophages) in controlling viral load, and the importance of timing when initiating therapy after infection.","output":"Innate Immunity Plays a Key Role in Controlling Viral Load in COVID-19: Mechanistic Insights from a Whole-Body Infection Dynamics Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The E484K mutation at the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein emerged independently in different variants around the world, probably as part of the ongoing adaptation of the virus to the human host, and has been widely associated with immune escape from neutralizing antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.

RESULTS: the classification of the health hazard allowance due to exposure to biological agents attributed to Nursing professionals is not in line with the factual situation experienced by them. CONCLUSION: it becomes necessary to broaden the discussion on the subject matter and to review the effective and fair compensation of Nursing professionals due to exposure to potentially contaminated biological agents in their work environments, given that the health hazard allowance is a workers right and is based on human dignity.","output":"Health hazard allowance for Nursing professionals: A reflective analysis under the principle of human dignity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of public health emergencies, health agencies need to engage and communicate with the public in real-time to share updates and accurate information. This is especially the case for the COVID-19 pandemic where public engagement can potentially save lives and flatten the curve. This paper considers how the use of interactive features and strategic network positions of health agencies on social media influenced their public engagement outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed 203 U.S. public health agencies' Twitter activity and the public engagement they received by extracting data from a large-scale Twitter dataset collected from January 21st to May 31st, 2020. Results show that health agencies' network position in addition to their two-way communication strategy greatly influenced the level of public engagement with their COVID-19 related content on Twitter. Findings highlight the benefits of strategic social media communication of public health agencies resides not only in how agencies use social media but also in their formation of network position to amplify their visibility. As official sources of health and risk information, public health agencies should coordinate their social media communication efforts to strategically position themselves in advantageous network positions to augment public engagement outcomes.","output":"How Public Health Agencies Break through COVID-19 Conversations: A Strategic Network Approach to Public Engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, the handling of biological samples from confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals demanded the use of inactivation protocols to ensure laboratory operators' safety. While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided into two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. These routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus-inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Arguably, shared guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be needed among the analytical community, yet deep investigations in this direction have not yet been reported. We here provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior to serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entails the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of a set of complementary analytical techniques: Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat treatment; however, it is accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the other hand, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (<150 nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected. This work represents a first step towards the identification of optimal serum inactivation protocols targeted to EVs analysis.","output":"Extracellular Vesicles Analysis in the COVID-19 Era: Insights on Serum Inactivation Protocols towards Downstream Isolation and Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Due to long working hours wearing an N95 mask and PPE kit during the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare workers (HCWs) complained of headaches, confusion, and exhaustion. This study was therefore performed to study the changes in brain oxygenation. Aim To compare brain oxygenation in health care workers wearing an N95 mask with a PPE kit versus a three-ply mask during an intensive care setting for 6 hours. Materials and Methods Thirty clinicians and 30 paramedical staff participated in the study. The control (three-ply mask) and subject (N95 mask with PPE) groups included 15 clinicians and 15 paramedical staff. A comparative analysis of brain oxygenation using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine was performed in these two groups at the beginning and the end of their work shift. Results The mean age of the individuals in the control and subject groups was 30.8 and 30.13 years, respectively. The median value of brain oxygenation in the control and subject groups in the pre-shift was between 33 and 31 and post-shift was 30 and 24. The drop in brain oxygenation in subjects was more than the controls ( p = 0.004) in the post-shift assessments. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) using arterial spin labeling (ASL) showed a rise in CBF in both groups post-shift as compared with the pre-shift values. The median values of the right and left MCA in the control and subject groups pre-shift were 82.75/83.45 and 89.75/106.65. The post-shift median values of both MCAs of the control and subject groups were 115.65/115.55 and 109.60/119.49. Conclusion MRI-BOLD imaging revealed a significant drop in brain oxygenation in the subject group as compared with the control group.

We have shown recently that in rat superior colliculus (SC) neurons adaptation to light acts as a local low-pass filter because, in contrast to the primate SC, in rat collicular neurons adaptation to small stimuli is largely limited to the vicinity of the adaptor stimulus. However, it was unclear whether large visual stimuli would induce the same spatially limited adaptation. We addressed this question by evaluating the effects of 1.8, 6.2 and 20.8 wide adaptor stimuli on test stimuli of variable size. Single unit recordings in the adult rat SC were employed to estimate the response amplitude. Small, 1.8 and 6.2 adaptors habituated visual responses only to stimuli smaller than the adaptive stimuli. However, the 20.8 adaptor dramatically reduced responses even to test stimuli >3 times wider than the adaptor (up to 70 wide). The latter result may be explained by a nearly complete occlusion by a large adaptor of the neuron's receptive field (RF). All these results are consistent with the idea of a limited spatial spread of adaptation in rat SC neurons that is the consequence of high convergence of retinal inputs, in which small RFs limit the spatial spread of adaptation. It is concluded that, in this limited spatial spread of adaptation, rodent SC resembles higher visual system areas in primates and indicates potential differences in visual information processing between rodents and primates.","output":"Limited Spatial Spread Explains the Dependence of Visual Response Adaptation on Stimulus Size in Rat Superior Colliculus Neurons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: E-learning is important in improving access to quality health sciences education.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal and spatial distributions of 3 infected families in a high-rise apartment building and examine the associated environment variables to verify the role of fecal aerosols. DESIGN: Epidemiologic survey and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses on throat swabs from the participants; 237 surface and air samples from 11 of the 83 flats in the building, public areas, and building drainage systems; and tracer gas released into bathrooms as a surrogate for virus-laden aerosols in the drainage system. SETTING: A high-rise apartment building in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 9 infected patients, 193 other residents of the building, and 24 members of the building's management staff. MEASUREMENTS: Locations of infected flats and positive environmental samples, and spread of virus-laden aerosols. RESULTS: 9 infected patients in 3 families were identified. The first family had a history of travel to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter Wuhan, whereas the other 2 families had no travel history and a later onset of symptoms. No evidence was found for transmission via the elevator or elsewhere. The families lived in 3 vertically aligned flats connected by drainage pipes in the master bathrooms. Both the observed infections and the locations of positive environmental samples are consistent with the vertical spread of virus-laden aerosols via these stacks and vents.

While stress hyperglycemia (StH) has been established as a risk factor for death in some critically ill cohorts, it is not a well-established risk factor for MV in COVID-19. The COVIDEastDM consortium pooled data from 5 academic hospitals on the East Coast of the US to study the relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19 outcomes. Data were obtained retrospectively from electronic records of adults with COVID-19 and either DM or StH (defined in this cohort as day-1 admission blood glucose >180 mg/dl and A1c <6.5%). This analysis included 3,435 individuals, of which 1,001 (29.1%) required MV and 748 (21.8%) died. The mean age was 67  15 yrs., BMI 30.4  7.7 kg/m2, A1c 7.98  2.21 % and glucose 184  104 mg/dl. Additionally, 57% were male, 4 % Asian,19% Black, 52% White, and 28% Hispanic. In a univariate analysis, risk factors for MV included younger age (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97, 0.99] per year older), male sex (OR 1.4 [1.2, 1.7]), BMI (OR 1.013 [1.003, 1.023] per kg/m2), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.16 [1.07, 1.28]) and the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (n=38) at admission (OR 3.9 [2.0, 7.5]). Patients with StH were more likely to require MV (OR 1.93, [1.10, 3.39]). In a multivariate analysis, this relationship was continuous, with both lower A1c and higher glucose increasing risk of MV (p< 0.01 for higher glucose, p<0.001 for lower A1c). Patients who required MV were more likely to die than those who did not require MV (OR 5.1, [4.3, 6.1]) and StH predicted mortality in the multivariate analysis. Thus, in patients hospitalized with COVID19 infection, StH is a strong predictor of both MV and death in COVID-19 infected adults. While it is unclear if StH is a cause or effect of severe COVID-19, its presence early in the hospital course identifies higher risk patients and could potentially impact management.","output":"Stress Hyperglycemia Predicts Mechanical Ventilation and Death in COVID-19 Infected Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundTests that can diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and predict prognosis would be significantly beneficial.

MethodsWe undertook a single centre prospective observational study in patients with COVID-19, other respiratory tract infections and healthy controls. Participants provided one breath sample for GC-IMS analysis. We used cross validation analysis to create models that were then tested against the original cohort data. Further multivariable analysis was undertaken to adjust for differences between the comparator groups. ResultsBetween 01/02/2021 and 24/05/2021 we recruited 113 participants, of whom 72 (64%) had COVID-19, 20 (18%) had another respiratory tract infection and 21 (19%) were healthy controls.

METHODS We performed a double-blind trial randomizing osteoarthritic knee patients undergoing unilateral TKA done by either using scalpel (group S) or cautery (group C). Primary outcomes were total blood loss calculated from maximum haemoglobin drop and blood loss collected in drain. Secondary outcomes were systemic inflammatory response (serum C-reactive protein), wound complications, and functional outcomes assessed over three months. RESULTS A total of 80 patients were recruited. Group S had similar calculated total blood loss compared to group C (1070 (S) vs 1128 (C) mL, 95% CI - 219 to 103, p = 0.47). There was no difference in the mean drain-collected blood loss between the two groups (443 (S) vs 486 (C) mL, 95% CI - 128 to 47, p = 0.36). Group C had higher serum C-reactive protein level at 48 hours after TKA compare to group S (105 vs 140 mg/dL, 95% CI - 66 to - 4, p = 0.03). Wound complications and functional outcomes at three months were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Using electric cautery does not reduce total blood loss as we thought it would be in primary TKA compare to scalpel only surgery and it is also associated with a greater systemic inflammatory response.

However, there is little research on the perceptions of audiology students regarding their competence and confidence following video otoscopic training, and how they view the use of video otoscopy as a teaching tool. Therefore, this study aimed to determine undergraduate (UG) audiology students perceived competence and confidence in conducting otoscopy following training by video otoscopic examination. METHODS: A survey methodology with a cross sectional design was employed. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to all third and fourth year (senior) (N = 79) UG audiology students using Survey Monkey. Ethical approval and permission from relevant stakeholders were obtained. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: 60 % of the students felt competent in performing otoscopy, while 63.3 % felt less competent in interpreting otoscopic examination findings. 43.3 % felt they can confidently and competently identify outer ear pathologies. There was no association between the number of video otoscopic examinations performed and perceived competence or/and confidence.

Infection rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations were calculated, as was vaccine effectiveness. Results: One hundred and eighty-four asymptomatic prisoners (50.3% vaccinated) and 33 staff were screened.

The development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy is critically needed. We have developed multiple serologic assays using newly designed SARS-CoV-2 reagents for detecting the presence of receptor-binding antibodies in sera. The first assay is surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based and can quantitate both antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocking to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in a single experiment. The second assay is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based and can measure competition and blocking of the ACE2 receptor to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with antispike antibodies. The assay is highly versatile, and we demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring antibody functionality of sera from small animals and nonhuman primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, we employ the assay to measure receptor blocking of sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The assay is shown to correlate with pseudovirus neutralization titers.

The trajectory of the global spread is worrisome, particularly in heavily populated countries such as Nigeria. The study objective was to assess and compare the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria and seven other countries during the first 120 days of the outbreak. METHODS: Data was extracted from the World Banks website. A descriptive analysis was conducted as well as modelling of COVID-19 spread from day one through day 120 in Nigeria and seven other countries. Model fitting was conducted using linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression methods (=0.05). RESULTS: The COVID-19 spread pattern in Nigeria was similar to the patterns in Egypt, Ghana and Cameroun. The daily death distribution in Nigeria was similar to those of six out of the seven countries considered. There was an increasing trend in the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. During the lockdown, the growth rate in Nigeria was 5.85 (R(2)=0.728, p< 0.001); however, it was 8.42 (R(2)=0.625, p< 0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed. The cubic polynomial model (CPM) provided the best fit for predicting COVID-19 cumulative cases across all the countries investigated and there was a clear deviation from the exponential growth model.

Hence, the grocery retailer and the customer must mutually agree on a time window during which the delivery can be guaranteed. This concept is referred to as the Attended Home Delivery (AHD) problem.

Current 2D culture methods are very limited in their ability to mimic the cancer cell environment. In recent years, various 3D models of cancer cells have been developed, notably in the form of spheroids/organoids, using scaffold or cancer-on-chip devices. However, these models have the disadvantage of not being able to precisely control the organization of multiple cell types in complex architecture and are sometimes not very reproducible in their production, and this is especially true for spheroids. Three-dimensional bioprinting can produce complex, multi-cellular, and reproducible constructs in which the matrix composition and rigidity can be adapted locally or globally to the tumor model studied. For these reasons, 3D bioprinting seems to be the technique of choice to mimic the tumor microenvironment in vivo as closely as possible.

These patterns occur due to antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) among serotype diseases, which leads to infection of secondary infectious classes. One example of this is dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which comprises the following four serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. The evolutionary vaccination game approach is able to shed light on this long-standing issue in a bid to evaluate the success of various control programs. Although immunization is regarded as one of the most accepted approaches for minimizing the risk of infection, cost and efficiency are important factors that must also be considered. To analyze the [Formula: see text] serovar aspect alongside ADE consequence in voluntary vaccination, this study establishes a new mathematical epidemiological model that is dovetailed with evolutionary game theory, an approach through which we explored two vaccine programs: primary and secondary. Our findings illuminate that the cost-efficiency effect for vaccination decision exhibits an impact on controlling [Formula: see text] serovar infectious diseases and should be designed in such a manner as to avoid adverse effects. Furthermore, our numerical result justifies the fact that adopting ADE significantly boosted emerging disease incidence, it also suggest that the joint vaccine policy works even better when the complex cyclical epidemic outbreak takes place among multi serotypes interactions. Research also exposes that the primary vaccine is a better controlling tool than the secondary; however, introducing a highly-efficiency secondary vaccine against secondary infection plays a key role to control the disease prevalence.","output":"Cost-efficiency analysis of voluntary vaccination against n-serovar diseases using antibody-dependent enhancement: a game approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESEARCH QUESTION: Does one foot patrol per day (15C20 min) conducted in serious violence harm spots reduce street-visible crime harm and frequency relative to no foot patrol in the same hot spots, and if so by how much? DATA: We identified 20 hot spots of 150m(2) each on the basis of community violence defined as serious assaults, robbery, and drug dealing in the Southend-on-Sea area of Essex Police, with boundaries geo-fenced to collect GPS measures of foot patrol presence generated by hand-held electronic trackers issued to officers directed to perform patrols. All street-visible crimes were counted for each of the 90 days of the experiment in each hot spot. METHODS: Daily random assignment of each hot spot to either control or treatment conditions (N = 90 X 20 = 1800 place-days) prescribed 720 place-days to receive extra patrols by Operational Support Group officers, which were compared to 1080 place-days with no extra patrols, using an intent-to-treat design, with 98% compliance with assigned treatments. Independent measures of other police presence in the area were tracked by the force-wide GPS telematics measures. All crimes were coded with the Cambridge Crime Harm Index for their CHI value. FINDINGS: The 20 harm spots comprised just 2.6% of the geographical area of the Southend-on-Sea area, with 41% of all its Cambridge CHI crime harm in the year preceding the experiment. Background patrol presence was about 2 min per day on control days and 1 min per treatment day. Crime harm scores for serious community violence were 88.5% lower on experimental days with extra patrols (mean = 1.07 CHI per treatment place-day) than without it (mean = 9.30 CHI per control place-day). Crime harm scores for all street-visible offences were 35.6% lower on treatment days (mean = 7.94 CHI per treatment place-day) than control days (mean = 12.33 CHI per control place-day), while the mean count of all street-visible offences was 31% lower on treatment days (mean count = 0.09 crimes per treatment place-day) than on control days (mean count = 0.13 crimes per control place-day). The estimated effect of the 720 days with 15-min patrols was to prevent crimes with recommended imprisonment of 3161 days, or 8.66 years. CONCLUSION: The use of two-officer foot patrol can be highly effective at preventing serious violence in street-visible settings in small areas in which such violence is heavily concentrated.","output":"Effects of One-a-Day Foot Patrols on Hot Spots of Serious Violence and Crime Harm: a Randomised Crossover Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explains the integrated implementation of a COVID-19 Feminist Framework (CFF) and biopsychosocial-spiritual perspective (BPSS-P) on the inclusive equitability of social service providers, practitioners, and policy-developers on global platforms.

However, it remains unclear if rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection differ between sampling methods. This study will compare the rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection by saliva, OPS, and NPS sampling in a public setting. METHODS Individuals referred for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing will be invited to participate in a prospective clinical study. They will have saliva, OPS and NPS specimens collected that will be analysed separately for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, OPS and NPS will be compared using a logistic regression mixed-effect model analysis. A sample of 19,110 participants is required at an expected 1.5% test-positive rate in order to detect a 25.6% difference. The total sample size will be adjusted as the test-positive rate changes.

When applied to portable suction, the design and testing standards lack clinical relevancy, which is evidenced by how available portable suction devices are sparingly used in pre-hospital situations. Lack of clinical relevancy despite being in accordance with design/manufacturing standards arise due to little if any collaboration between those developing clinical standards and the bodies that maintain design and manufacturing standards.

Thus, recent work has sought to identify behavioural characteristics that contribute disproportionately to individual variation in pathogen acquisition (super-receiving) or transmission (super-spreading). However, it remains unknown whether the same behaviours enhance both acquisition and transmission, a scenario likely to result in explosive epidemics. Here, we examined this possibility in an ecologically relevant host-pathogen system: house finches and their bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which causes severe conjunctivitis. We examined behaviours likely to influence disease acquisition (feeder use, aggression, social network affiliations) in an observational field study, finding that the time an individual spends on bird feeders best predicted the risk of conjunctivitis. To test whether this behaviour also influences the likelihood of transmitting M. gallisepticum, we experimentally inoculated individuals based on feeding behaviour and tracked epidemics within captive flocks. As predicted, transmission was fastest when birds that spent the most time on feeders initiated the epidemic. Our results suggest that the same behaviour underlies both pathogen acquisition and transmission in this system and potentially others. Identifying individuals that exhibit such behaviours is critical for disease management.","output":"Feeder use predicts both acquisition and transmission of a contagious pathogen in a North American songbird."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the development of the first mRNA vaccines used in humans.

Diagnosis of vaccine-associated myocarditis was made given the temporal relationship and supportive treatment initiated. Follow-up at 1 month confirmed complete symptomatic recovery and echocardiogram demonstrated normalization of cardiac function.

Moreover, with the pressure of zoos to become biological conservation mentors, zoos assume five roles as the executor of the relationship between society and nature. First, zoos take on the role of the model citizen by conveying a conservation message. They advocate for a sensible, sustainable use of natural resources and promote less wasteful, green-building alternatives. Many zoological institutions are developing organizational plans that include the use of solar, wind, and thermal power in their daily operations. Additionally, they are growing food for the animals, composting, and using recycled materials in their exhibit design. Second, zoos are maintaining a viable and genetically diverse collection. Zoos are managed under the premise that wildlife conservation is of foremost importance. As zoological institutions have become more active in field studies, their research findings are being applied to larger conservation efforts. Moreover, the conservation research that takes place in situ and ex situ is important in saving small fragmented wild populations. Third, zoos directly influence the attitudes and behaviors of the community in relation to the conservation of plants, animals, and habitats. Due to their urban locations within heavily populated cities, zoos have a unique geographic placement within the community. The urban location of zoos provides them with a unique opportunity to influence government policy. Fourth, the zoo is a conservation mentor. Through mentoring efforts, future generations of scientists and citizens will be more aware of the benefits of long-term conservation. As conservation mentors, zoos must lead the public to become citizen conservationist.

Although the seasonal coronaviruses do not pose a threat to human life, three members of this family, i.e., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently, SARS-CoV2, may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and lead to death. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has already caused more than 4.4 million deaths worldwide. Although much is better understood about the immunopathogenesis of the lung disease, important information about systemic disease is still missing, mainly concerning neurological parameters. In this context, we sought to evaluate immunometabolic changes using in vitro and in vivo models of hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that, besides infecting hamsters astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 induces changes in protein expression and metabolic pathways involved in carbon metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and synaptic transmission. Interestingly, many of the differentially expressed proteins are concurrent with proteins that correlate with neurological diseases, such as Parkinsonss disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntingtons disease. Metabolic analysis by high resolution real-time respirometry evidenced hyperactivation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Further metabolomics analysis confirmed the consumption of many metabolites, including glucose, pyruvate, glutamine, and alpha ketoglutarate. Interestingly, we observed that glutamine was significantly reduced in infected cultures, and the blockade of mitochondrial glutaminolysis significantly reduced viral replication and pro-inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in vivo as hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb of intranasally infected hamsters were positive for viral genome several days post-infection. Altogether, our data reveals important changes in overall protein expression, mostly of those related to carbon metabolism and energy generation, causing an imbalance in important metabolic molecules and neurotransmitters. This may suggest that some of the neurological features observed during COVID-19, as memory and cognitive impairment, may rely on altered energetic profile of brain cells, as well as an unbalanced glutamine/glutamate levels, whose importance for adequate brain function is unquestionable.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Impacts Carbon Metabolism and Depends on Glutamine for Replication in Syrian Hamster Astrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the effects of COVID-19, many changes are occurring in the daily life Breaking away from the temporal and spatial restrictions, the exercise method utilizing converged device in non-contact fashion is emerging In the present study, home training with utilization of the converged device for fall prevention and improvement of daily life in behalf of the frail elderly has been composed, and execution process designed Converged device-based exercise program extracted through Delphi analysis is composed of essential 8 types of motion reflecting the performance capability of the frail elderly as the subject, though easy, have been selected Converged device-based exercise program configured the system in a structure of subject, interface, and administrator for the purpose of utilizing this exercise program Overall execution process is composed 3 stages, and implemented with the elderly and the trainer being converged via medium For the overall implementation, the elderly performs the exercise program under leading of the trainer as the administrator Depending on the condition of the elderly as the subject, the trainer selects the difficulty of exercise, which the elderly performs and implements the exercise program while communicating with the trainer The converged device-based exercise program that is applicable to the elderly as a digitally vulnerable class is expected to bring about not only fall prevention and increased physical activities but also subsidiary effects of producing digital device-friendly environments for the elderly as a digitally vulnerable class ? 2021 River Publishers","output":"Development of converged device-based exercise program for preventing fall and increasing physical activity for the elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The establishment of national parks in Brazil has been made based on a history of conflicts with local populations living within the limits or buffer zones of protected areas.

METHODS: The authors conducted the study at 3 US dental schools and 1 US medical school using an online survey that assessed previous immunization behavior, attitudes about and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines, and personal experience with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 248 DS and 167 MS completed the survey. Forty-five percent of DS and 23% of MS were hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Results of bivariate analyses found that MS were 2.7 times more likely than DS to receive the vaccine (odds ratio, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.76 to 4.31; P = .0001). Although DS were more likely than MS (P < .05) to have had COVID-19 and to personally know someone who had COVID-19, MS were more likely to agree with mandates and trust information about the vaccines. In multivariable analyses, after controlling for demographic variables, experience with COVID-19, and personal vaccination behaviors, being a MS or DS was no longer predictive of willingness to get the vaccine.

The main pressure comes from the pandemic situation, but what makes it possible is a complex set of factors and innovative environments built along the times, which this manuscript aims to study. METHODS: Through an exploratory study within the scope of innovation management, the present manuscript aims to identify and explore factors that are promoting this accelerated development scenario. The method comprises the monitoring of the strategies adopted by the developers and other stakeholders, as regulatory and humanitarian agencies, specific mechanisms from governments and non-governments bodies, and the background technology that has paved this pathway. RESULTS: Technology-based and R&D strategy factors are the two main factors identified and explored herein. The breakthrough in the field of biotechnology and molecular biology is considered the main base-science that enables the rapid development of new vaccines. Additionally, new technological platforms can also be pointed out. Relating to R&D strategies, the parallelism of phases and adaptive clinical trials in consonance with regulatory agencies are the most relevant. CONCLUSIONS: The need to rapidly develop a vaccine against COVID-19 occurs at a time of great excitement in basic scientific understanding, as well as strategies learned in the past by industry and optimization of regulatory pathways. It is expected that these factors, arising from the global emergency, may redirect the R&D processes for new drugs, especially in times of pandemic.","output":"Analysis of the COVID-19 Vaccine Development Process: an Exploratory Study of Accelerating Factors and Innovative Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last decade has seen an unprecedented rise in the prevalence of chronic diseases worldwide. Different mono-targeted approaches have been devised to treat these multigenic diseases, still most of them suffer from limited success due to the off-target debilitating side effects and their inability to target multiple pathways. Hence a safe, efficacious, and multi-targeted approach is the need for the hour to circumvent these challenging chronic diseases. Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, has been under intense scrutiny for its wide medicinal and biological properties. Curcumin is known to manifest antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, antineoplastic, antifungal, and proapoptotic effects. A plethora of literature has already established the immense promise of curcuminoids in the treatment and clinical management of various chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. To date, more than 230 clinical trials have opened investigations to understand the pharmacological aspects of curcumin in human systems. Still, further randomized clinical studies in different ethnic populations warrant its transition to a marketed drug.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the usability and perceived usefulness of low-effort, in-the-moment self-tracking using simple instrumentation and to establish the amount of support needed when using this approach. METHODS: In this exploratory study, the One Button Trackera press-button device that records time stamps and durations of button presseswas used for self-tracking. A total of 13 employees of an academic medical center chose a personal research question and used the One Button Tracker to actively track specific subjectively experienced phenomena for 2 to 4 weeks. To assess usability and usefulness, we combined qualitative data from semistructured interviews with quantitative results from the System Usability Scale. RESULTS: In total, 29 barriers and 15 facilitators for using the One Button Tracker were found. Ease of use was the most frequently mentioned facilitator. The One Button Trackers usability received a median System Usability Scale score of 75.0 (IQR 42.50), which is considered as good usability. Participants experienced effects such as an increased awareness of the tracked phenomenon, a confirmation of personal knowledge, a gain of insight, and behavior change. Support and guidance during all stages of the self-tracking process were judged as valuable. CONCLUSIONS: The low-effort, in-the-moment self-tracking of subjectively experienced phenomena has been shown to support personal knowledge gain and health behavior change for people with an interest in health promotion.

The response of real estate markets to epidemic shocks is heterogeneous in community and city characteristics. Dynamic analysis shows that the declines in home prices, transaction volumes, and rents are all short-lived, returning to their original development paths a few months after the epidemic shock.

The cross-sectional design and convenience sampling (consisting of 111 unemployed participants) were used in the study. Findings revealed that psychological distress is moderately high for this group of unemployed people. Planning, acceptance, and active coping were the most frequently used problem-focused coping strategies, and self-distraction, self-blame, and venting were the most frequently used emotion-focused coping strategies reported by participants. Significant correlations were found among the participants psychological distress, problem-focused coping strategies, social support, financial strain, and sociodemographic characteristics. Higher duration of unemployment, financial difficulties and emotional-focused coping were associated with high psychological stress. On the other hand, older age, increased social support, and problem-focused coping were associated with lower psychological stress levels. These findings provide insight for a future practice involving the development of job loss interventions. The focus should be on identifying individuals at risk based on their characteristics, such as becoming relatively younger, unemployed for a longer time, having limited or no social support, a low level of personal coping resources, and inadequate financial resources. These interventions should seek to engage their social support network, bolster problem-focused coping strategies and financial resources.

We identified eight compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity from a library of 64 repurposed drugs and modeled at protease active sites by in silico docking. We demonstrate that Sitagliptin and Daclatasvir inhibit PLpro, and MG-101, Lycorine HCl, and Nelfinavir mesylate inhibit Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The X-ray crystal structure of Mpro in complex with MG-101 shows a covalent bond formation between the inhibitor and the active site Cys145 residue indicating its mechanism of inhibition is by blocking the substrate binding at the active site. Thus, we provide methods for rapid and effective screening and development of inhibitors for blocking virus polyprotein processing as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

Thirty individuals with BDD and 30 mentally healthy controls (HCs) completed 6 days of EMA (M = 8.54 assessments per day, N = 3075 assessments in total). Multilevel analyses revealed substantial intraindividual fluctuations of insight dimensions (across 30 min to hours) that were more pronounced for individuals with BDD than for HCs. Poorer insight correlated with higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and lower self-esteem at concurrent time points in the BDD group. Considering all predictors at the same time point, poorer insight was characterized by lower self-esteem and, partly, negative affect in the BDD group. Across time, self-esteem and insight influenced each other reciprocally, with comparatively stronger effects for the prediction of poorer insight by previously lower self-esteem. These findings demonstrate that insight is a highly variable phenomenon in BDD, further suggesting a clinically and etiologically relevant link between self-esteem and insight in symptom maintenance.

In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems. The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli. The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo. Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway. The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after airway lumenal delivery. Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells. In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung. Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by 2 logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures. To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP. SARS-CoV GFP replicated to similar titers as wild type viruses in Vero E6, MA104, and CaCo2 cells. In addition, SARS-CoV replication in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas reached similar titers to the human cultures by 72 hours post infection. Efficient SARS-CoV infection of ciliated cell-types in HAE provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV Replication and Pathogenesis in an In Vitro Model of the Human Conducting Airway Epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2021 Global Tuberculosis (TB) report shows slow progress towards closing the pediatric TB detection gap and improving the TB preventive treatment (TPT) coverage among child and adolescent contacts.

Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoVCmediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation.

Approximately one-third of pneumonia cases can be attributed to the pneumococcus. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) protect against colonisation with vaccine-type serotypes. The resulting decrease in transmission of vaccine serotypes leads to large indirect effects. There are limited data from developing countries demonstrating the impact of childhood PCV immunisation on adult pneumonia. There are also insufficient data available on the burden and severity of all-cause pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults from low resource countries. There is currently no recommendation for adult pneumococcal vaccination with either pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or PCVs in Mongolia. We describe the protocol developed to evaluate the association between childhood 13-valent PCV (PCV13) vaccination and trends in adult pneumonia. METHODS: PCV13 was introduced into the routine childhood immunisation schedule in Mongolia in a phased manner from 2016. In March 2019 we initiated active hospital-based surveillance for adult pneumonia, with the primary objective of evaluating trends in severe hospitalised clinical pneumonia incidence in adults 18 years and older in four districts of Ulaanbaatar. Secondary objectives include measuring the association between PCV13 introduction and trends in all clinically-defined pneumonia, radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and pneumonia associated with RSV or influenza. Clinical questionnaires, nasopharyngeal swabs, urine samples and chest radiographs were collected from enrolled patients. Retrospective administrative and clinical data were collected for all respiratory disease-related admissions from January 2015 to February 2019. DISCUSSION: Establishing a robust adult surveillance system may be an important component of monitoring the indirect impact of PCVs within a country. Monitoring indirect impact of childhood PCV13 vaccination on adult pneumonia provides additional data on the full public health impact of the vaccine, which has implications for vaccine efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Adult surveillance in Mongolia will contribute to the limited evidence available on the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia among adults in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, it is one of the few examples of implementing prospective, population-based pneumonia surveillance to evaluate the indirect impact of PCVs in a resource-limited setting.","output":"Evaluation of the impact of childhood 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction on adult pneumonia in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia: study protocol for an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States, using case fatalities from February 29, 2020 up to April 25, 2020, when some states began reversing their interventions. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, R(t), for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the models validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on R(t), and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing R(t) below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","output":"Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Kawasaki disease manifestations (MIS-C) has been recently reported in children with signs of recent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with covid-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with log rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed covid-19 in our center. Of them, 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. Another 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men. In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission (23.58%), with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT (9 patients out of 13) and ischemic stroke (8 patients out of 15), than in those with DVT (1 patient out of 20) or PE (7 patients out of 58).

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted that included patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic MICU with ALI/ARDS and confirmed influenza A infection, and all patients admitted with ALI/ARDS from any other etiology from September 2009 to March 2010. An itemized list of individual hospital charges was obtained for each patient from the hospital billing office and organized by billing code into a database. Continuous data that were normally distributed are presented as the mean  SD and were analyzed by the Students t test. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in proportions between patient subgroups. Data that were not normally distributed were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were studied: 23 in the H1N1 group and 22 in the noninfluenza group. Mean  SD age was similar (44  13 and 51  17 years, respectively, p = 0.15). H1N1 patients had lower APACHE III scores (66  20 vs. 89  32, p = 0.015) and had higher Pplat and PEEP on days 1, 3, and 14. Hospital and ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were comparable.

Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis. AIM AND METHODS: We aimed to measure the effect of ACEIs and/or ARBs on COVID-19 severe clinical illness by a meta-analysis. Literature search included all studies published since the COVID-19 outbreak began (December 2019) until May 9, 2020. We analyzed information from studies that included tested COVID-19 patients with arterial hypertension as comorbidity prior to hospital admission and history of taking ACEIs, ARBs, or ACEIs/ARBs. RESULTS: We included 16 studies that involved 24,676 COVID-19 patients, and we compared patients with critical (n = 4134) vs. non-critical (n = 20,542) outcomes. The overall assessment by estimating random effects shows that the use of ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with higher risk of in-hospital-death and/or severe illness among hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, effect estimate shows an overall protective effect of RAAS inhibitors/blockers (ACEIs, ARBs, and/or ACEIs/ARBs) with  23 % reduced risk f death and/or critical disease (OR: 0.768, 95%CI: 0.651-0.907, p=0.0018). The use of ACEIs (OR:0.652, 95%CI:0.478-0.891, p=0.0072) but not ACEIs/ARBs (OR:0.867, 95%CI:0.638-1.179, p =NS) or ARBs alone (OR:0.810, 95%CI:0.629-1.044, p=NS) may explain the overall protection displayed by RAAS intervention combined.

It was intended to explore the experience of doctors using tele-psychiatry for provision of clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mental Health Trust covering four cities in West Midlands, UK. Method The study was conducted as an anonymized questionnaire survey. A 10-item questionnaire was designed with items related to the clinical outcomes, challenges and provider satisfaction when using tele-psychiatry. It had mostly yes/no dichotomous responses along with the scope for making additional comments for each question. An online link of the questionnaire was sent via email to doctors of all grades working across the Black Country Healthcare NHS foundation Trust, in the West Midlands. The survey was open between July and October 2020;and monthly reminders were sent. Result The questionnaire was sent out to 159 doctors and 34 responded (response rate of 21.3%). Just over 50% had used both telephone and video consultations, whereas 47.1% responders had used telephone only. More than half (55.8%) reported that the tele-psychiatry affected clinical outcomes;and it was considered positive in around half (52.9%). Most (73.5%) of the responders found that limitations or challenges of using technology impacted on delivery of care remotely. However 64.7% psychiatrists were satisfied with the process overall;and 79.4% reported that they would like to use tele-psychiatry in the future as well. Survey captured many observations from the psychiatrists. Positive comments from the psychiatrists included expedited delivery of care, reduced non-attendance rates, as well as successful multidisciplinary meetings. Challenges in specific sub-specialties such as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry or Older Adult psychiatry were reported where complete assessments were not achieved successfully. The process was felt to be appropriate in general for stable or follow-up patients in comparison to new or acutely unwell patients. There was some worry expressed about missing out non-verbal cues which assist with mental state examination. Conclusion Inspite of a low response rate, the survey provided some understanding about the experience of doctors practicing tele-psychiatry during pandemic. While technological challenges were acknowledged, tele-psychiatry seemed to have been accepted by a majority of doctors who are also willing to continue it in their future clinical practice. There is a need to explore in a larger sample involving both patients and clinicians about the beneficial effects of tele-psychiatry that can be incorporated in the usual psychiatric practice.","output":"Experience of tele-psychiatry during COVID-19 amongst doctors working in a mental health trust: A survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactants are often completely invisible to us and yet they are present in almost every chemical that we use in our daily life.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. RESULTS: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (? = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (? = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (? = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression.

Most of these wastes are usually burnt or disposed in landfills without proper treatment which results in serious environmental issues by polluting water, air and soil. In the recent times, 'waste to wealth' is a fast-growing concept for environment friendly sustainable development. Utilization of the large amount of tea wastes for the production of low-cost adsorbents to reduce the expenses of water and wastewater treatment can be a sustainable way of management of these wastes which at the same time will improve circular economy also. This review endeavours to evaluate the potential of both raw and modified tea wastes towards the adsorption of pollutants from wastewater. The production of various adsorptive materials such as biochar, activated carbon, nanocomposites, hydrogels, nanoparticles from tea wastes are summarized. The advancements in their applications for the removal of different emerging contaminants from wastewater as well as potable water, air and soil are exhaustively reviewed. The outcome of the present review reveals that tea waste and its derivatives are appropriate candidates to be used as adsorbents that show tremendous effectiveness in cleaning the environment. This article will provide the readers with an in-depth knowledge on the sustainable utilization of tea waste as adsorbent materials and will assist them to explore this abundant cheap waste biomass for environmental remediation.","output":"Environmental remediation by tea waste and its derivative products: A review on present status and technological advancements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent behind the current COVID-19 pandemic having emerged in Wuhan China in late 2019 from a yet to be determined animal reservoir.

Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 and observed no definitive difference in furin cleavage between Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 in vitro. We performed functional assays using pseudo-typed particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed no significant differences between Wuhan-Hu1, Wuhan-Hu1 P681H or B.1.1.7 spike-carrying pseudo-typed particles in VeroE6 or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, despite the spikes containing P681H being more efficiently cleaved. Likewise, we or show no differences in cell-cell fusion assays using the spike P681H-expressing cells. Our findings suggest that while the introduction of P681H in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant may increase spike cleavage by furin-like proteases, this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.

Specifically, the citizens experiences in completing the PRO questionnaire and using the PRO data in consultations were examined. METHODS: The study was based on participant observations and semi-structured interviews and conducted at the Centre for Diabetes in Copenhagen and online. Participants were recruited deliberately to represent different cases of citizens with type-2 diabetes. Ten citizens were observed during consultation with an healthcare professional (HCP) and subsequently interviewed. The interviews were recorded as audio or video and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was performed on the basis of previously described guidelines. RESULTS: The PRO instigated reflections and enlightened citizens on disease-specific matters and motivated citizens to engage in self-management activities. During the citizen-HCP consultations, the PRO data prepared the actors before the meeting and enabled structured, effective and relevant conversations. However, the PRO questionnaire lacked response options, triggered citizen concerns about future health conditions and made them unsure if their answers were correct and aware that they lacked disease-specific knowledge. The experiences were linked to the citizens' situation as newly diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The informants found the PRO questionnaire and data meaningful and useful.

It is stimulated by mRNA structures inside the coding region. As the structure is unfolded repeatedly by consecutive translating ribosomes, whether it can refold properly each time is important in performing its function. By using single-molecule approaches and molecular dynamics simulations, we found that a frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot folds sequentially through its upstream stem S1 and downstream stem S2. In this pathway, S2 folds from the downstream side and tends to be trapped in intermediates. By masking the last few nucleotides to mimic their gradual emergence from translating ribosomes, S2 can be directed to fold from the upstream region. The results show that the intermediates are greatly suppressed, suggesting that mRNA refolding may be modulated by ribosomes. Moreover, masking the first few nucleotides of S1 favors the folding from S2 and yields native pseudoknots, which are stable enough to retrieve the masked nucleotides. We hypothesize that translating ribosomes can remodel an intermediate mRNA structure into a stable conformation, which may in turn stimulate backward slippage of the ribosome. This supports an interactive model of ribosomal frameshifting and gives an insightful account addressing previous experimental observations.","output":"Formation of frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknots is facilitated by remodeling of their folding intermediates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To conduct an early estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number (BRN) induced by government interference, and to project resulting day to day number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of deaths in a Danish setting.

We aimed to develop mathematical models that capture LMIC demographic characteristics such as young population and large household size and assess NPI effectiveness in rural and urban communities. Methods We constructed synthetic populations for rural, non-slum urban and slum settings to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. We integrated age mixing and household structure into contact networks for each community setting and simulated COVID-19 outbreaks within the networks. Using this agent-based model, we evaluate NPIs including testing and isolation, tracing and quarantine, and physical distancing. We explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic test, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. We performed extensive simulations to capture the uncertainty of outbreak trajectories and the impact of varying model parameters. Findings We found the impact of testing, tracing and distancing varies with rural-urban settings. In rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. Additionally, antibody rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis could be useful for mitigating the transmission. In non-slum urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In slum communities, we found physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and non-slum urban communities. Lastly, for all communities considered, we demonstrated contact quarantine is essential for effective containment and is effective at a low compliance rate (30%). Interpretation Our findings could guide setting-specific strategy design for different communities in LMICs.

Urolithiasis can lead to emergencies and affect renal function during long-term follow-up. Therefore, timely and appropriate treatment is essential. MAIN TEXT: This is a non-systematic review of the recently published recommendations regarding urolithiasis treatment options during COVID-19. Fourteen publications were the basis of our review. Regarding anesthesia methods, the optimal methods are still unknown. During COVID-19, most of the endo-urologists changed their routine clinical practice and elective surgical treatment approaches. Despite decreasing number of emergency visits and admissions for stone disease, patients tend to have leukocytosis, higher creatinine levels, increased grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis, and higher incidence of complications compared to non-COVID-19 time. Several alarming indications if present, intervention should be performed within 24 h to prevent irreversible kidney damage, disease progression, or even death. Some endo-urologists prefer definitive stone treatment over temporarily drainage to reduce the number of emergency room visits and hospital admissions, except if infection is present or staged treatment is planned. Several clinical scenarios of non-emergency and non-urgent urinary stones are present; thus, endo-urologists should appropriately weigh patients risk and surgery benefit to decide to the proper intervention time. If risks outweighed benefits to the patient, postpone the surgery. Renal colic should be managed with medical expulsive therapy and proper pain control with close follow-up just in case it becomes an emergency. Indwelling JJ stent removal or exchange is a matter of debate; some endo-urologists recommend removing, while others recommend postponing. CONCLUSION: Treatment options for urinary stones have markedly changed during COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal anesthesia methods are still unknown. Emergency intervention is a must if any alarming indications exist. Emergency cases tend to have higher incidence of complications compared to non-COVID-19 time. For non-emergency and non-urgent urolithiasis, endo-urologists should make judicious treatment decision to prioritize urolithiasis treatment, and they should weigh benefits and risks before surgery.","output":"Urolithiasis treatment options during COVID-19 pandemic: review of current recommendations and triage systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous impact on our daily lives, including the way people interact with buildings Leveraging the advances in machine learning and other supporting digital technologies, recent attempts have been sought to establish exciting smart building applications that facilitates better facility management and higher energy efficiency However, relying on the historical data collected prior to the pandemic, the resulting smart building applications are not necessarily effective under the current ever-changing situation due to the drifts of data distribution This paper investigates the bidirectional interaction between human and buildings that leads to dramatic change of building performance data distributions post-pandemic, and evaluates the applicability of typical facility management and energy management applications against these changes According to the evaluation, this paper recommends three mitigation measures to rescue the applications and embedded machine learning algorithms from the data inconsistency issue in the post-pandemic era Among these measures, incorporating occupancy and behavioural parameters as independent variables in machine learning algorithms is highlighted Taking a Bayesian perspective, the value of data is exploited, historical or recent, pre- and post-pandemic, under a people-focused view ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Does historical data still count?

Zymogens are usually activated by proteolytic cleavage. Many viruses encode proteases that execute key proteolytic steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a proof of concept for a therapeutic approach to fighting viral infections through eradication of virally infected cells exclusively, thus limiting virus production and spread. Using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we designed two HCV NS3 protease-activated zymogenized chimeric toxins (which we denote zymoxins). In these recombinant constructs, the bacterial and plant toxins diphtheria toxin A (DTA) and Ricin A chain (RTA), respectively, were fused to rationally designed inhibitor peptides/domains via an HCV NS3 protease-cleavable linker. The above toxins were then fused to the binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A in order to enable translocation into the mammalian cells cytoplasm. We show that these toxins exhibit NS3 cleavage dependent increase in enzymatic activity upon NS3 protease cleavage in vitro. Moreover, a higher level of cytotoxicity was observed when zymoxins were applied to NS3 expressing cells or to HCV infected cells, demonstrating a potential therapeutic window. The increase in toxin activity correlated with NS3 protease activity in the treated cells, thus the therapeutic window was larger in cells expressing recombinant NS3 than in HCV infected cells. This suggests that the zymoxin approach may be most appropriate for application to life-threatening acute infections where much higher levels of the activating protease would be expected.","output":"Engineered Toxins Zymoxins Are Activated by the HCV NS3 Protease by Removal of an Inhibitory Protein Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, is continuously spreading worldwide, creating a huge burden on public health and economy Currently, no specific vaccine or drug exists against SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19 Ayurveda, the oldest healing-schema of Traditional Indian Medicinal (TIM) system, is considered as a promising CAM therapy to combat various diseases and disorders To explore the regulatory mechanisms of 7,258 Ayurvedic herbs (AHs) against SARS-CoV-2, in this study, multi-targeting and synergistic actions of the constituent 34,472 phytochemicals (APCs) are investigated using a comprehensive approach comprising of network-pharmacology and molecular docking By evaluating 292 APCs having high-level of similarity with anti-viral drugs in DrugBank for their binding affinity against 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we develop and analyze a high confidence Bi-regulatory network of 115 APCs having ability to regulate protein targets in both virus and its host human-system Immunomodulatory prospects of the antiviral drugs alike potentially effective phytochemicals (PEPs) are presented as a special case study, highlighting the importance of 6 AHs (Zea mays, Cucurbita maxima, Pisum sativum, Thlaspi arvense, Calophyllum inophyllum, Ziziphus jujuba) in eliciting the antiviral immunity at initial stages of infection The mechanistic actions of PEPs against cardiovascular complications, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are also investigated to address the regulatory potential of Ayurvedic herbs in dealing with COVID-19 associated comorbidities The study further reports 12 PEPs as promising source of COVID-19 comorbidity regulators","output":"Extensive Exploration of Ayurvedic Herbs to Prioritize Anti-Viral Drugs Alike Phytochemicals Against SARS-CoV-2 Using Network Pharmacology (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Veillonella spp. rarely cause infections in humans.

Here, we analyze patient variables associated with the acceptance of a telemedicine encounter by a pediatric neurosurgical population during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS All patients seen in a single institution's outpatient pediatric neurosurgery clinic between 4/1/20 and 7/31/20 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic variables were collected for each patient's first completed encounter. Patients participating in telemedicine were compared to those seen in-person. Univariate analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fischer's exact test for categorical variables. A logistic regression multivariable analysis was then performed. RESULTS 682 patients were included (374 telemedicine and 308 in-person). Univariate analysis demonstrated telemedicine visits were more likely to occur at earlier study dates (p<0.001), be established rather than new patients (p<0.001), White or Caucasian (p<0.001), not Hispanic or Latino (p<0.001), English-speaking (p<0.001), non-Medicare/Medicaid recipients (p<0.001), have lower no show rates (p=0.006), and live further from the hospital (p=0.005). Multivariable analysis demonstrated older age (p=0.031), earlier appointment date (p<0.01), established patient status (p<0.001), English-speaking (p<0.02) and non-Medicare/Medicaid insurance (p<0.05) were significant predictors of telemedicine utilization.

Understanding the cause and effects of fatigue in the profession are warranted to design evidence-based and effective interventions for fatigue mitigation. By identifying the individual stressors to individuals fatigue levels, tailored approaches to better optimise performance can be established. Methods: This was a single-site qualitative study design using an interpretive, iterative and then deductive thematic analysis approach. Participants were recruited between February 2020CMay 2020. A convenience, followed by purposive sampling strategy was employed to inform theoretical gaps on surgical trainees and consultants. Findings: There are commonalities in the influencing factors between both fatigue and sleep deprivation. It was identified that often the combination of fatigue and sleep stressors blurs the line between identifying what is primarily influencing subjective fatigue. There was an appreciation that the perfect storm of personal and environmental stressors could impact patient safety. Participants identified several personal mitigators for technical and cognitive performance, but relied more heavily on team factors for decision-making and to mitigate affective issues. Conclusion: This study provides understanding of fatigue in surgery as a multifaceted phenomenon. Variation in causes and effects of fatigue are the norm. Maladaptive strategies to mitigate fatigue in surgery are commonly used.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey. SETTING: Four university hospitals in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients with IPF receiving antifibrotics for at least 3 months and with doctor appointment and/or scheduled routine blood analysis between March and May 2020 (the first 3 months after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey). INTERVENTIONS: Phone calls (a 5 min interview) were performed in June 2020. A questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale were applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients preferences for disease monitoring, patients attitudes and behaviours towards IPF, drug continuation, COVID-19 diagnosis and anxiety/depression status. RESULTS: The study included 115 patients with IPF (82 male; mean age, 68.437.44 years). Of the patients, 73.9% had doctor appointment and 52.2% had scheduled routine blood testing; 54.5% of patients with doctor appointment self-cancelled their appointments and 53.3% of patients with scheduled routine blood testing did not undergo testing. Of the patients, 32.2% were on nintedanib and 67.8% were on pirfenidone; self-initiated drug discontinuation rate was 22.6%. The percentage of patients communicating with their physicians was 35.7%. The route of communication was by phone (34.8%). The frequency of depression and anxiety was 27.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The rates of drug discontinuation (35.1% vs 16.7%, p<0.05) and depression (37.8% vs 21.8%, p=0.07) were higher in nintedanib users than in pirfenidone users.

Severe complications are observed only in a small proportion of infected patients but the cellular mechanisms underlying this progression are still unknown. Comprehensive flow cytometry of whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients reveals a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils. This increase strongly correlates with disease severity and is associated with elevated IL-6 and IP-10 levels, two key players in the cytokine storm. The most pronounced decrease in cell counts is observed for CD8 T-cells and VD2 æ T-cells, which both exhibit increased differentiation and activation. ROC analysis reveals that the count ratio of immature neutrophils to VD2 (or CD8) T-cells predicts pneumonia onset (0.9071) as well as hypoxia onset (0.8908) with high sensitivity and specificity.

Despite this, they are sometimes criticised for being insufficiently rigorous to meaningfully inform clinical practice or research design. Reporting checklists are a useful tool to improve rigour in research and, although case report checklists have previously been developed, no existing checklist focuses on the peri-operative setting. In order to address the need for a case reports checklist that better accommodates peri-operative care, we used an established tool as the basis for developing the 12-item Anaesthesia Case Report checklist. This was refined using an iterative approach through feedback from journal editors with experience of handling case reports, patient and public involvement, and trialling its use on Anaesthesia Reports submissions. The Anaesthesia Case Report checklist differs from existing checklists by aligning with peri-operative practice; it places less emphasis on making diagnoses and focuses on the way in which clinical challenges, for example, related to the patient's comorbidities or operative interventions, are addressed. Adopting a standardised approach to the content of case reports presents clear benefits to authors, editors and peer reviewers through streamlining the processes involved in writing and publication. The Anaesthesia Case Report checklist provides a pragmatic framework for comprehensive and transparent reporting.

The results of the study were obtained using qualitative (method of discussions in focus groups) and quantitative methods (survey) of sociological research, logical and statistical analysis. The representativeness of the data was ensured by a sufficient sample size including 1194 consumers (with confidence probability = 0.95 and confidence interval  0.05). RESULTS: The number of respondents fully supporting the legalisation of online trade in medicines increased. Consumer attitudes towards online commerce depend on the age group of the respondents. 1.5 times more respondents over 46 years (12.1%) are strongly against distance selling of medicines compared to survey participants aged 18 to 25 years (7.8%).

According to this model a metastable trimer, anchored in the viral membrane through its transmembrane domain, transits to a trimeric prehairpin intermediate, anchored at its opposite end in the target membrane through its fusion peptide. A subsequent refolding event creates a trimer of hairpins (often termed a six-helix bundle) in which the previously well-separated transmembrane domain and fusion peptide (and their attached membranes) are brought together, thereby driving membrane fusion. While there is ample biochemical and structural information on the trimer-of-hairpins conformation of class I viral fusion proteins, less is known about intermediate states between native metastable trimers and the final trimer of hairpins. In this study we analyzed conformational states of the transmembrane subunit (TM), the fusion subunit, of the Env glycoprotein of the subtype A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A). By analyzing forms of EnvA TM on mildly denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels we identified five conformational states of EnvA TM. Following interaction of virions with a soluble form of the ASLV-A receptor at 37 degrees C, the metastable form of EnvA TM (which migrates at 37 kDa) transits to a 70-kDa and then to a 150-kDa species. Following subsequent exposure to a low pH (or an elevated temperature or the fusion promoting agent chlorpromazine), an additional set of bands at >150 kDa, and then a final band at 100 kDa, forms. Both an EnvA C-helix peptide (which inhibits virus fusion and infectivity) and the fusion-inhibitory agent lysophosphatidylcholine inhibit the formation of the >150- and 100-kDa bands. Our data are consistent with the 70- and 150-kDa bands representing precursor and fully formed prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM. Our data are also consistent with the >150-kDa bands representing higher-order oligomers of EnvA TM and with the 100-kDa band representing the fully formed six-helix bundle. In addition to resolving fusion-relevant conformational intermediates of EnvA TM, our data are compatible with a model in which the EnvA protein is activated by its receptor (at neutral pH and a temperature greater than or equal to room temperature) to form prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM, and in which subsequent exposure to a low pH is required to stabilize the final six-helix bundle, which drives a later stage of fusion.","output":"Sequential roles of receptor binding and low pH in forming prehairpin and hairpin conformations of a retroviral envelope glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new epidemiological scenario has so far focused on the environmental circulation of human viral pathogens.

We thus also speculated that there might be an effect on viral viability, which has never been tested. To evaluate such activity, we chose human adenovirus (HAdV), which is representative of waterborne viruses. We conducted experiments using HAdV serotype 5, whose titer was determined by infecting HeLa cell cultures.

Patients conducted moderate continuous (MCT, n = 24, mean age 70.3  10.1 years) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n = 22, mean age 63.6  12.6 years). The intensity of training was monitored with the BORG CR10 scale (intense phases  7/10 and moderate phases  4/10 points). The primary outcome was improvement (?-values) of six-minute-walk-test (6 MWT), while the secondary outcomes were improvement of vital capacity (VC(max)), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) and functional capabilities (functional independence assessment measure, FIM/FAM and Barthel scores) after 3 weeks of training. No adverse events were observed. There was a trend towards a greater improvement of 6 MWT in HIIT than MCT (159.5  64.9 m vs. 120.4  60.4 m; p = .057), despite more days of invasive ventilation (39.6  16.8 days vs. 26.8  16.2 days; p = .009).

Contact tracing and case isolation are common methods for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. However, the effectiveness of any contact tracing system rests on public engagement. Numerous factors may influence an individuals willingness to engage with a contact tracing system. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To identify facilitators and barriers to uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. METHOD: A rapid systematic review was conducted to identify papers based on primary research, written in English, and that assessed facilitators, barriers, and other factors associated with the uptake of, and engagement with, a contact tracing system. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four themes were identified as facilitators to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: collective responsibility; personal benefit; co-production of contact tracing systems; and the perception of the system as efficient, rigorous and reliable. Five themes were identified as barriers to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: privacy concerns; mistrust and/or apprehension; unmet need for more information and support; fear of stigmatization; and mode-specific challenges. CONCLUSIONS: By focusing on the factors that have been identified, contact tracing services are more likely to get people to engage with them, identify more potentially ill contacts, and reduce transmission.","output":"Facilitators and barriers to engagement with contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks: A rapid review of the evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has compelled many organizations to implement full-time telework for their employees in a bid to prevent a transmission of the virus. At the same time, the volatile COVID-19 situation presents unique, unforeseen daily disruptive task setbacks that divert employees' attention from routinized work tasks and require them to respond adaptively and effortfully. Yet, little is known about how telework employees react to such complex demands and regulate their work behaviors while working from home. Drawing on Hobfoll's (1989) conservation of resources (COR) theory, we develop a multilevel, two-stage moderated-mediation model arguing that daily COVID-19 task setbacks are stressors that would trigger a resource loss process and will thus be positively related to the employee's end-of-day emotional exhaustion. The emotionally exhausted employee then enters a resource preservation mode that precipitates a positive relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behaviors. Based on COR, we also predict that the relation between daily COVID-19 task setbacks and exhaustion would be more positive in telework employees who have higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with coworkers, but organizations could alleviate the positive relation between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior by providing employees with higher (vs. lower) telework task support. We collected daily experience-sampling data over 10 workdays from 120 employees (Level 1, n = 1,022) who were teleworking full-time due to the pandemic lockdown. The results generally supported our hypotheses, and their implications for scholars and managers during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants, which convert waste into heat and energy, can contribute to the circular economy by utilizing types of waste that cannot be recycled. Due to the varying quality of sorting and socio-economic conditions in individual regions, the waste composition differs between regions and has an uncertain future development. Waste composition significantly affects the operation of WtE plants due to differences in energy potential. This paper supports strategic capacity planning for waste energy recovery by introducing a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model that captures waste composition uncertainty through scenarios of possible future development. The results of the model provide insights into the economics of operation and identify important factors in the sustainability of the waste handling system. The model is demonstrated on an instance with six scenarios for waste management in the Czech Republic for the year 2030. The solution of the proposed model is to build 14 new WtE plants with a total capacity of 1970 kt in addition to the four existing plants with a capacity of 831 kt.

In addition, the existing traditional medicines have to be continuously improved, which is also the case with Western scientific medicines. Whereas one school of thought supports the idea of improving medicines, be they traditional or Western, through scientific research, an opposing school of thought argues that subjecting African traditional medicines to scientific research would be tantamount to some form of colonization and imperialism.

The present study was performed to explore the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (SGp RBD) of the three variants (Omicron, Delta, and WT) with the receptor hACE2. The structural changes occurred in Omicron due to the mutations at key positions improved the ability to mediate SARS-CoV-2 viral infection compared to other VoCs. The phytochemicals limonin and glycyrrhizic acid were docked with the SGp RBD of the variants WT, Delta and Omicron. The computed dock score revealed that limonin and glycyrrhizic acid binds effectively at the SGp RBD of all three variants, and showed almost similar binding affinity at the binding interface of ACE2. Therefore, despite the multiple mutations occurred in Omicron and its viral transmission is comparatively high, the computed binding affinity of the phytochemicals limonin and glycyrrhizic acid supported that the traditional medicines can be useful in formulating adjuvant therapies to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron.","output":"Computational studies on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron SGp RBD with human receptor ACE2, limonin and glycyrrhizic acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning has given access to education for diverse populations including students with disabilities.

Precision medicine (PM) is the most advanced scientific form of medical practice and seeks to gather data from the genome, environmental interactions, and lifestyles. Relating to trauma, PM promises to significantly advance our understanding of the factors that contribute to the physiologic response to injury. METHODS: We review the status of PM-driven trauma care. Semantic-based methods were used to gather data on genetic/epigenetic variability previously linked to the principal causes of trauma-related outcomes. Data were curated to include human investigations involving genomics/epigenomics with clinical relevance identifiable early after injury. RESULTS: Most studies relevant to genomic/epigenomic differences in trauma are specific to traumatic brain injury and injury-related sepsis. Genomic/epigenomic differences rarely encompass other relevant factors, such as coagulability and pharmacogenomics. Few studies describe clinical use of genomics/epigenomics for therapeutic intervention in trauma care, and even fewer attempt to incorporate real-time genomic/epigenomic information to precisely guide clinical decision-making. CONCLUSION: Considering that genomics/epigenomics, environmental exposures, and lifestyles are most likely to be of significant medical relevance in advancing the field of trauma, the lack of application of concepts and methodologies from PM to trauma education, research, practice, and community wellness is underwhelming. We suggest that significant effort be given to incorporate the tools of what is becoming the new medicine.","output":"Precision medicine in trauma: a transformational frontier in patient care, education, and research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently embroiled in a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by the novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The severity of COVID-19 disease ranges from asymptomatic to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. In few patients, the disease undergoes phenotypic differentiation between 7 and 14 days of acute illness, either resulting in full recovery or symptom escalation. However, the mechanism of such variation is not clear, but the facts suggest that patient's immune status, comorbidities, and the systemic effects of the viral infection (potentially depending on the SARS-CoV-2 strain involved) play a key role. Subsequently, patients with the most severe symptoms tend to have poor outcomes, manifest severe hypoxia, and possess elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?3, and TNF-&#945;) along with elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, marked lymphopenia, and elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. Based on the available evidence, we propose a mechanism wherein SARS-CoV-2 infection induces direct organ damage while also fueling an IL-6-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and hypoxia, resulting in escalating systemic inflammation, multi-organ damage, and end-organ failure. Elevated IL-6 and hypoxia together predisposes patients to pulmonary hypertension, and the presence of asymptomatic hypoxia in COVID-19 further compounds this problem.

Zoonoses, in particular, represent the 60% of emerging diseases, and are a big challenge for public health due to the complexity of their dynamics. Mathematical models, by allowing an a priori analysis of dynamic systems and the simulation of different scenarios at once, may represent an efficient tool for the determination of factors and phenomena involved in zoonotic infection cycles, but are often underexploited in public health. In this context, we developed a deterministic mathematical model to compare the efficacy of different intervention strategies aimed at reducing environmental contamination by macroparasites, using raccoons (Procyon lotor) and their zoonotic parasite Bayilsascaris procyonis as a model system. The three intervention strategies simulated are raccoon depopulation, anthelmintic treatment of raccoons and faeces removal. Our results show that all these strategies are able to eliminate the parasite egg population from the environment, but they are effective only above specific threshold coverages. Host removal and anthelmintic treatment showed the fastest results in eliminating the egg population, but anthelmintic treatment requires a higher effort to reach an effective result compared to host removal. Our simulations show that mathematical models can help to shed light on the dynamics of communicable infectious diseases, and give specific guidelines to contain B. procyonis environmental contamination in native, as well as in new, areas of parasite emergence. In particular, the present study highlights that identifying in advance the appropriate treatment coverage is fundamental to achieve the desired results, allowing for the implementation of cost- and time-effective intervention strategies.","output":"How to choose the best control strategy?

For decades, efforts have been focused on finding a universal treatment that could be applied to all patients with practice recommendations varying between intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) and surgical drainage. However, despite medical advances, the incidence of empyema has increased, suggesting a gap in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and insufficient crosstalk between clinical practice and preclinical research, which slows the development of innovative, personalized therapies. The recent trend towards less invasive treatments in advanced stage empyema opens new opportunities for pharmacological interventions. Its remarkable efficacy in pediatric empyema makes IPFT the first line treatment. Unfortunately, treatment approaches used in pediatrics cannot be extrapolated to empyema in adults, where there is a high level of failure in IPFT when treating advanced stage disease. The risk of bleeding complications and lack of effective low dose IPFT for patients with contraindications to surgery (up to 30%) promote a debate regarding the choice of fibrinolysin, its dosage and schedule. These challenges, which together with a lack of point of care diagnostics to personalize treatment of empyema, contribute to high (up to 20%) mortality in empyema in adults and should be addressed preclinically using validated animal models. Modern preclinical studies are delivering innovative solutions for evaluation and treatment of empyema in clinical practice: low dose, targeted treatments, novel biomarkers to predict IPFT success or failure, novel delivery methods such as encapsulating fibrinolysin in echogenic liposomal carriers to increase the half-life of plasminogen activator. Translational research focused on understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that control 1) the transition from acute to advanced-stage, chronic empyema, and 2) differences in outcomes of IPFT between pediatric and adult patients, will identify new molecular targets in empyema.

The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections and mortality counts are compounded by geographic heterogeneity of the population. This complicates prediction, particularly when using models assuming well-mixed populations. To address this problem, we account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SE(A)IR models, i.e., modified SEIR models that include infectious asymptomatic individuals. The model parameters account for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission mostly via human-to-human contact, and the fact that contact frequency among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. The probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from communities where the infection is already present, thus each node is characterized by its internal contact and by its connectivity with other nodes. Census data are used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can be modified to simulate changes in mitigation measures. Our network SE(A)IR model depends on easily interpretable parameters estimated from available community level data. The parameters estimated with Bayesian techniques include transmission rate and the ratio asymptomatic to symptomatic infectious individuals. The methodology predicts that the latter quantity approaches 0.5 as the epidemic reaches an equilibrium, in full agreement with the May 22, 2020 CDC modeling. The network model gives rise to a spatially distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas. The time courses of the infected cohorts in the different counties predicted by the network model are remarkably similar to the reported observations. Moreover, the model shows that monitoring the infection prevalence in each county, and adopting local mitigation measures as infections climb beyond a certain threshold, is almost as effective as blanket measures, and more effective than reducing inter-county mobility.","output":"Metapopulation Network Models for Understanding, Predicting, and Managing the Coronavirus Disease COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the reasons for the differences in the spread of COVID-19 in different cities of China is important for future epidemic prevention and control. This study analyzed this issue from the perspective of population migration from Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China). It reveals that population outflow from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei Province (the province where Wuhan is located) and metropolises and provincial capitals outside of Hubei province exceeded those to other cities. This is broadly consistent with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Additionally, model analysis revealed that population outflow from Wuhan was the key factor that determined the COVID-19 situations. The spread of COVID-19 was positively correlated with GDP per capita and resident population and negatively correlated with the distance from Wuhan and the number of hospital beds, while population density was not a strong influential factor. Additionally, the demographic characteristics of population migration from Wuhan also affected the virus transmission. Particularly, businesspeople (who tend to have a high frequency of social activities) were more likely to spread COVID-19. This study indicated that specific measures to control population outflow from the epicenter at the early stage of the epidemic were of great significance.","output":"What Are the Reasons for the Different COVID-19 Situations in Different Cities of China?

Although well studied in Europe, no studies have been conducted with forestry workers in the Northeastern United States since 1990s. METHODS: Full\\\\time forestry workers and two comparison groups (volunteer firefighter/first responders and indoor/healthcare workers) within New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Regions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were recruited for this cross\\\\sectional seroprevalence study. Blood draws were conducted to test for antibodies to Lyme, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis. Surveys were administered to determine personal risk factors and protective behaviors. RESULTS: Between November 2020 and May 2021, 256 (105 forestry, 101 firefighter/first responder, and 50 indoor/healthcare) workers participated in this study. Forestry workers had a probability of testing positive nearly twice as high for any tick\\\\borne disease (14%) compared to firefighter/first responders (8%) and to indoor workers (6%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .140).

Using the nucleic acid sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 nonvariant and a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 variant-carrying plasmid, a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationCtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method based on the single-base mass probe extension of multiplex PCR amplification products was established to detect 9 mutation types in 7 mutated sites (HV6970del, N501Y, K417N, P681H, D614G, E484K, L452R, E484Q, and P681R) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Twenty-one respiratory tract pathogens (9 bacteria and 12 respiratory viruses) and nucleic acid samples from non-COVID-19 patients were selected for specific validation. Twenty samples from COVID-19 patients were used to verify the accuracy of this method. The 9 mutation types could be detected simultaneously by triple PCR amplification coupled with MALDI-TOF MS. SARS-CoV-2 and six variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), could be identified. The detection limit for all 9 sites was 1.5  10(3) copies. The specificity of this method was 100%, and the accuracy of real-time PCR cycle threshold (C(T)) values less than 27 among positive samples was 100%. This method is open and extensible, and can be used in a high-throughput manner, easily allowing the addition of new mutation sites as needed to identify and track new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge. mPCR-MS minisequencing provides a new detection option with practical application value for SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection. IMPORTANCE The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is the key factor in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. An all-in-one SARS-CoV-2 variant identification method based on a multiplex PCR-mass spectrometry minisequencing system was developed in this study. Six SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, Epsilon, Iota, Gamma, and Delta) can be identified simultaneously. This method can not only achieve the multisite simultaneous detection that cannot be realized by PCR coupled with first-generation sequencing technology and quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology but also avoid the shortcomings of time-consuming, high-cost, and high technical requirements of whole-genome sequencing technology. As a simple screening assay for monitoring the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and variants, mPCR-MS minisequencing is expected to play an important role in the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a supplementary technology.","output":"A Novel Strategy for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Based on Multiplex PCR-Mass Spectrometry Minisequencing Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and the first cases were officially identified around December 8, 2019. Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using open-source data. METHODS: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu. RESULTS: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31, 2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship, given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22 was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting that the infection was present prior to December.","output":"Using Open-Source Intelligence to Detect Early Signals of COVID-19 in China: Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safe and efficient drugs to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic are urgently needed. In this context, we have analyzed the anti-coronavirus potential of the natural product glycyrrhizic acid (GLR), a drug used to treat liver diseases (including viral hepatitis) and specific cutaneous inflammation (such as atopic dermatitis) in some countries. The properties of GLR and its primary active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid are presented and discussed. GLR has shown activities against different viruses, including SARS-associated Human and animal coronaviruses. GLR is a non-hemolytic saponin and a potent immuno-active anti-inflammatory agent which displays both cytoplasmic and membrane effects. At the membrane level, GLR induces cholesterol-dependent disorganization of lipid rafts which are important for the entry of coronavirus into cells. At the intracellular and circulating levels, GLR can trap the high mobility group box 1 protein and thus blocks the alarmin functions of HMGB1. We used molecular docking to characterize further and discuss both the cholesterol- and HMG box-binding functions of GLR. The membrane and cytoplasmic effects of GLR, coupled with its long-established medical use as a relatively safe drug, make GLR a good candidate to be tested against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, alone and in combination with other drugs. The rational supporting combinations with (hydroxy)chloroquine and tenofovir (two drugs active against SARS-CoV-2) is also discussed.

METHODS: Data pertaining to patients who required ECMO support between 2018 and 2019 were reviewed. ECMO staffing costs were estimated based on national trends and modelled by annual utilization and case volume. A break-even point was derived from a comparison between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led models. For each scenario, direct medical costs were calculated based on utilization which was in turn defined by \\"low\\" (4 days), \\"average\\" (10 days), and \\"high\\" (30 days) duration of time spent on ECMO. RESULTS: Within the time frame, there was a total of 107 ECMO cases with a mean ECMO duration of 11 days, within the study time frame.

In contrast, early and information-focused actions have had bigger effects. Event studies show that first case announcements, emergency declarations, and school closures reduced mobility by 1-5% after 5 days and 7-45% after 20 days.

In the obstetric setting, births cannot be postponed, and maternity staff had to adapt to assure obstetric safety while balancing evidence-based standards with the new challenges posed by the pandemic.

We followed the evidence-based approach described by Arksey & OMalley: we searched several databases for English and German articles published between January 2020 and January 2021 that discussed or touched upon the effects the pandemic had on maternity staff in OECD countries and China.We found that structural challenges caused by the crisis and its subjective effects on maternity staff fell into two main topic areas. Structural challenges (the first main topic) were divided into five subtopics: staff shortages and restructuring;personal protective equipment and tests;switching to virtual communication;handling women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection;and excluding accompanying persons. The pandemic also strongly affected the staffs mental health (the second main topic.) Attempting to meet challenges posed by the pandemic while afraid of contamination, suffering overwork and exhaustion, and struggling to resolve ethical-moral dilemmas had severe negative subjective effects. Several studies indicated increased depression, anxiety, stress levels, and risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms, although the crisis also generated strong occupational solidarity.Care for pregnant, birthing, and breast-feeding women cannot be interrupted, even during a pandemic crisis that requires social distancing. Maternity staff sometimes had to abandon normal standards of obstetric care and were confronted with enormous challenges and structural adjustments that did not leave them unscathed: their mental health suffered considerably.

By increasing the patient's breathing rate to induce fast shallow-breathing (FSB) with the aid of a metronome, our hypothesis was that the motion magnitude of the target would be minimized with no physical contact and compression. Materials/Methods Ten SBRT patients who were treated under FSB were selected for this study: 4 lung and 6 liver cases. Our proposed method is called shallow kinetics induced by metronome (SKIM). We have used a metronome by setting the beats-per-minute (BPM) in the range of 50C60 to induce the SB. This corresponded to a patient breathing rate of 25C30 (breathing) cycles-per-minute. Two 4DCT scans, free-breathing (FB) and SKIM, were acquired and exported to commercially available software. Subsequently, the motion magnitude of the target in a superior-to-inferior direction was measured in each data set and compared. Results The respiratory motion was greatly reduced when using SKIM. The mean  standard deviation (SD) values of motion magnitude of the target in FB and SKIM across patients were 1.65  0.93 cm and 0.76  0.20 cm, respectively. Among these cases, the mean BPM setting of the metronome was 55.2. Conclusion Compared with FB, the SKIM technique could significantly reduce the respiratory motion magnitude of thoracic and abdominal targets. Our proposed method can be an excellent practical alternative to the conventional compression methods due to its flexibility and ease of implementation, especially during a global pandemic when minimal physical contact is crucial for the safety of both patients and care providers.

These strategies should be multidisciplinary, personalised interventions, performed in appropriate settings along a healthcare continuum from inpatient to community care. Personalisation, and the complexity of levels of care and interventions make evaluation of treatments difficult. The present study aims to measure the effectiveness of a complex treatment programme for EDs which includes hospitalisation, day hospital and outpatient settings. Our purpose is to assess the complete therapeutic process of each patient through all these levels of care, capturing the multiplicity of trajectories that a programme of these characteristics involves. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a multicentre, naturalistic, observational study. All patients starting between November 2017 and October 2020 in a healthcare network for EDs in Spain are being invited to participate. The first phase of intensive change monitoring to November 2020 is followed by lower intensity follow-up until October 2025. In the first phase progress of all participants is assessed every 3 weeks using specific measures for ED and the Clinical Outcomes Routine Evaluation system, a family of instruments specifically designed to measure change in psychotherapy. In the second phase data collection will happen quarterly. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses will be conducted, with a special focus on patterns and predictors of change studied through multilevel linear models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Research Bioethics Committee of the University of Barcelona (no. IRB00003099) and the ethical committee of ITA Mental Health, the organisation to which all participating centres belong. Dissemination will be in papers for peer-reviewed research journals and to clinicians working with ED.

Despite new guidelines being published recently, a number of important questions remained unanswered including the role of taxis, as initial non-operative management. This is particularly relevant now due to the possibility of a lack of immediate surgical care as a result of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to assess the role of taxis in the management of emergency inguinal hernias. METHODS: A review of the literature was undertaken. Available literature published until March 2019 was obtained and reviewed. 32,021 papers were identified, only 9 were of sufficient value to be used. RESULTS: There was a large discrepancy in the terminology of incarcerated/strangulated used. Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients. The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind. Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged.

Their adoption provides clinicians with a central location to access and share data, write notes, order labs and prescriptions, and bill for patient visits. However, as non-clinical requirements have increased, time spent using EHRs eclipsed time spent on direct patient care. Several solutions have been proposed to minimize the time spent using EHRs, though each have limitations. Digital scribe technology uses voice-to-text software to convert ambient listening to meaningful medical notes and may eliminate the physical task of documentation, allowing physicians to spend less time on EHR engagement and more time with patients. However, adoption of digital scribe technology poses many barriers for physicians. In this study, we perform a scoping review of the literature to identify barriers to digital scribe implementation and provide solutions to address these barriers. We performed a literature review of digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion and information extraction as a scope for future research. Fifteen articles met inclusion criteria. Of the articles included, four were comparative studies, three were reviews, three were original investigations, two were perspective pieces, one was a cost-effectiveness study, one was a keynote address, and one was an observational study. The published articles on digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion highlight digital scribe technology as a solution to the inefficient interaction with EHRs. Benefits of digital scribe technologies included enhancing clinician ability to navigate charts, write notes, use decision support tools, and improve the quality of time spent with patients. Digital scribe technologies can improve clinic efficiency and increase patient access to care while simultaneously reducing physician burnout. Implementation barriers include upfront costs, integration with existing technology, and time-intensive training. Technological barriers include adaptability to linguistic differences, compatibility across different clinical encounters, and integration of medical jargon into the note. Broader risks include automation bias and risks to data privacy. Overcoming significant barriers to implementation will facilitate more widespread adoption.

The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.","output":"Employees recruitment: A prescriptive analytics approach via machine learning and mathematical programming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Past public health crises (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, opioids, cholera, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lead, pollution, venereal disease, even coronavirus (COVID-19) have been met with interventions targeted both at the individual and all of society.

This article provides the rationale for such public health interventions, by compiling the evidence that added sugar, and by proxy the ultraprocessed food category, meets the four criteria set by the public health community as necessary and sufficient for regulation-abuse, toxicity, ubiquity, and externalities (How does your consumption affect me?). To their credit, some countries have recently heeded this science and have instituted sugar taxation policies to help ameliorate NCDs within their borders.

The main objective of this study was to assess the presence of CVH and ICC alterations in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate their association with short-term clinical outcome. Methods: 50 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients were studied with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and a non-invasive monitoring of ICC. Subjects were included on ICU admission;CVH was evaluated using mean flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries (mCBFV), pulsatility index (PI) and estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (eCPP), while ICC using the P2/P1 ratio of estimated ICP curve (B4C device). The primary composite outcome was unsuccessful weaning from respiratory support or death at day 7. Results: On the first assessment (n= 50), only P2/P1 (1.20 [1.00-1.28] vs. 1.00 [0.88-1.16];p=0.03) and eICP (14 [11-25] vs. 11 [7-15] mmHg;p=0.01) were significantly higher among patients with UO than others. Patients with UO had a significantly higher CVH/ICC score (9 [8-12] vs. 6 [5-7];p<0.001) than those with favorable outcome;the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for CVH/ICC score to predict UO was 0.86 (95% CIs 0.75-0.97);a score > 8.5 had 63 (46-77)% sensitivity and 87 (62-97)% specificity to predict UO. For those patients undergoing a second assessment (n=29) after a median of 11 (5-31) days, all measured variables were similar between the two time-points. No differences in the measured variables between ICU non-survivors (n=30) and survivors were observed.

First, a quantitative analysis where we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and proposed a simple CNN architecture with less parameters and computational power that can perform as good as Xception and DenseNet architectures if trained on small dataset of chest X-ray images.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between burnout and depression. METHODS The study took place in the general hospital AHEPA of Thessaloniki. All members of the nursing staff (in total 368 subjects) took part. The protocol was self-reported and anonymous, in order to obtain as valid data as possible and included the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to assess the level of burnout, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) to assess personality traits, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale to assess depressive symptomatology. RESULTS The analysis revealed a weak but significant relationship between burnout and depression. CONCLUSIONS Depression is a pervasive disorder that affects almost every aspect of the patient's life. On the contrary, burnout is, by definition, a syndrome restricted to the patient's professional environment. However, it seems that there may be two distinct types of burnout syndromes, of which the one comprising the majority of nurses has little or no common features with depression. The second type consists of individuals with a predisposition to develop burnout. The latter is characterized by more severe symptomatology, phenotypic similarity to depression and presumably common etiological mechanisms.","output":"Burnout in nursing staff: is there a relationship between depression and burnout?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics in humans.

Moreover, FGFR1 phosphorylation levels were downregulated in A549 cells by influenza A virus infection, while the repression of FGFR1 kinase using PD173074, a potent and selective FGFR1 inhibitor, could enhance virus replication. Furthermore, we found that FGFR1 inhibits influenza virus internalization, but not binding, during viral entry.

However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of the various commonly available double face masks used. In this study, we have compared the performance of single and double face configurations. Three types of 3-ply face mask (FM), three types of fabric face mask (CM) and nine configurations of these face masks were investigated based on morphology, filtration efficiencies, breathing resistance and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) content. The filtration efficiencies of the double face masks are enhanced when combined with a fabric mask, and were found to improve by 500% compared to those of a fabric mask. The lowest breathing resistance among the double masking was observed in the combination of FM1 and fabric face masks. From the results, it was found that all combinations of double face mask are suitable to use since the measurements indicate that the breathing resistance and CO(2) contents are still lower than the acceptable value set by the Malaysian Standard (MS 2323:2010) and European Standard (EN 149:2001 + A1:2009).

However, the relationship between being underweight and COVID-19 mortality remains inconclusive. Previous dose-response meta-analyses did not enroll or specifically analyze the underweight population. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in both obese and underweight patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until August 12, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, body mass index, obesity, overweight, and underweight. Three reviewers independently assessed the relevant articles, including the title, abstract, and full text, to identify eligible studies. We performed a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis, including only studies with at least three quantitative classifications for BMI. The nonlinear trend was evaluated using a restricted cubic splines model with three-knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by pooling only those studies which specifically evaluated underweight patients (BMI&amp;lt;18.5 kg/m2). Results: Thirteen studies comprising 25,828 patients were included in the analysis. In the linear model, the mortality of patients with COVID-19 increased by 1.5% for each 1-kg/m2 increase in BMI (pooled relative risk [RR] =1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.004?1.027). However, a significant non-linear relationship between BMI and mortality was observed (Wald test: Pnon-linearity&amp;lt;0.001). We demonstrated a J-shaped curve, indicating that both underweight and obese patients had a higher mortality than those with normal weight. Interestingly, overweight patients (BMI, 25?30 kg/m2) seemed to have the lowest mortality risk. Using a BMI of 15 kg/m2 as the reference, the RRs of mortality decreased with BMI, and this trend continued until BMI of approximately 28 kg/m2 (RR=0.743, 95% CI=0.576?0.959). The relationship between BMI and mortality was then reversed, and an upward trend was observed when BMI exceeded 30 kg/m2;the RRs (95% CI) at BMIs 30, 35, 40, and 45 kg/m2 were 0.745 (0.570?0.974), 0.841 (0.643?1.100), 1.082 (0.850?1.377), and 1.457 (1.129?1.879), respectively.

METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7  7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04).

When the laboratory parameters were considered, the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significant in predicting mortality in univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-1.21; p = 0.006, and OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.39; p = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, NLR was determined to be an independent marker to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. PSI and CURB-65 revealed a considerably precise prognostic accuracy for the patients with COVID-19 in our study as well. Moreover, thanks to that NLR results in a very short time, it can enable the clinician to predict mortality before the scoring systems are calculated and hasten the management of the patients in the chaotic environment of the emergency room.","output":"Clinical Features of the 60 Years and Older Patients Infected with 2019 Novel Coronavirus: Can We Predict Mortality Earlier?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many outbreaks occurring in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). We discuss this vulnerability among LTCF residents using an ecological framework, on levels spanning from the individual to families and caregivers, institutions, health services and systems, communities, and contextual government policies. Challenges abound for fully understanding the burden of COVID-19 in LTCF, including differences in nomenclature, data collection systems, cultural differences, varied social welfare models, and (often) under-resourcing of the LTC sector. Registration of cases and deaths may be limited by testing capacity and policy, record-keeping and reporting procedures. Hospitalization and death rates may be inaccurate depending on atypical presentations and whether or not residents' goals of care include escalation of care and transfer to hospital. Given the important contribution of frailty, use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is discussed as a readily implementable measure, as are lessons learned from the study of frailty in relation to influenza. Biomarkers hold emerging promise in helping to predict disease severity and address the puzzle of why some frail LTCF residents are resilient to COVID-19, either remaining test-negative despite exposure or having asymptomatic infection, while others experience the full range of illness severity including critical illness and death. Strong and coordinated surveillance and research focused on LTCFs and their frail residents is required. These efforts should include widespread assessment of frailty using feasible and readily implementable tools such as the CFS, and rigorous reporting of morbidity and mortality in LTCFs.","output":"COVID-19, frailty and long-term care: Implications for policy and practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To reduce the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, many pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories have been closed or have significantly reduced their testing capacity. Because these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6 to 18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFT, which includes spirometry, lung volume, and diffusion capacity measurement, is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, and novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers and mobile health technologies along with integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options comes important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed. However, the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic also presents a unique opportunity to augment conventional testing by including innovative and emerging approaches to measuring lung function remotely in patients with respiratory disease.

It is commonly used in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, tocilizumab has been widely used in severe COVID-19 infection with elevated markers of systemic inflammation. We report a case of active tuberculosis after the use of tocilizumab for COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Asian female with hypertension, coronary artery disease presented to the emergency department(ED) due to a one-day duration of fever, cough, and altered mental status. About three months prior to presentation, she had COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prolong hospitalization which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. She received tocilizumab, remdesivir, steroids and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 infection. Following the hospital stay, she was discharged to a long-term acute care facility, and then went home. She is originally from China and moved to the United States 50 years ago. In the ED she was febrile (100.4F) and hypoxemic, subsequently placed on 4L of nasal cannula. The laboratory data was remarkable for leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. The chest radiograph showed bilateral reticular nodular patchy opacities. The patient was admitted and empiric antibiotics were started for possible pneumonia. Despite this treatment, her respiratory status deteriorated and she was intubated on day 4, with CT chest (figure1) revealing innumerable bilateral micronodules with centrilobular distribution and tree-in-bud opacities. There were also 2 large cavitary lesions in the right upper lobe. The sputum specimen was sent, which returned positive for Acid-Fast Bacillus. In addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR on sputum was positive. Therefore, the first-line anti-tuberculosis agents including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex was isolated on sputum 3 weeks later. DISCUSSION: The data from clinical trials indicate that the use of tocilizumab is associated with a very low or absent risk of tuberculosis reactivation. However, this case highlights the judicious use of tocilizumab in patients who are at high risk of exposure or reactivation such as immigrants from endemic regions, IV drug users and health care workers, etc. In our case, the patient had other factors including severe COVID-18 infection, use of steroids, prolonged hospital stay, and malnutrition which might compromise the immune system, and predispose to active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that tests be performed to rule out latent tuberculosis in selected patients prior to tocilizumab use and monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during treatment.

NEWS and NEWS2 have good predictive abilities in patients with other infections and sepsis, however there is little evidence of their performance in COVID-19. METHODS: Using receiver-operating characteristics analyses, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the performance of NEWS or NEWS2 to discriminate the combined outcome of either death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 24 h of a vital sign set in five cohorts (COVID-19 POSITIVE, n = 405; COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, n = 1716; COVID-19 NOT TESTED, n = 2686; CONTROL 2018, n = 6273; CONTROL 2019, n = 6523). RESULTS: The AUROC values for NEWS or NEWS2 for the combined outcome were: COVID-19 POSITIVE, 0.882 (0.868?0.895); COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, 0.875 (0.861?0.89); COVID-19 NOT TESTED, 0.876 (0.85?0.902); CONTROL 2018, 0.894 (0.884?0.904); CONTROL 2019, 0.842 (0.829?0.855). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that NEWS or NEWS2 performance was good and similar in all five cohorts (range = 0.842?0.894) suggests that amendments to NEWS or NEWS2, such as the addition of new covariates or the need to change the weighting of existing parameters, are unnecessary when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Our results support the national and international recommendations for the use of NEWS or NEWS2 for the assessment of acute-illness severity in patients with COVID-19.","output":"The performance of the National Early Warning Score and National Early Warning Score 2 in hospitalised patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2) is a key modulator of signaling transduction and participates in the regulation of various cellular progresses under diverse physiological and pathological conditions.

Our results showed marked reductions in the abundance of AMOTL2 in TGF-1-stimulated ASM cells. Cellular functional investigations confirmed that the up-regulation of AMOTL2 dramatically decreased the proliferation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-1 in ASM cells. In contrast, the depletion of AMOTL2 exacerbated TGF-1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Further research revealed that the overexpression of AMOTL2 restrained the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in TGF-1-stimulated ASM cells. Moreover, the reactivation of YAP1 markedly reversed AMOTL2-mediated suppression of TGF-1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Together, these findings suggest that AMOTL2 restrains TGF-1-induced proliferation and ECM deposition of ASM cells by down-regulating YAP1 activation.","output":"AMOTL2 restrains transforming growth factor-1-induced proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition of airway smooth muscle cells via the down-regulation of YAP1 activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Query expansion is the process of reformulating the original query by adding relevant words. Choosing which terms to add in order to improve the performance of the query expansion methods or to enhance the quality of the retrieved results is an important aspect of any information retrieval system. Adding words that can positively impact the quality of the search query or are informative enough play an important role in returning or gathering relevant documents that cover a certain topic can result in improving the efficiency of the information retrieval system. Typically, query expansion techniques are used to add or substitute words to a given search query to collect relevant data. In this paper, we design and implement a pipeline of automated query expansion. We outline several tools using different methods to expand the query. Our methods depend on targeting emergent events in streaming data over time and finding the hidden topics from targeted documents using probabilistic topic models. We employ Dynamic Eigenvector Centrality to trigger the emergent events, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation to discover the topics. Also, we use an external data source as a secondary stream to supplement the primary stream with relevant words and expand the query using the words from both primary and secondary streams.

As compared to the standard WHO/CDC qPCR detection method, which consumes several hours for detection, CRISPR-based SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and FELUDA have emerged as rapid diagnostic tools for the detection of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 within an hour with 100% accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. These attributes of CRISPR-based detection technologies have taken themselves one step ahead of available detection systems and are emerging as an inevitable tool for quick detection of the virus. Further, the discovery of Cas13s nucleases and their orthologs has opened a new corridor for exploitation of Cas13s as an antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral diseases. One such approach is Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PACMAN), which needs a long haul to bring into therapy. The approval of SHERLOCK as the first CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit by the FDA, for emergency diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, has given positive hope to scientists that sooner human trials of CRISPR-based therapy will be ratified. In this review, we have extensively reviewed the present CRISPR-based approaches, challenges, and future prospects in the light of diagnostics and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. KEY POINTS: ?

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with xylazine 20 g/g by intraperitoneal injection and maintained with propofol or isoflurane. Myocardial IRI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 1 hour. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the expression of RACK1 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and the heart injury score were compared between the two groups. Results: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis with ROS was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the isoflurane group. The propofol group had significantly higher RACK1 expression and lower TLR4 expression, compared with the isoflurane group (RACK1, 1970.50  120.50 vs. 1350.20  250.30, p<0.05; TLR4, 980.50  110.75 vs. 1275.50  75.35, p<0.05).

However, this may leave patients more vulnerable to potential pathogen transmission routes via increased exposure to contaminated surfaces and contacts with individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the association between the number of intrahospital transfers undergone during a hospital spell and the development of a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). METHODS: A retrospective caseCcontrol study was conducted using data extracted from electronic health records and microbiology cultures of non-elective, medical admissions to a large urban hospital network which consists of three hospital sites between 2015 and 2018 (n=24 240). As elderly patients comprise a large proportion of hospital users and are a high-risk population for HAIs, the analysis focused on those aged 65 years or over. Logistic regression was conducted to obtain the OR for developing an HAI as a function of intrahospital transfers until onset of HAI for cases, or hospital discharge for controls, while controlling for age, gender, time at risk, Elixhauser comorbidities, hospital site of admission, specialty of the dominant healthcare professional providing care, intensive care admission, total number of procedures and discharge destination. RESULTS: Of the 24 240 spells, 2877 cases were included in the analysis. 72.2% of spells contained at least one intrahospital transfer. On multivariable analysis, each additional intrahospital transfer increased the odds of acquiring an HAI by 9% (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: Intrahospital transfers are associated with increased odds of developing an HAI. Strategies for minimising intrahospital transfers should be considered, and further research is needed to identify unnecessary transfers.

Several studies based on declarative data have suggested that the lockdown periods were associated with changes in psychoactive substance use but few relied on toxicological analyses. AIMS We studied the impact of lockdowns on the pattern of routine care toxicological screening performed on patients hospitalized at the emergency ward (EW) and intensive care units (ICU) at the Grenoble University Hospital. METHOD This was a retrospective, monocentric study comparing routine care toxicology biological tests performed in children older than 12 years of age and adults hospitalized at the ICU and EW in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Alcohol, illicit drugs, and medications were screened. Generalized linear models were generated to evaluate the effect of the lockdown periods on toxicology results, considering age and sex. RESULTS The study included 13,910 samples from 11,786 patients. There was no significant difference in the repartition of sex or age over the three years. The frequency of positive toxicological tests increased during the lockdown periods (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, (1.01-1.28), p = .026). The frequency of poly-exposures also rose during these periods (OR 1.43 (1.11-1.82), p = .004) mostly among men (OR 1.54 (1.02-2.04), p = .022), 12-25-year-old patients (OR 1.69 (1.07-2.31), p = .016), and seniors (>56 years) (OR 1.54 (1.00-1.97), p = .032).

We described the activity and the care organisation of the Hospitalisation At Home (HAH) structure during the pandemic for treating patients with anti\\\\cancer injections. METHODS: We report the established organisation, the eligibility criteria, the patient characteristics, the treatment schemes and the stakeholders role during two 5\\\\week periods in 2020, before and during the French population's lockdown. RESULTS: The increase of activity during the lockdown (+32% of treated patients, +156% of new patients and +28% of delivered preparations) concerned solid tumour, mainly breast cancer, even if haematological malignancies remained the most frequent. Thirty different drugs were delivered, including three new drugs administered in HAH versus 19 during the routine period (p < 0.01). For those clinical departments accustomed to using HAH, the usual organisation was kept, but with adjustments. Five clinical departments increased the number of patients treated at home and widened the panel of drugs prescribed. Three oncology departments and one radiotherapy department for the first time solicited HAH for anti\\\\cancer injections, mainly for immunotherapy. We adjusted the HAH organisation with additional human resources and allowed to prescribe drugs with an infusion time of <30 min only for the new prescribers. CONCLUSION: HAH allowed for the continuation of anti\\\\cancer injections without postponement during the pandemic, and for a decrease in unnecessary patient travel to hospital with its concomitant COVID\\\\19 transmission risk. Often left out of guidelines, the place of HAH in treating cancer patients should be reappraised, even more so during a pandemic.","output":"COVID\\\\19 outbreak: An experience to reappraise the role of hospital at home in the anti\\\\cancer drug injection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]calculating the appropriate RMD amount in 2021 and 2022 will be more challenging for taxpayers and tax practitioners [ ]the COVID-19 pandemic along with the increasing costs and shortages associated with long-term care have created a difficult financial environment for seniors [Sean Fleming, World Economic Forum, \\"How COVID-19 Has Exposed the Challenges Facing the Care Sector\\" (Aug 17, 2020);Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development, \\"Who Cares?

METHODS: We reviewed the MERS outbreak investigation report of the KCDC, and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from MERS. Using the media interview data, we reaffirmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure. RESULTS: The healthcare worker, a nurse, was infected while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a MERS patient in an isolation room. During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patients body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR. CONCLUSIONS: The possible routes of infection may include the following: respiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) through a gap between the face and mask; mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment.

In the post-COVID-19 Era, it is essential to understand the different needs and expectations of different communities for the use of park green space. A myriad of previous studies focused on the whole citys demand for park green space, while few studies examined spatial equity from a supply-demand perspective. This paper aims to investigate the differences in park green space accessibility among people of different ages at a community scale. Specifically, to better evaluate the accessibility of park green space and account for the travel choice, we compared the effects of the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method containing different distance decay functions (i.e., the improved 2SFCA methods) by considering the traffic network and the scale of park green space. In addition, we compared the improved 2SFCA methods with the traditional 2SFCA. This study investigated the spatial equity of park green space accessibility in 1184 communities with a total population of 6,468,612 in the central urban districts of Wuhan. The results showed that the high accessible communities were concentrated in the urban center along the Yangtze River. The improved 2SFCA methods outperformed the traditional 2SFCA, and presented smoother gradient information. It was revealed that over half of communities park green space accessibility levels did not match their population density. Inequality of accessibility to park green space was found in people of different ages, especially for the youth (Gini coefficient was as high as 0.83).

To assess the financial impact of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals, we have characterized the cost of COVID-19 admissions, using inpatient data from a Portuguese Tertiary Care University Centre. Methods: We analysed inpatient data from adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Admissions were eligible if the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was coded U07.1. We excluded admissions from patients under 18 years old, admissions with incomplete records, admissions from patients who had been transferred to or from other hospitals or those whose inpatient stay was under 24 h. Pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium admissions were also excluded, as well as admissions from patients who had undergone surgery. Results: We identified 223 admissions of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Most were men (64.1%) and aged 45-64 years (30.5%). Around 13.0% of patients were admitted to intensive care units and 9.9% died in hospital. The average length of hospital stay was 12.7 days (SD = 10.2) and the average estimated cost per admission was EUR 8,177 (SD = 11,534), which represents more than triple the inpatient base price (EUR 2,386). Human resources accounted for the highest proportion of the total costs per admission (50.8%). About 92.4% of the admissions were assigned to Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) 723, whose inpatient price is lower than COVID-19 inpatient costs for all degrees of severity. Conclusion: COVID-19 admissions represent a substantial financial burden for the Portuguese NHS. For each COVID-19 hospitalized patient it would have been possible to treat three other hospitalized patients. Also, the price set for DRG 723 is not adjusted to the cost of COVID-19 patients.

Disseminated sepsis being a systemic disorder with multisystem involvement, overshadows the timely recognition of bone and joint infections. Hence, we did this cross sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in disseminated sepsis in children, the organisms implicated, and their antibiotic sensitivities. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from 1st July 2016 to 31st September 2017 of children aged less than 12 years with disseminated sepsis, i.e., patients with fever and two or more sites of focal infection of anatomically non-contiguous tissues. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients of disseminated disease were included, of which 25 patients (46.3%) had osteoarticular infections. Septic arthritis was seen in 17 patients, and osteomyelitis was seen in 12 patients. The most common joint was hip (41.6%), and the most common bone involved was femur (53.8%). Blood culture showed MRSA in 28% and MSSA in 20%. Joint and bone aspirates showed S. aureus in 56% with 28% of MRSA and MSSA each. All Staphylococcus aureus organisms were found sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The mean values of CRP, duration of stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic was higher in MRSA infected patients compared to MSSA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent organism in musculoskeletal infection in disseminated sepsis children, with vancomycin sensitivity of 100% and methicillin sensitivity of 46.2% only.

OBJECTIVE To describe surgical techniques and provide clinical outcomes for robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) with selective clamping and robotic upper urinary tract reconstruction featuring novel applications of NIRF imaging. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from 90 patients who underwent successful RPN with selective clamping or upper urinary tract reconstruction utilizing NIRF imaging between April 2011 and October 2012 were reviewed. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RPN utilizing NIRF imaging to aid with selective clamping and upper tract reconstruction with NIRF imaging, the details of which are outlined in this paper and the accompanying video. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patient characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Of the 48 RPN patients for whom selective clamping was attempted successfully, median estimated blood loss was 200.0 ml, warm ischemia time was 17.0 min, and median change in estimated glomerular filtration rate was -6.3%. There was a 12.5% complication rate, and all complications were Clavien grade 1-3 (14.3%). The upper urinary tract reconstruction utilizing NIRF imaging was performed in 42 patients and included pyelopasty (n=20), ureteral reimplant (n=13), ureterolysis (n=7), and ureteroureterostomy (n=2). Radiographic and symptomatic improvement was observed in 100% of the pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplant, and ureteroureterostomy patients and 71.4% of ureterolysis patients, for an overall success rate of 95.2%.

In the present work, the sigmoidal-Boltzmann mathematical model was applied to study the Covid-19 spread in 15 different countries. The cumulative number of infected persons I has been accurately fitted by the sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (SBE), giving rise to different epidemiological parameters such as the pandemic peak t(p), the maximum number of infected persons I(max), and the time of the epidemic stabilization t(). The time constant relative to the sigmoid t (called also the slope factor) was revealed to be the determining parameter which influences all the epidemiological parameters. Empirical laws between the different parameters allowed us to propose a modified sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation describing the spread of the pandemic. The expression of the spread speed V(p) was further determined as a function of the sigmoid parameters. This made it possible to assess the maximum speed of spread of the virus V(pmax) and to trace the speed profile in each country. In addition, for countries undergoing a second pandemic wave, the cumulative number of infected people I has been successfully adjusted by a double sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (DSBE) allowing the comparison between the two waves.

Given that other serotypes of hypervirulent FAdVs have also been reported in poultry around the world, a common ELISA for all serotypes within the group I fowl adenoviruses (FAdV-I) is urgently needed, especially for clinical epidemic serotypes. In this study, we used high purity and concentration virions of FAdV-4 and developed a common ELISA for detecting antibodies against 12 FAdV-I serotypes. The developed ELISA was able to distinguish between antibodies against FAdV-I, FAdV-III, and other heterologous viruses without any cross-reaction. Furthermore, the ELISA showed higher sensitivity than the FAdV-1-based ELISA to the novel FAdV-4 found in China. Moreover, since there are no commercial vaccines against FAdVs in China, the ELISA was applied to detect sera samples from specific pathogen-free chickens inoculated with inactivated FAdV-1, FAdV-4, and FAdV-8a. The assay showed high sensitivities for all three detected serotypes within FAdV-I.

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs), used as a physiotherapy for bone defects, have been suspected to cause potential hazards to human health due to the long-term exposure. To optimize the application of EMF while avoiding its adverse effects, a combination of EMF and tissue engineering techniques is critical. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of EMF will lead to better applications in the future. METHODS: In this research, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on 3D-printed scaffolds were treated with sinusoidal EMFs in vitro. Then, 5.5 mm critical-sized calvarial defects were created in rats, and the cell scaffolds were implanted into the defects. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EMFs regulate BMSCs were explored with various approaches to gain deeper insight into the effects of EMFs. RESULTS: The cell scaffolds treated with EMF successfully accelerated the repair of critical-sized calvarial defects. Further studies revealed that EMF could not directly induce the differentiation of BMSCs but improved the sensitivity of BMSCs to BMP signals by upregulating the quantity of specific BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) receptors. Once these receptors receive BMP signals from the surrounding milieu, a cascade of reactions is initiated to promote osteogenic differentiation via the BMP/Smad signalling pathway. Moreover, the cytokines secreted by BMSCs treated with EMF can better facilitate angiogenesis and osteoimmunomodulation which play fundamental roles in bone regeneration. CONCLUSION: In summary, EMF can promote the osteogenic potential of BMSCs and enhance the paracrine function of BMSCs to facilitate bone regeneration. These findings highlight the profound impact of EMF on tissue engineering and provide a new strategy for the clinical treatment of bone defects.","output":"Sinusoidal electromagnetic fields accelerate bone regeneration by boosting the multifunctionality of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES While vascular alterations in solid tumor malignancies are known to decrease therapeutic delivery, the effects of leukemia-induced bone marrow vasculature (BMV) alterations on therapeutic delivery are not well known. Additionally, functional quantitative measurements of the leukemic BMV during chemotherapy and radiotherapy are limited largely due to a lack of high-resolution imaging techniques available preclinically. This study develops a murine model using compartmental modeling for quantitative multiphoton microscopy (QMPM) to characterize the malignant BMV before and during treatment. METHODS Using QMPM, live time-lapsed images of dextran leakage from the local BMV to the surrounding bone marrow of mice bearing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were taken, and fit to a two-compartment model to measure the transfer rate (Ktrans), fractional extracellular extravascular space (ec), and vascular permeability parameters as well as functional single-vessel characteristics. In response to leukemia-induced BMV alterations, the effects of 2-4Gy low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) on the BMV, drug delivery, and mouse survival were assessed post-treatment to determine if neo-adjuvant LDRT prior to chemotherapy improves treatment outcome. RESULTS Mice bearing ALL had significantly altered Ktrans, increased ec, and increased permeability compared to healthy mice. Angiogenesis, decreased single-vessel perfusion and decreased vessel diameter were observed. BMV alterations resulted in disease-dependent reductions in cellular uptake of Hoechst dye. LDRT to mice bearing ALL dilated BMV, increased single-vessel perfusion, and increased daunorubicin uptake by ALL cells. Consequently, LDRT administered to mice before receiving Nilotinib significantly increased survival compared to mice receiving LDRT after Nilotinib, demonstrating the importance of LDRT conditioning before therapeutic administration. CONCLUSION Developed QMPM enables single-platform assessments of the pharmacokinetics of fluorescent agents and characterization of the BMV. Initial results suggest BMV alterations after neo-adjuvant LDRT may contribute to enhanced drug delivery and increased treatment efficacy for ALL. Developed QMPM enables observations of the BMV for use in ALL treatment optimization.","output":"Biophysical characterization of the leukemic bone marrow vasculature reveals benefits of neo-adjuvant low-dose radiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last nine months have been not short of challenging, overwhelming, heart-acheing individual and collective experiences which have and probably will continue to shape our ways of living for generations to come.

Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between age, sex, COVID-19, and population density in Thailand. This study proposed to examine the relationships among age, sex, population density, and the number of COVID-19 patients in Thailand. Material and Methods: In this nationwide descriptive correlational study, the dataset of daily COVID-19 cases in Thailand between January 12, 2020, and November 30, 2020, and population density (people/km2) in each province of Thailand was retrieved from the Open Government Data of Thailand, the Registration Office Department of the Interior, the Ministry of the Interior, and the National Statistical Office of Thailand. Chi-square and Pearson product-moment correlation were used to determine the difference and relationships among studied variables. Simple linear regression was used to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on population density. Results: The findings illustrated a significant difference between male and female patients, in which the number of male patients was higher than female patients across age groups 31-45 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years (p-value<0.010). Further, population density was significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 cases.

Methods: Using Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model system, we spiked swabs in vitro for proof-of-concept testing. Swabs were spiked in serial dilutions from 1.2x10 6 to 1.2x10 1 copies/mL and then placed in 2mL tubes with viral transport media (VTM) to mimic the specimen collection procedures in the clinic prior to processing via shaker-mill homogenization. After homogenization, 1 L of lysate was processed using RT-qPCR for amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene, qualifying viral detection.

We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods. Findings: Descriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes <200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. Respondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%). Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed steady for 3374 (74.4%); 640 (14.1%) reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) than before (1469/15887, 9.3%).

Racial disparities continue to need to be addressed in order to improve early and late outcomes of older adults with CAP. SUMMARY The epidemiology of CAP, specifically for older adults is changing. More recent pathogen incidence studies have included culture, as well as newer microbiological methods to determine etiology. Current disparities among disadvantaged populations, including African-Americans, result in more comorbidities which predisposes to more severe CAP.

I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface.

The objective of this study were to assess relationships among Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol, fatty acid binding protein 4, and metabolic parameters in obese patients with severe type 2 diabetes mellitus; and to evaluate the relative contribution of abdominal subcutaneous adipose and visceral adipose to the secretion of fatty acid binding protein 4. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol (n = 29) or to intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol augmented with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 34). Relationships among fatty acid binding protein 4 and demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters, and 12-month changes in these values were examined. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue explants from obese nondiabetic patients (n = 5) were obtained and treated with forskolin to evaluate relative secretion of fatty acid binding protein 4 in the different adipose tissue depots. RESULTS The intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass cohorts had similar fasting serum fatty acid binding protein 4 concentrations at baseline. At 1 year, mean serum fatty acid binding protein 4 decreased by 42% in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participants (P = .002) but did not change significantly in the intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol cohort.

This brief review addresses the understandings of some of the common immunopathogenetic mechanisms in the context of autoimmune rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and COVID\\\\19. Apart from demographic comparisons, the role of type I interferons (IFN), presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and finally mechanism of action of HCQ in both the scenarios are discussed here. High risks for fatal disease in COVID\\\\19 include older age, metabolic syndrome, male gender, and individuals who develop delayed type I IFN response. HCQ acts by different mechanisms including prevention of cellular entry of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and inhibition of type I IFN signaling. Recent controversies regarding efficacy of HCQ in management of COVID\\\\19 warrant more studies in that direction. Autoantibodies were also reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as in COVID\\\\19. Rheumatologists need to wait and see whether SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection triggers development of autoimmunity in patients with COVID\\\\19 infection in the long run.","output":"Understanding immunopathological fallout of human coronavirus infections including COVID\\\\19: Will they cross the path of rheumatologists?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a host immune disorder induced by infection. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which has high morbidity and mortality. There has been great progress in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, such as improvements in pathogen detection technology, innovations regarding anti-infection drugs, and the development of organ function support. Abnormal immune responses triggered by pathogens, ranging from excessive inflammation to immunosuppression, are recognized to be an important cause of the high mortality rate. However, no drugs have been approved specifically for treating sepsis. Here, we review the recent research progress on immune responses in sepsis to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of sepsis.

We report the effects of experience and innovation on outcomes in minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS Esophageal resections for cancer from 2007 to 2016 at Levine Cancer Institute at Carolinas Medical Center (Charlotte, NC) were reviewed. During this time, three changes in technique were made to improve outcomes: vascular evaluation of the gastric conduit to improve anastomotic healing (beginning at case #63), one-stage approach to permit access to abdomen and chest through one draped surgical field (case #82), and adoption of a lung-protective anesthetic protocol (case #101). Mortality, operative time, complications, and length of stay were analyzed relative to these interventions using GLM regression. RESULTS 200 patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy. There were no mortalities at 30 days, and no change in mortality rate at 60 and 90 days. Anastomotic leak decreased significantly after the introduction of intraoperative vascular evaluation of the gastric conduit (3.6 vs 19.4%). Operative time decreased with adoption of a one-stage approach (416 vs 536 min). Pulmonary complications decreased coincident with a change in anesthetic technique (pneumonia 6 vs 28%). Lymph node harvest increased over time. Length of stay was driven primarily by complications and decreased with operative experience. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative complications, operative time, and length of stay decreased with case experience and alterations in surgical and anesthetic technique. We believe that adoption of the techniques and technology described herein can reduce complications, reduce hospital stay, and improve patient outcomes.","output":"Quality Improvement in Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy: Outcome Improvement Through Data Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We address the hypothesis that the extraordinary sandstorm occurred on 22-24 February 2020 might have a role in the different cumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases between the islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, since it obliged to reduce significantly air traffic and forced to suspend all major carnival street events in all most locations.

However, few data are available for school children on their knowledge of infectious diseases and their prevention. The aim of the study was to develop and apply a standardized questionnaire for children when visiting primary schools to survey their knowledge about infectious diseases, pathogen transmission and prevention measures. Enrolling thirteen German primary schools, 493 questionnaires for grade three primary school children were included for further analyses, comprising 257 (52.1%) girls and 236 (47.9%) boys with an age range of 8C11 years. Out of 489 children, 91.2% participants indicated that they knew about human-to-human transmissible diseases. Of these, 445 children responded in detail, most frequently mentioning respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, followed by childhood diseases. Addressing putative hygiene awareness-influencing factors, it was worrisome that more than 40.0% of the children avoided visiting the sanitary facilities at school. Most of the children (82.9%) noted that they did not like to use the sanitary facilities at school because of their uncleanliness and the poor hygienic behavior of their classmates. In conclusion, basic infection awareness exists already in primary school age children. Ideas about the origin and prevention of infections are retrievable, however, this knowledge is not always accurate and adequately contextualized.

Based on existing research the study supports that there are short-term effects on office emissions, i.e., carbon emissions do not outshine the long-term effects. The shift from offices to working from home due to COVID-19 regulations meant more people operating from home as maintaining their position in the market was crucial. The potential research area is to understand how this would affect energy usage and carbon emissions. This study has used a before and after mixed approach to collect data from 301 working-from-home employees and 348 top managers who are responsible for monitoring the employees in a work from home setting. Convenience sampling helped collect responses in a timely manner as offices were not allowing visitors and collecting data in person was difficult, so online surveys were conducted. Work from home reduced usage of office equipment, transportation, pollution, etc. The air quality improved considerably but our findings show that the low emissions were only short-lived. This was not a long-term scenario as organizations kept practicing their operations even at home and the emissions stayed in the environment. Future suggestions and implications are also provided.

Over 15 million people have already been affected worldwide by COVID-19, resulting in more than 0.6 million deaths. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in the cellular process of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the human body. Recently a study has reported some SARS-CoV-2 proteins that interact with several human proteins while many potential interactions remain to be identified. METHOD: In this article, various machine learning models are built to predict the PPIs between the virus and human proteins that are further validated using biological experiments. The classification models are prepared based on different sequence-based features of human proteins like amino acid composition, pseudo amino acid composition, and conjoint triad. RESULT: We have built an ensemble voting classifier using SVM(Radial), SVM(Polynomial), and Random Forest technique that gives a greater accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, and F1 score compared to all other models used in the work. A total of 1326 potential human target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been predicted by the proposed ensemble model and validated using gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.

Their function can be affected by a number of drugs or other substances, many of which alter ciliary beat frequency (CBF). This has implications for diseases of the respiratory tract and nasal drug delivery. This article is a systematic review of the literature that examines 229 substances and their effect on CBF. METHODS MEDLINE was the primary database used for data collection. Eligibility criteria based on experimental design were established, and 152 studies were ultimately selected. Each individual trial for the substances tested was noted whenever possible, including concentration, time course, specific effect on CBF, and source of tissue. RESULTS There was a high degree of heterogeneity between the various experiments examined in this article. Substances and their general effects (increase, no effect, decrease) were grouped into six categories: antimicrobials and antivirals, pharmacologics, human biological products, organisms and toxins, drug excipients, and natural compounds/other manipulations. CONCLUSION Organisms, toxins, and drug excipients tend to show a cilioinhibitory effect, whereas substances in all other categories had mixed effects.

Evacuation by aircraft may be an effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure. METHODS: We constructed a SETAIR (susceptible-exposed-transitional-asymptomatic-infectious-recovered) model to capture the epidemic growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the predicted number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents if evacuation had not occurred at the end of January. We used data on the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hubei Province for the period Jan 20-Feb 16, 2020, and on the number of cases of Japanese residents who were evacuated by aircraft on Jan 29, 30, and 31. RESULTS: Eleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents was estimated to reach 25 (95% CI [20,29]) on Feb 8 and 34 (95% CI [28,40]) on Feb 15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to 14 additional cases and a 2-week delay to 23 additional cases.

Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100).

Although a reduction in platelet reactivity and improved clinical outcomes occur when using adjunctive cilostazol with dual antiplatelet therapy, this can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Therefore, our current study examined patients undergoing CAS and evaluated the impact of cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet treatment on the outcomes. METHODS Between 2010 and 2015, 137 consecutive patients underwent CAS. From 2010 to 2011 (period 1), 28 patients underwent CAS in conjunction with aspirin and clopidogrel dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT). From 2010 to 2013 (period 2), 44 patients underwent a preoperative assessment of their platelet function, with the clopidogrel-resistant patients receiving adjunctive cilostazol in addition to the aspirin and clopidogrel. From 2013 to 2015 (period 3), 65 patients underwent CAS in conjunction with cilostazol and clopidogrel treatment. In all patients, the incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions observed by diffusion-weighted imaging on the day after CAS, and ischemic or hemorrhagic events occurring within 30 days were assessed. RESULTS Clopidogrel resistance was identified in 43% of the patients in period 1, in 16% in period 2, and in 5% in period 3 (P < 0.001). The on-treatment platelet reactivity results indicated that the PRU value during cilostazol-based DAPT was significantly lower than that observed for the standard DAPT (P < 0.05). New ipsilateral ischemic lesions decreased by 9% and 8% in periods 2 and 3, respectively, versus a 25% decrease in period 1 (P = 0.047). However, there were no significant differences noted for any of the hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS Compared to the standard aspirin and clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy, cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet treatment reduces the rate of clopidogrel resistance and suppresses new ischemic lesions without hemorrhagic complications.","output":"Efficacy of cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet treatment in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The unrestricted use of linezolid has been linked to the emergence of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (LRSE). We report the effects of combined antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures on the spread of LRSE in an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Microbiological data were reviewed to identify all LRSE detected in clinical samples at an ICU in southwest Germany. Quantitative data on the use of antibiotics with Gram-positive coverage were obtained in defined daily doses (er 100 patient-days (PD). In addition to infection control measures, an antibiotic stewardship intervention was started in May 2019, focusing on linezolid restriction and promoting vancomycin, wherever needed. We compared data from the pre-intervention period (May 2018CApril 2019) to the post-intervention period (May 2019CApril 2020). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to determine the genetic relatedness of LRSE isolates. RESULTS: In the pre-intervention period, LRSE were isolated from 31 patients (17 in blood cultures). The average consumption of linezolid and daptomycin decreased from 7.5 /10D and 12.3 /100 Per month in the pre-intervention period to 2.5 /100 PD a5.7 /100 PD per th in the post-intervention period (p = 0.0022 and 0.0205), respectively.

We measured the temperature change of inspired gases in the ETT under various oscillatory frequencies and oscillatory volumes with a fixed base flow. The temperatures in the ETT during HFV were compared with the temperatures during conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). RESULTS As the oscillatory frequency was increased and the oscillatory volume (VThf) decreased, the difference in temperature between the Y piece and the inlet of an artificial lung in the ETT (ETT outside of body) increased. However, as the oscillatory frequency increased, there was no difference in the ETT temperature under constant oscillatory volume. In contrast, as the oscillatory volume was decreased, the difference in temperature in the ETT was greater under constant oscillatory frequency. Moreover, the temperature drop in the ETT with HFV was lower than that in the IPPV temperature with a similar respiratory volume.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 workflow changes to permit social distancing and patient and staff safety included screening at the time of scheduling, encouraging patients to use our digital platform to complete registration/safety forms prior to appointments, stationing screeners at all entrances, limiting waiting room capacity, implementing a texting system to notify patients of delays, limiting dressing room use by encouraging patients to wear exam-appropriate clothing, and accelerating MRI protocols without reducing image quality. We assessed patients pre-exam wait times, MR exam times, overall time spent on site, and registration for and use of the digital portal before (February 2020) and after (June 2020) implementation of these measures. RESULTS: Across 17 outpatient imaging centers, workflow changes resulted in a 23.1% reduction (-6.8 minutes) in all patients pre-exam wait times (p <0.00001). Pre-exam wait times for MRI, CT, ultrasound, x-ray, and mammography decreased 28.4% (-10.3 minutes), 16.5% (-6.7 minutes), 25.3% (-7.7 minutes), 22.8% (-3.7 minutes), and 23.9% (-5.0 minutes), respectively (p < 0.00001 for all).

Despite NTDs being regarded as equity tracers, little attention has been paid toward gender dynamics and relationships for gender-equitable access to NTD programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper examines the impact of NTDs on womens health and wellbeing in SSA using Kenya as a case study. This research is part of a larger research program designed to examine the impact of NTDs on the health and wellbeing of populations in Kenya. Thematic analysis of key informants interviews (n = 21) and focus groups (n = 5) reveals first that NTDs disproportionately affect women and girls due to their assigned gender roles and responsibilities. Second, women face financial and time constraints when accessing health care due to diminished economic power and autonomy. Third, women suffer more from the related social consequences of NTDs (that is, stigma, discrimination and/or abandonment), which affects their health-seeking behavior. As such, we strongly suggest a gender lens when addressing NTD specific exposure, socio-economic inequities, and other gender dynamics that may hinder the successful delivery of NTD programs at the local and national levels.","output":"The Impact of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) on Womens Health and Wellbeing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): A Case Study of Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the case of clustered data, an artificial neural network with logcosh loss function learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the two.

This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches. The method not only classifies the data based on these branches but also provides an accurate prediction for the majority cluster. The method successfully classifies the data based on an invisible feature.

Herein, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of MoS2 nanotube on the binding of the signal protein YAP65, an important Yes kinase-associated protein domain (WW domain), to the proline rich motif ligand (PRM). We designed four systems based on the different initial binding modes among WW domain, PRM and MoS2 nanotube, and observed two ways to affect the binding of WW domain to PRM. The first pathway, the active site in WW domain was occupied by MoS2 nanotube, which prevents WW domain from binding to PRM. In the second pathway, WW domain was bound to PRM with residues W17 and F29 instead of the two highly conserved residues (Y28 and W39), forming an unstable combination. These two results might cause WW domain to lose its original function or to pass the mistaken signal. However, MoS2 nanotube did not destroy the structure and binding of WW domain and PRM in the composite.

Participants were divided into two groups based on their booster vaccination status with measles-mumps-rubella: the non-vaccinated group (n=207) and the vaccinated group (n=38). The rate of COVID-19 seropositivity, age, body mass index (BMI), active smoking and presence of comorbidity were also measured and recorded.

Mesial and distal radiographic marginal bone levels (mBLs) from baseline (i.e. delivery of FDPC) to the follow-up examination were calculated and compared between implant surfaces adjacent to and distant from the cantilever extension. Implant survival rate, pocket probing depth (PPD), presence/absence of bleeding on probing (BoP) and presence/absence of mechanical/technical and biological complications were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with 30 FDPCs supported by 60 implants were re-evaluated after a mean loading time of 13.3  2.7 years (range: 10-18.6 years). One diameter-reduced implant carrying a cantilever extension fractured, yielding a patient-based survival rate of 96.2% (95% CI: 0.95/1.0).

Five patients eligible for local excision of rectal tumors, four males and one female, mean age 58 years (range 50-78), underwent surgery using the SSL? device. The average distance from anal verge was 4 cm (range 1-6). Four patients had an initial diagnosis of adenoma, and one had a previous endoscopic excision of a T1 adenocarcinoma with positive margins. In one patient, due to the lack of exposure, the procedure was converted to a low anterior resection. In the remaining four patients, average setup time was 7 minutes (range 4-15) and average operative time was 52 minutes (range 38-72). All resection margins were tumor free. There were no postoperative complications. Two of the presumed adenomas were intramucosal adenocarcinomas, while one patient had a T2 tumor and underwent radical surgery. Although at the present time the appropriate use of local excision is still under debate, TAMIS is a technique with great potential.

The 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each against influenza A was found to be in the high nanomolar range, and the selectivity index (SI = 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)]/EC(50)) was determined to be >324 for AG879 and 50 for A9, indicating that therapeutically useful concentrations of each drug produce only low levels of cytotoxicity.

Late titer increases did not occur in specimens from caesarian section without labor(0/12) and were significantly (p=0.023) more frequent in specimens where labor occurred (7/17).

Nevertheless, the association between inflammation fluctuation and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID\\\\19 is not clear. Methods: : We performed a secondary analysis of the ORCHID trial. Inflammation fluctuation was assessed by WBC variability indices ( SD [standard deviation], and CV [coefficient of variation]). Cox regression was used to compute the hazard ratio for WBC variability and associated hospitalization and death over 28 days. Results: : During the 28 days post-randomization, 46 (10.8%) patients died, and 345 (81.4%) patients were discharged. In multivariable analysis, a worse clinical outcome, including decreased risk of hospital discharge ( SD HR 2.32;P <0.001;CV 1.72;P =0.001) and increased mortality ( SD HR 1.51;P =0.002;CV 1.35;P =0.006), was found with increased WBC variability. Furthermore, WBC variability had moderate performances in predicting discharge (C-index, SD 0.705;CV 0.703), and all-cause death over 28 days (C-index, SD 0.632, CV 0.688). Sensitivity analyses that involved changing 28-day mortality to in-hospital mortality, recalculating the WBC indices by using the lowest WBC value, and using the competing risk model generated confirmatory results. Most of the interactions between sex, age (>65), hydroxychloroquine treatment group, and WBC variability indices were not significant ( P >0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, our results showed that COVID-19 patients with higher WBC variability had lower discharge rates and higher mortality.

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern. We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease.

Although the opportunity to verify the rumour is often just one click away, many users fail to make a correct evaluation. We studied this phenomenon by implementing a web-based questionnaire that was compiled by 7,298 different volunteers. Participants were asked to mark 20 news as true or false. Interestingly, false news is correctly identified more frequently than true news, but showing the full article instead of just the title, surprisingly, does not increase general accuracy. Also, displaying the original source of the news may contribute to mislead the user in some cases, while the wisdom of the crowd can positively assist individuals' ability to classify correctly. Furthermore, participants that autonomously opened an additional browser tab while compiling the survey show higher accuracy than users that did not.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard-of-care treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, which includes patients with stage IB3 to IVA disease, and it is effective for many patients; however, cervical cancer-related mortality remains high. The critical nature of cervical cancer treatment is underscored by the recent launch of the World Health Organization global initiative to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer using a triple-intervention strategy of increased vaccination, screening, and treatment. The initiative calls for 90% of all patients diagnosed with cervical cancer to receive the appropriate treatment, but to reach this global goal there are significant barriers related to radiotherapy that must be addressed. We discuss and review evidence of the lack of adherence to guideline-recommended treatment, brachytherapy underutilization, limited access to radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries, as well as regional limitations within high-income countries, as the major barriers to radiotherapy treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. We further review ways these barriers are currently being addressed and, in some cases, make additional recommendations to address these issues. Finally, despite receiving recommended treatments, many patients with locally advanced cervical cancer have a poor prognosis. With effective administration of current standards of care, the global community will be able to shift focus to advancing treatment efficacy for these patients.

MethodsDe-identified maternal and newborn outcomes will be collected monthly from all public maternity services in Melbourne, allowing rapid analysis of a multitude of perinatal indicators. Weekly outcomes will be displayed as run charts according to established methods for detecting non-random signals in health care. A pre-pandemic median for all indicators will be calculated for the period of January 2018 to March 2020. A significant shift is defined as [] six consecutive weeks, all above or below the pre-pandemic median.

The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of information in the nascent months of the 2019-2020 Covid-19 outbreak.The fifty most popular articles on Facebook for the period between November 2019 and March 25, 2020 (as collated by Buzzsumo- a social media analyzing tool) were analyzed by independent researchers and sorted into classifications for accurate, inaccurate and misleading. Following evaluation, 32% of articles were deemed to be accurate, 18% inaccurate, and 50% misleading (as defined by containing both accurate and inaccurate information). To restate, 68% of the 50 most popular articles on Facebook were not accurate during the study period. Impressions, shares and comments on Facebook in a summation of inaccurate and misleading articles were also analyzed in separate fashion and found to be 71.44%, 74.97%, and 80.22% respectively. These numbers outpace the 68% of total articles for which these types of stories account.In addition, shares were individually assessed as they indicate a desire to propagate the information forward on the part of the user, and were found to have occurred 6.61 million times in the inaccurate and misleading group compared to 2.2 million for accurate articles, for a cumulative rate of 74.9% of shares, again outpacing the 68% expected.There is a high rate of both inaccurate and misleading information related to the Covid-19 outbreak on Facebook, as assessed by physician reviewers. This information is not only more prevalent than the accurate information, but also received more engagement via overall impressions, as well as shares and comments.

This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)Cbased fully automated CT image analysis system for detection, diagnosis, and burden quantification of pulmonary TB. METHODS: From December 2007 to September 2020, 892 chest CT scans from pathogen-confirmed TB patients were retrospectively included. A deep learningCbased cascading framework was connected to create a processing pipeline. For training and validation of the model, 1921 lesions were manually labeled, classified according to six categories of critical imaging features, and visually scored regarding lesion involvement as the ground truth. A TB score was calculated based on a network-activation map to quantitively assess the disease burden. Independent testing datasets from two additional hospitals (dataset 2, n = 99; dataset 3, n = 86) and the NIH TB Portals (n = 171) were used to externally validate the performance of the AI model. RESULTS: CT scans of 526 participants (mean age, 48.5  16.5 years; 206 women) were analyzed. The lung lesion detection subsystem yielded a mean average precision of the validation cohort of 0.68. The overall classification accuracy of six pulmonary critical imaging findings indicative of TB of the independent datasets was 81.08C91.05%. A moderate to strong correlation was demonstrated between the AI modelCquantified TB score and the radiologist-estimated CT score. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed end-to-end AI system based on chest CT can achieve human-level diagnostic performance for early detection and optimal clinical management of patients with pulmonary TB.

As the prognosis of organ failure improves with early treatment, it is important to identify these patients as early as possible. Most studies on organ failure have been performed in intensive care settings, or on selected groups of patients, where a high prevalence and mortality have been reported. Before patients arrive to the intensive care unit, or the general ward, most of them have passed through the emergency department (ED), where diagnosis and treatment has been initiated. The prevalence and prognosis of acutely ill patients, with organ failure, at arrival have been studied in some selected groups, but methods and results differ. This systematic review aims to identify, summarize, and analyze studies of prevalence and prognosis of new onset organ failure in acutely ill undifferentiated patients, at arrival to hospital. The result of the review will assist physicians working in an ED, when assessing patients' risk of organ failure and their associated prognosis. METHODS The information sources used are electronic databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL; references in included studies and review articles; and authors' personal files. One author will perform the title and abstract screening and exclude obviously ineligible studies. By an independent full-text screening, two authors will decide on the eligibility for the remaining studies. Eligible studies will include an unselected group of acutely ill adult patients at arrival to hospital, with one or more organ failures (respiratory, renal, cerebral, circulatory, hepatic, or coagulation failure). Included studies will have assessed the prevalence or prognosis, defined as mortality or ICU transfer, of new onset organ failure. From included studies, bibliographical and study description data, patient characteristics, and data related to prevalence of organ failure and prognosis will be extracted. We will assess risk of bias in included studies using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool for prognostic studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. We expect heterogeneity and to conduct a qualitative synthesis of the results. If, however, heterogeneity is low, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis stratified by basic study design.

METHODS: We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS>10) at admission (n = 8, 50% vs n = 8, 28%).

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays in previous publications used either single or multiplex assays for SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA detection and a singleplex approach for subgenomic RNA detection. Although multiplex approaches often target multiple genomic RNA segments, an assay that concurrently detects genomic and subgenomic targets has been lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed two duplex one-step RT-qPCR assays that detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic ORF1a and either subgenomic spike or subgenomic ORF3a RNAs. All primers and probes for our assays were designed to bind to variants of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, our assays successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 Washington strain and delta variant isolates at various time points during the course of live virus infection in vitro. The ability to quantify subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA is important, as it may indicate the presence of active replication, particularly in samples collected longitudinally. Furthermore, specific detection of genomic and subgenomic RNAs simultaneously in a single reaction increases assay efficiency, potentially leading to expedited lucidity about viral replication and pathogenesis of any variant of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Duplex One-Step RT-qPCR Assays for Simultaneous Detection of Genomic and Subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has struck Lebanon in its worst period of instability, not only impacting physical health, but also increasing psychological distress.

A survey was designed and administered to students who were enrolled in at least one mathematics module in an Irish university at the time of the closures. The survey comprised three sections: teaching and learning, assessment and personal experience, with a focus on how the changes in teaching and assessment were viewed by students. A total of 263 students from six universities responded to the survey. The corresponding data are described, as are various trends that were identified through open-response questions. The data offer a window into the student experience during the tertiary level closures and show the effect that the sudden shifts (e.g., in delivery and support) had on learning, assessment and student well-being. The survey responses show that most students dealt with the rapid changes in a resilient and mature manner, particularly when confronted with adversity.

As a result, we determined the pathogenicity of different passages' isolates (SHXX1902 strain) and compared the immunogenicity of G2c-subtype strain (SHXX1902 strain) with the commercial AJ1102 vaccine. The viral titer reached 107 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml, which met the requirement for seed virus replication during vaccine development. Five-day-old piglets were orally infected with viruses from passages P5 and P35 to determine the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of different passages. Pregnant sows were immunized with inactivated SHXX1902-P5 or the commercial AJ1102 vaccine (first immunized with an attenuated vaccine and then boosted with an inactivated vaccine) to study the influence of the culture method on the immunogenicity of the strain. The median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) and the median lethal dose (LD50) of the P5 virus were 102.00 and 102.84 TCID50/ml, respectively. All five piglets infected with the SHXX1902-P5 virus shed the virus 24 h after vaccination, whereas only two of the five piglets treated with the SHXX1902-P35 virus shed the virus 48 h after vaccination. The SHXX1902-P35 virus was partially attenuated in the 5-day-old piglets. Inactivated SHXX1902-P5 induced PEDV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses equivalent to those induced by AJ1102 after infection in sow serum. However, the IgA titer induced by AJ1102 was much higher than that induced by inactivated SHXX1902-P5 since the boost immunization. On days 5 and 7 after farrowing, the IgA titers were similar among the immunized groups. Our study highlights that serial passage can lead to the attenuation of G2c-subtype strain. The immunogenicity of the inactivated strain was similar to the commercial vaccine.

AIMS: This study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hospital-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection at work and related factors at the University Hospital of Trieste workers exposed to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: From March 1 to May 31, of 4216 employees, 963 were in contact with COVID-19 patients or colleagues and were followed up. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs was determined every 3 days, by RT-PCR. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 193 workers were positive for COVID-19 (5%), and 165 of these (86%) were symptomatic. We identified five major cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in Trieste Hospitals, four of which occurred before the implementation of universal masking for HCWs and patients (1C14 March 2020). COVID-19 infection was significantly higher in high-risk ward workers (Infectious Diseases, and Geriatric and Emergency Medicine, odds ratio [OR] 13.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.8C31), in subjects with symptoms (OR 5.4; 95% CI 2.9C10) and in those with contacts with COVID-19 patients and colleagues (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.01C4.9). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital workers were commonly infected due to contact with COVID-19 patients and colleagues, mainly in the first 15 days of the pandemic, before the implementation of universal mask wearing of HCWs and patients.

This study monitored the viral RNA abundance at one WWTP and three communities during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Yanta district of Xi'an city from December 2021 to January 2022. To further understand the decay of the coronavirus in sewage pipes, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was seeded in two recirculating water systems and operated for 90 days. Based on the viral abundance in the wastewater of Xi'an and the above data regarding the decay of coronavirus in sewage pipes, Monte Carol simulations were performed to estimate the infectious cases in Xi'an. The results suggested that the delta variant was first detected on Dec-10, five days earlier than the reported date of clinical samples. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on Dec 18 in the monitored community two days earlier than the first case and was consecutively detected in the following two sampling times. In pipelines without biofilms, the results showed that high temperature significantly reduced the viral RNA abundance by 3.1 log10 GC/ml after experiencing 20 km travel distance, while only a 1.6 log10 GC/L reduction was observed in the pipeline with a low water temperature. After 90 days of operation, the biofilm matured in the pipeline in both systems. Reductions of 2.14 and 4.79 log10 GC/L were observed in high- and low-temperature systems, respectively. Based on the above results, we adjusted the input parameters for Monte Carol simulation and estimated 23.3, 50.1, 127.3 and 524.2 infected persons in December 14, 18, 22 and 26, respectively, which is largely consistent with the clinical reports.

Previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. Thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the PRRSV genome in the current study. RESULTS: Four antiviral mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) were evaluated for their antiviral effects against VR2332, a prototype of type 2 PRRSV. Among the mutagens, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil had significant antiviral effects against VR2332. Consequently, VR2332 was serially passaged in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations to facilitate the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants. Two ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, emerged from serial passages in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. The genetic stability of these resistant mutants was evaluated in MARC-145 cells and compared with VR2332. As expected, the ribavirin-resistant mutants exhibited higher genetic stability compared to their parental virus. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. However, ribavirin-resistant mutants emerged when treated with low concentrations (0.2 mM) of ribavirin, and those mutants were genetically more stable during serial passages in cell culture.","output":"Effects of ribavirin on the replication and genetic stability of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is common among children and adolescents. The aims of this study were to identify clinical differences between patients with vasovagal syncope and those with epileptic seizures, which account for a large proportion of TLOC cases, and to evaluate the effectiveness of various diagnostic tests. METHODS The medical records of 160 children and adolescents with TLOC were analyzed retrospectively, and age, sex, clinical symptoms, and trigger factors were recorded. The cardiological and neurological evaluations performed included electrocardiograms, computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalograms (EEGs), echocardiograms, and head-up tilt tests (HUTTs). Overall assessments of the 160 patients generated final diagnoses. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 14.6 years old and TLOC occurred more frequently among girls (59.4%). The most common final diagnosis was vasovagal syncope (n = 102, 63.4%), followed by undetermined (n = 21, 13.1%) and epileptic seizures (n = 17, 10.6%). There were many other diagnoses, including cardiogenic syncope (1.3%). Patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope were much more likely to have dizziness or light-headedness and blurred vision as pre-symptoms (p < 0.05), whereas patients diagnosed with epileptic seizures were more likely to have convulsions as an accompanying sign (p < 0.05). In addition, standing up was the most significant trigger factor for TLOC among those diagnosed with vasovagal syncope (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the HUTT for vasovagal syncope were 95.1%, 75.0%, and 91.8%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of EEGs for epileptic seizures were 80.0%, 70.6%, and 80.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Vasovagal syncope and epileptic seizures should be considered as possible causes of most cases of TLOC in children and adolescents.

Minorities and immigrants are the populations most likely to experience disparities related to health-care access and health outcomes. We aimed to link self-reports of health conditions with experiences of discrimination when using health-care services among Romani ethnic minorities in the European Union (EU). METHODS: The Second EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey was disseminated in 2016 to ethnic minorities, immigrants, and descendants of immigrants in 19 member states of the EU (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, and the UK). The primary outcomes were self-reported health status (subjective assessment of own health conditions), health-care utilisation, and unmet health-care need. Experiences of discrimination when using health-care services in the past 5 years was the key explanatory variable. Anonymised data relating to perceived discrimination, self-reported good health, health-care utilisation, and socioeconomic status were available for individuals who identify as Romani ethnic minorities in nine EU member states-Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the association between perceived discrimination and self-reported health status, health-care utilisation, and unmet health-care needs, controlled for sex, age, income level, education level, health insurance coverage, and residential location. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of self-perceived discrimination are reported. FINDINGS: Using data on perceived discrimination when using health care, self-reported health status, health-care access, and socioeconomic status for 7942 Romani individuals (aged 16-90 years), including 4046 Romani individuals who have used health-care services during the past 5 years, we found that perceived discrimination when utilising health care is more prevalent for Romani people than other ethnic minorities in Europe (OR 219, 95% CI 196-244). After controlling for sex, age, income level, education level, health insurance coverage, and residential location, our multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the perceived discrimination of Romani people is negatively associated with self-reported good health (adjusted OR 084, 069-103), and health-care utilisation (adjusted OR 034, 025-044). Furthermore, Romani people's perceived discrimination is associated with an increased risk of unmet health-care needs (adjusted OR 301, 227-398). The results were robust across sexes. INTERPRETATION: A multifaceted strategy might be needed to eliminate the disparities in health outcomes and health-care access between the Romani ethnic group and other ethnic minority groups in the EU, including expanding access to health care, addressing social determinants of health, and advancing anti-discrimination regulations in the EU.

The analysis comprised 6 478 999 individuals age 15 years with aggregated area-level data on sex and age distribution and no COVID-19 history. We estimated vaccination hazard and cumulative incidence using the Fine and Gray competing risk model. RESULTS: Older age and higher socioeconomic status (SES) were associated, with stepwise higher cumulative vaccination rates (age 20C24: 67%, age  75: 96%; SES 1C3: 61%, 4C5: 74.2%, 6C7: 82%, 8C10: 87%). We found the lowest vaccination rates in Arab (65%) and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish (54%) areas. SES modified the association in Arab neighbourhoods, with higher coverage than in the non-Orthodox Jewish reference group in SES 1C3 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02C1.11], and gradually lower coverage in higher SES classes (SES 6C7: HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.79C0.87).

METHODS: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. RESULTS: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation  5.3; range 12-45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2-81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2-53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5-60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48-2.14). Low negative attitudes score were associated with a higher decrease in anxiety (odds ratio = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33-1.89).

Methods We created a natural language processing pipeline to extract concepts from clinical notes in a local ER corresponding to the PCR testing date for patients who had a COVID-19 test and evaluated these concepts as predictors for developing COVID-19. We identified predictors from Firth's logistic regression adjusted by age, gender, and race. We also performed ConceptWAS using cumulative data every two weeks to identify the timeline for recognition of early COVID-19-specific symptoms. Results We processed 87,753 notes from 19,692 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing between March 8, 2020, and May 27, 2020 (1,483 COVID-19-positive).

PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions, including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 h postinfection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection Induces Caspase-8-Mediated G3BP1 Cleavage and Subverts Stress Granules To Promote Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020.

METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period covered the 27th of February to the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays, and we analyzed the epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12,656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate for men (58.18%) than for women (41.82%).

We find that Republican-leaning counties comply less than Democratic-leaning ones, which we argue underlines the importance of trust in science and acceptance of large-scale government policies for compliance. However, this partisan compliance gap shrinks when directives are given by Republican leaders, suggesting citizens are more trusting of co-partisan leaders. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of social trust increase compliance;yet these gains attenuate or intensify depending upon community-level partisan sentiments.

Multiple studies have reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation exert an enormous function on the occurrence and development of IDD. Autophagy can effectively repair ER stress and maintain ECM homeostasis. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can specifically induce autophagy. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that EPA can promote autophagy, reduce ECM degradation and ER stress in vitro, thereby reducing cell apoptosis, and the protective effects of EPA in an IDD-rat model in vivo. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the autophagic flux, ER stress, ECM degradation, and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) treated by EPA. We also used puncture-induced IDD rats as experimental subjects to observe the therapeutic effect of EPA on IDD. Our findings indicated that EPA can effectively improve the autophagy activity in NPCs, inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum stress process, reduce the degree of cell apoptosis, and exert protective effects on the anabolism and catabolism of ECM. In addition, in vivo investigations demonstrated that EPA ameliorated the progression of puncture-induced IDD in rats. In conclusion, this study revealed the intrinsic mechanisms of EPAs protective role in NPCs and its potential therapeutic significance for the treatment of IDD.","output":"Eicosapentaenoic Acid-Induced Autophagy Attenuates Intervertebral Disc Degeneration by Suppressing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Extracellular Matrix Degradation, and Apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been understudied among vulnerable populations, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. We aimed to analyse how the pandemic is related to early changes in mental health and parenting stress among caregivers, many of whom are internally displaced persons (IDP), in a conflict-affected setting in Colombia. METHODS: For this cohort study, we used longitudinal data from a psychosocial support programme in which 1376 caregivers were randomly assigned across four sequential cohorts. Recruitment of participants took place in March, 2018, for cohort 1; July, 2018, for cohort 2; March, 2019, for cohort 3; and July, 2019, for cohort 4. Participants completed assessments at baseline, 1-month, and 8-month follow-ups. The 8-month assessment occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic for participants in cohorts 1 and 2 (n=573), whereas those in cohorts 3 and 4 (n=803) were assessed during the early stages of the pandemic, 2C5 weeks after the national lockdown began on March 25, 2020. Primary caregiver anxiety and depression were measured with a scale adapted from the Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised and parenting stress was measured with the short form of the Parenting Stress Index. We estimated how mental health changed by comparing prepandemic and postpandemic 8-month outcomes using lagged-dependent variable models. FINDINGS: Results showed that the likelihood of reporting symptoms above the risk threshold increased by 14 percentage points for anxiety (95% CI 10C17), 5 percentage points for depression (05C9), and 10 percentage points for parental stress (5C15). The deterioration in mental health was stronger for IDP, participants with lower education or pre-existing mental health conditions, and for those reporting a higher number of stressors, including food insecurity and job loss. INTERPRETATION: Maternal mental health significantly worsened during the early stages of the pandemic. Considering the vulnerability and pre-existing mental health conditions of this population, the estimated effects are substantial. Policies in fragile and conflict-affected settings targeting IDP and other vulnerable people will be important to mitigate further mental health and socioeconomic problems.

However, this is a rarely discussed topic in political science. This article discusses the results of our pedagogical research on the emotional impact of learning about atrocities, the challenges of studying during a global pandemic, and the benefits of self-care activities (e.g., meditation) for student well-being.

It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12. At the end, all of the patients died from sudden cardiac arrest, which was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 2 cases. From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS.

STUDY DESIGN: Four AAP placentae in the third trimester of pregnancy (two positive for HIV-1 and two positives for SARS-CoV-2) were histologically examined. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2(+) HIV(+) placentae were dysmorphic in shape compared to the flattened disc-like shape noted in the SARS-CoV-2(+)HIV(-), SARS-CoV-2(-)HIV(+)and SARS-CoV-2(-)HIV(-) placentae. Diffused syncytial knots and syncytial degeneration were observed in all placentae. Intermittent cytotrophoblast increase, perivillous and intravillous fibrin deposition, mononuclear inflammatory cells with widespread degeneration/necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast and microcalcification were pronounced in the SARS-CoV-2(+)HIV(+) compared to the SARS-CoV-2(+)HIV(-) placentae. Vascular pathological changes included thrombi, ectasis, mural hypertrophy and atherotic vessels. CONCLUSION: Elevated syncytial trophoblast injury, villitis, microcalcifications and mineralisation of the syncytial basement membrane in the AAP placentae may be due to SARS-CoV-2 viral transgression instead of HIV infection alone. Vascular malperfusion is suggestive of a hypoxic insult arising from a compensatory response to meet the fetal oxygen and nutrient demands of an AAP.

The Opium War largely influenced the history of China in 19th century; however, China was once recognized as a drug-free nation for 3 decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. Drug abuse has spread quickly since re-emerging as a national problem in China in the late 1980s. The number of registered drug abusers increased from 70 000 in 1990 to more than 1 million by the end of 2005. In past decades, illicit drug trafficking and production have swept most provinces in China, and drug abuse has caused many problems for both abusers and the community. One major drug-related problem is the spread of HIV, which has caused major social and economic damage in China. Germany, the largest developed European country, also faces the drug and addiction problem. Germany has about 150 000 heroin addicts, for whom HIV/AIDS has become a serious threat since the mid 1980s. To control the drug problem, the German Government adopted the Action Plan on Drugs and Addiction in 2003; the China Central Government approved a similar regulation in the antidrug campaign in 2005. Germany has experience in reducing drug-related harm. The methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program has run for more than 20 years and the public has become more tolerant of addicts. In 2003, China began the MMT program for controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is necessary for China to learn from developed countries to acquire success in its antidrug campaign. In this review, we will go over the differences and similarities in drug abuse between Germany and China. The differences are related to history, population and economics, drug policy context, drug laws, HIV/hepatitis C virus infection, the MMT program and so on. These 2 nations have drug abuse problems with different histories and currently use different approaches to handle illicit drug marketing and use. The legal penalties for illicit drug offences reflect the social differences of these 2 nations with respect to the seriousness of particular types of crimes. The characteristics of the MMT program may also influence patterns of drug abuse in these 2 nations and China should improve the MMT program based on the successful model in Europe, the USA, and Australia.

PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on protection against reinfection after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), the World Health Organization global literature database, ClinicalTrials.gov, COVID19reviews.org, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Longitudinal studies that compared the risk for reinfection after SARS-CoV-2 infection versus infection risk in individuals with no prior infection. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and rated quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Across 18 eligible studies, reinfection risk ranged from 0% to 2.2%. In persons with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with unvaccinated, previously uninfected individuals, 80% to 98% of symptomatic infections with wild-type or Alpha variants were prevented (high strength of evidence). In the meta-analysis, previous infection reduced risk for reinfection by 87% (95% CI, 84% to 90%), equaling 4.3 fewer infections per 100 persons in both the general population (risk difference, ?0.043 [CI, ?0.071 to ?0.015]) and health care workers (risk difference, ?0.043 [CI, ?0.069 to ?0.016]), and 26.6 fewer infections per 100 persons in care facilities (risk difference, ?0.266 [CI, ?0.449 to ?0.083]). Protection remained above 80% for at least 7 months, but no study followed patients after the emergence of the Delta or Omicron variant. Results for the elderly were conflicting. LIMITATION: Methods to ascertain and diagnose infections varied. CONCLUSION: Before the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants, persons with recent infection had strong protection against symptomatic reinfections for 7 months compared with unvaccinated, previously uninfected individuals. Protection in immunocompromised persons, racial and ethnic subgroups, and asymptomatic index case patients is unclear. The durability of protection in the setting of the Delta and Omicron variants is unknown. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

We compared the data from 220 Japanese and 7 foreign players during the new life with COVID-19 with the data from before COVID-19, which was obtained from 233 Japanese and 18 foreign players. We measured anxiety and depression symptoms with the validated Kessler-6, which has been widely used in clinical and research settings among different populations. To investigate the distribution of K6 score and whether there are discrete clusters or not, we conducted the two-step cluster analysis. Results: In the new life with COVID-19, 15.0% of players reported mild symptoms, which was significantly lower than the 32.3% of players before COVID-19. The prevalence of moderate and severe symptoms was 6.7 and 3.5%, respectively, in the group during the new life with the COVID-19, and 4.8 and 5.2% in the pre-COVID-19 group, with no significant difference.

However, it is still unclear whether the metrics of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of Likert scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant, monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying this study is that a link exists between correlations across the percentage of assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is introduced for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according to the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using objective acoustic parameters, which shows significant improvement when applied to the corrected data.

ResultsCompared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio 0.03; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.06, p<0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All other drug groups did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly related with response to vaccination. Vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. InterpretationSome disease modifying therapies carry a risk of attenuated response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine response in people with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury caused by viral myocarditis may occur during COVID-19 infections. This condition may lead to cardiomyopathy as the chronic sequela. We report a case of an adolescent COVID-19 survivor without underlying heart disease presented with dilated cardiomyopathy. CASE SUMMARY: A 16-year-old male patient was referred to Cardiology Outpatient Clinic, Indonesian Army Central Hospital Gatot Soebroto. The patient presented with a chief complaint of fatigue and just recovered from mild to moderate COVID-19 one month before the visit. There was no prior history of heart disease. Physical examination was within normal limit, but laboratory findings showed highly elevated NT-proBNP (7705 pg/mL) and D-dimer (1850 ng/mL). ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with poor R wave progression. Echocardiography detected all chamber dilatation, eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinetic, moderate mitral regurgitation, and reduced ejection fraction (22%). The patient was diagnosed with new-onset dilated cardiomyopathy as a COVID-19 sequela and we initiated treatment with ARB (candesartan), beta-blocker (bisoprolol), diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone), rivaroxaban, and trimetazidine. During a follow-up visit three months later, the patients recovery was stable. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of new-onset cardiomyopathy in our previously healthy young patient highlights the possible mechanism of COVID-19 as a single cause of myocardial injury without underlying heart disease. Comprehensive evaluation and optimal treatment should be taken during hospitalization and post-discharge period to prevent further complications. Additional examinations such as cardiac magnetic resonance and endomyocardial biopsy should be done to provide definitive confirmation.","output":"C74.

Compelling evidence shows that pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), a brown-like adipose adjacent to the external surface of the pericardium, is associated with CAD. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of PAT in CAD are elusive. This study aims to characterize human PAT and explore its association with CAD. METHODS: We acquired samples of PAT from 31 elective cardiac surgery patients (17 CAD patients and 14 controls). The transcriptome characteristics were assessed in 5 CAD patients and 4 controls via RNA-sequencing. Cluster profile R package, String database, Cytoscape were applied to analyze the potential pathways and PPI-network key to DEGS, whereas the hubgenes were predicted via Metascape, Cytohubba, and MCODE. We use Cibersort, ENCORI, and DGIDB to predict immunoinfiltration, mRNA-miRNA target gene network, and search potential drugs targeting key DEGs. The predictable hubgenes and infiltrating inflammatory cells were validated in 22 patients (12 CAD samples and 10 control samples) through RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A total of 147 different genes (104 up-regulated genes and 43 down-regulated genes) were identified in CAD patients. These different genes were associated with immunity and inflammatory dysfunction. Cibersort analysis showed monocytes and macrophages were the most common subsets in immune cells, whereas immunohistochemical results revealed there were more macrophages and higher proportion of M1 subtype cells in PAT of CAD patients. The PPI network and module analysis uncovered several crucial genes, defined as candidate genes, including Jun, ATF3, CXCR4, FOSB, CCl4, which were validated through RT-qPCR. The miRNA-mRNA network implicated hsa-miR-185-5p as diagnostic targets and drug-gene network showed colchicine, fenofibrate as potential therapeutic drugs, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PAT is mainly associated with the occurrence of CAD following the dysfunction of immune and inflammatory processes. The identified hubgenes, predicted drugs and miRNAs are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CAD.","output":"Association of Pericardiac Adipose Tissue With Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Listeriosis is a major foodborne infection provoked by a bacterium known as Listeria monocytogenes. It is one of the predominant causes of death in pregnant women, infants, and immunocompromised persons. Despite such fatal effects, until now there is no proper medication or drug available for such a serious foodborne infection. One of the most promising ways to deal with this challenge is vaccination. This present study aims at the prediction of B cell epitopes for subunit vaccine designing against Listeria monocytogenes using a reverse vaccinology approach. Among screened out 299 epitopes of strain F2365 of Listeria monocytogenes, based on the VaxiJen score, the top 20 epitopes were selected. 3D modeling of epitopes and alleles was generated by PEPstrMOD and Swiss Model respectively. Molecular docking reveals 4 epitopes viz., MKFLFPLKL, CEETFGIRL, FLKIDPPIL, and VRHHGGGHK based on binding energy. All 4 epitopes were investigated for non-toxicity, binding affinity, and population coverage. After vigorous investigation, epitope FLKIDPPIL was anticipated as the best vaccine contender. The stability of the FLKIDPPIL-HLA DRB1 _0101 complex was proved by performing the simulation. Here, predicted peptide through the Insilico approach may become a potential remedy against listeriosis, after the wet-lab approach and clinical trials.","output":"Proteomic Exploration of Listeria monocytogenes for the Purpose of Vaccine Designing Using a Reverse Vaccinology Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Young people transitioning from out-of-home care, commonly called care leavers, are known to be a vulnerable group Many experience poor outcomes leading them to become homeless or involved in the criminal justice system Yet compared to most other Anglophone democracies, Australia lacks mandatory assistance for care leavers beyond 18 years of age There are also major legislative, policy, and program differences between care leaver entitlements in the individual states and territories This paper argues that the Commonwealth Government should introduce a nationally consistent extended care system that would require all jurisdictions to provide a minimum standard of support until at least 21 years of age A uniform set of extended care standards is even more vital in the context of COVID-19 IMPLICATIONS Many Australian care leavers have poor life chances despite recent advances in the support programs provided by the states and territories A nationally consistent extended care program is likely to progress improved opportunities and outcomes for care leavers (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Ending australia's status as a \\"leaving care laggard\\": The case for a national extended care framework to lift the outcomes for young people transitioning from out-of-home care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of e-learning has become mandatory during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This Q-methodology explorative study was conducted in Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A sample of 37 medical students was purposively selected to represent different characteristics. The students distributed 37 statements representing different aspects of e-learning in medical education into a nine-point scoring grid from \\"least agree\\" to \\"most agree.\\" RESULTS: Data analysis revealed three distinct viewpoints. The first viewpoint, complete dependence on e-learning, emphasized a preference for e-learning to continue medical education and complete the study year with a minimal return to study halls or practical/clinical sessions. The second viewpoint, opponents of applying e-learning in medical education, included a generally negative view about e-learning and its role in medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The third viewpoint, e-learning as a supplement to medical education, emphasized a generally positive view about e-learning and considered it a supplement to the theoretical parts of medical education during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The three diverse viewpoints are primarily distinguished by the availability of e-learning experience and skills, availability of technology, risk perception of COVID-19, and the need for in-hospital clinical teaching.

NAFLD has become one of the most common indications for liver transplantation. The deleterious effects of NAFLD are not isolated to the liver only, for it has been recognized as a systemic disease affecting multiple organs through protracted low-grade inflammation mediated by the metabolic activity of excessive fat tissue. Extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD such as cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism have been well described in the literature. In recent years, it has become evident that patients suffering from NAFLD might be at higher risk of developing various infections. The proposed mechanism for this association includes links through hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, alterations in innate immunity, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, a risk independent of these factors mediated by alterations in gut microbiota might contribute to a higher burden of infections in these individuals. In this narrative review, we synthetize current knowledge on several infections including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, coronavirus disease 2019, and Clostridioides difficile as they relate to NAFLD.

The methodological foundation of the research is composed of the provisions of a comprehensive approach that has been used as a basis for determining the cause-and-effect relationship between the member states of the integration association and their mutual trade risks in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The analysis of statistical data is based on the methodology of econometric theory;in particular, the methods of horizontal and trend analysis. This paper analyzes the measures that were taken by the EEU member states to fight the pandemic of a new coronavirus infection both at the national level and at the level of the EEU institutions. The authors showed the asynchronous nature of measures introduced at the national level, while in certain circumstances the economic inefficiency of the introduction of measures, taken at the supranational level, and the impact of imposed restrictions on the current situation with mutual trade in goods and services, and free movement of workers. It has been substantiated that the examination of the economic interaction of the EEU member states in the period of restrictions dictated by a new coronavirus infection has revealed several endemic problems and had a major impact on the achievement of the main objectives of the integration association, transforming the terms for the management of corporate social responsibility.

GCIS is based on the induced suffix sorting algorithm SAIS, presented by Nong et al. in 2009. The proposed solution builds on the factorization performed by SAIS during suffix sorting. A context-free grammar is used to replace factors by non-terminals. The algorithm is then recursively applied on the shorter sequence of non-terminals. The resulting grammar is encoded by exploiting some redundancies, such as common prefixes between right-hands of rules, sorted according to SAIS. GCIS excels for its low space and time required for compression while obtaining competitive compression ratios. Our experiments on regular and repetitive, moderate and very large texts, show that GCIS stands as a very convenient choice compared to well-known compressors such as Gzip, 7-Zip, and RePair, the gold standard in grammar compression. In exchange, GCIS is slow at decompressing. Yet, grammar compressors are more convenient than Lempel-Ziv compressors in that one can access text substrings directly in compressed form, without ever decompressing the text. We demonstrate that GCIS is an excellent candidate for this scenario because it shows to be competitive among its RePair based alternatives. We also show, how GCIS relation with SAIS makes it a good intermediate structure to build the suffix array and the LCP array during decompression of the text.","output":"Grammar Compression By Induced Suffix Sorting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Immunization is a critical tool in the fight against infectious disease epidemics. Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may be used to implement appropriate policy changes and implementation of the public health campaigns to promote immunization with a wide range of vaccines against common diseases, such as measles, human papillomaviruses, or pertussis, and novel diseases, such as COVID.","output":"Links between conspiracy beliefs, vaccine knowledge, and trust: Anti-vaccine behavior of Serbian adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposes serious problems to health systems around the world and its rapid expansion makes it difficult to serve patients with certain health conditions such as cancer patients which might be at high risk for mortality if they are infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AIM: To compare the outcomes of cancer patients admitted due to COVID-19 and compare them with data of COVID-19 infected patients without a history of cancer. METHODS: In this case-controlled study, 93 healthy people and 92 patients with malignancy admitted for COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical features and laboratory indicators were assessed at the presentation and both groups were followed-up for treatment options and outcomes prospectively and compared at the level of P &#8804; .05. RESULTS: COVID-19 related mortality rate in malignant patients was significantly higher than patients without malignancy (41.3% vs 17.2%, P = .0001).

Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors - job loss, trouble paying rent, and social isolation - and suicidal ideation in 2020 using bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance. Suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2).

As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5  5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6  3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.","output":"Tracing and analysis of 288 early SARS-CoV-2 infections outside China: A modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with significant cognitive impairment and increased risk for mental health comorbidities.

METHODS: Data collected from all consecutive patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) who presented to a dedicated Post-COVID Clinic were used to evaluate whether certain psychiatric symptoms were more strongly associated with cognitive impairment and self-reported memory disturbances. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed that depression symptom severity was significantly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment among patients with PASC. This association was driven primarily by lower performance on verbal fluency, attention, and delayed recall tasks among patients with higher depression symptoms severity. Perceived sleep concerns were an important predictor of self-reported memory disturbances. Conversely, neither PTSD symptom severity nor anxiety symptom severity were significant predictors of cognitive impairment or self-reported memory disturbances.

RESULTS: We identified four similar trajectories in the two countries: (1) low stable; (2) mid-peak; (3) increasing; and (4) decreasing. Relatively more Americans were in the low-stable trajectory group than Canadians (77.6% vs. 64.9%), and fewer Americans were in the decreasing group (7.1% vs. 19.1%).

(3) Annotation of the same scene at different phases: juxtaposing video recordings of the same scene at different moments of its development reveals nuanced sets of information about directorial choices, acting, movement, duration, and more. ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","output":"Comparative video annotation and visual literacy: performance analysis of Rina Yerushalmis theatre language"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We investigated the effects of two different types of manual rib cage compression on expiratory flow and mucus clearance during prolonged mechanical ventilation in pigs. DESIGN Prospective randomized animal study. SETTING Animal research facility, University of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS Nine healthy pigs. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Pigs were tracheally intubated, sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. The animals were prone on a surgical bed in the anti-Trendelenburg position. The experiments were carried out at approximately 60 and 80 hrs from the beginning of mechanical ventilation. Two types of manual rib cage compressions were tested: Hard and brief rib cage compressions synchronized with early expiratory phase (hard manual rib cage compression) and soft and gradual rib cage compressions applied during the late expiratory phase (soft manual rib cage compression). The interventions were randomly applied for 15min with a 15-min interval between treatments. Respiratory flow and mucus movement were assessed during the interventions. Respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics were assessed prior to and after the interventions. Peak expiratory flow increased to 60.17.1L/min in comparison to 51.24.6L/min without treatment (p < 0.0015) and 48.74.3L/min with soft manual rib cage compression (p = 0.0002). Similarly, mean expiratory flow increased to 28.45.2L/min during hard manual rib cage compression vs. 15.92.2 and 16.62.8L/min without treatment and soft manual rib cage compression, respectively (p = 0.0006). During hard manual rib cage compression, mucus moved toward the glottis (1.01  2.37mm/min); conversely, mucus moved toward the lungs during no treatment and soft manual rib cage compression, -0.28  0.61 and -0.150.95mm/min, respectively (p = 0.0283). Soft manual rib cage compression slightly worsened static lung elastance and cardiac output (p = 0.0391). CONCLUSIONS Hard manual rib cage compression improved mucus clearance in animals positioned in the anti-Trendelenburg position. The technique appeared to be safe. Conversely, soft manual rib cage compression was not effective and potentially unsafe. These findings corroborate the predominant role of peak expiratory flow on mucus clearance.","output":"Effects of manual rib cage compressions on expiratory flow and mucus clearance during mechanical ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual tours are gaining increasing importance especially in the last year, when emerged the need to make develop new products and strategies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which people where obliged to stay at home or, however, with strong limitations.

However, there is no evaluation about the impact in changes of practices on the prognosis over time. METHODS: Single center, retrospective study, conducted from March 5(th) to April 25(th) 2020, in adults hospitalized in a medicine ward for a COVID-19. Patient characteristics were compared between 2 periods (before/after March 19(th)) considering French guidelines issued by learned societies. Aim of the study was to evaluate how medical care impacted unfavorable outcome, namely admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were admitted, mean age was 59.0  16.3 years, mean CRP level was 84.071.1 mg/L, 46% had a lymphocyte count<1000/mm(3). When prescribed, anti-infective agents were lopinavir-ritonavir (n=12), azithromycin (AZI) (n=28) and AZI combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=52). Between the 2 periods we noted a significant decrease of ICU admission, from 43% to 12% (p<0.0001). Delays until transfer in ICU were similar between periods (p=0.86). Pulmonary CT-scan were significantly more performed (from 50% to 90%, p<0.0001), as oxygen-dependency (53% vs 80%, p=0.001) and prescription of AZIHCQ (from 25% to 76%, p<0.0001) were greater over time.

Gene content variation among picocyanobacterial populations in separate ocean basins often mirrors the selective pressures imposed by the region's distinct biogeochemistry. By pairing genomic datasets with trace metal concentrations from across the global ocean, we show that the genomic capacity for siderophore-mediated iron uptake is widespread in Synechococcus and low-light adapted Prochlorococcus populations from deep chlorophyll maximum layers of iron-depleted regions of the oligotrophic Pacific and S. Atlantic oceans: Prochlorococcus siderophore consumers were absent in the N. Atlantic ocean (higher new iron flux) but constituted up to half of all Prochlorococcus genomes from metagenomes in the N. Pacific (lower new iron flux). Picocyanobacterial siderophore consumers, like many other bacteria with this trait, also lack siderophore biosynthesis genes indicating that they scavenge exogenous siderophores from seawater. Statistical modeling suggests that the capacity for siderophore uptake is endemic to remote ocean regions where atmospheric iron fluxes are the smallest, especially at deep chlorophyll maximum and primary nitrite maximum layers. We argue that abundant siderophore consumers at these two common oceanographic features could be a symptom of wider community iron stress, consistent with prior hypotheses.

However, dead spaces would not be sensible to oxygen supplementation, and also, enlargement of pulmonary vessels it has been evidenced.

It has significantly influenced public health, the world economy, and the persons lives. Hence, there is a need to speed up the diagnosis and precautions to deal with COVID-19 patients. With this explosion of this pandemic, there is a need for automated diagnosis tools to help specialists based on medical images. This paper presents a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classification and segmentation approach for COVID-19 detection from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed approach is employed to classify and segment the COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal CT images. The classification stage is firstly applied to detect and classify the input medical CT images. Then, the segmentation stage is performed to distinguish between pneumonia and COVID-19 CT images. The classification stage is implemented based on a simple and efficient CNN deep learning model. This model comprises four Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), four batch normalization layers, and four convolutional (Conv) layers. The Conv layer depends on filters with sizes of 64, 32, 16, and 8. A 2  2 window and a stride of 2 are employed in the utilized four max-pooling layers. A soft-max activation function and a Fully-Connected (FC) layer are utilized in the classification stage to perform the detection process. For the segmentation process, the Simplified Pulse Coupled Neural Network (SPCNN) is utilized in the proposed hybrid approach. The proposed segmentation approach is based on salient object detection to localize the COVID-19 or pneumonia region, accurately. To summarize the contributions of the paper, we can say that the classification process with a CNN model can be the first stage a highly-effective automated diagnosis system. Once the images are accepted by the system, it is possible to perform further processing through a segmentation process to isolate the regions of interest in the images. The region of interest can be assesses both automatically and through experts. This strategy helps so much in saving the time and efforts of specialists with the explosion of COVID-19 pandemic in the world. The proposed classification approach is applied for different scenarios of 80%, 70%, or 60% of the data for training and 20%, 30, or 40% of the data for testing, respectively. In these scenarios, the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 100%, 99.45%, and 98.55%, respectively. Thus, the obtained results demonstrate and prove the efficacy of the proposed approach for assisting the specialists in automated medical diagnosis services. ? 2022 Tech Science Press.

The goals of this systematic review were (1) to review the types of laryngeal injuries and their patient-reported symptoms and clinical signs resulting from endotracheal intubation in patients intubated for surgeries and (2) to better understand the overall the frequency at which these injuries occur. We conducted a search of 4 online bibliographic databases (ie, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and The Cochrane Library) and ProQuest and Open Access Thesis Dissertations (OPTD) from database inception to September 2019 without restrictions for language. Studies that completed postextubation laryngeal examinations with visualization in adult patients who were endotracheally intubated for surgeries were included. We excluded (1) retrospective studies, (2) case studies, (3) preexisting laryngeal injury/disease, (4) patients with histories of or surgical interventions that risk injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, (5) conference abstracts, and (6) patient populations with nonfocal, neurological impairments that may impact voice and swallowing function, thus making it difficult to identify isolated postextubation laryngeal injury. Independent, double-data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration's criteria. Twenty-one articles (1 cross-sectional, 3 cohort, 5 case series, 12 randomized controlled trials) representing 21 surgical studies containing 6140 patients met eligibility criteria. The mean patient age across studies reporting age was 49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 45-53) years with a mean intubation duration of 132 (95% CI, 106-159) minutes. Studies reported no injuries in 80% (95% CI, 69-88) of patients. All 21 studies presented on type of injury. Edema was the most frequently reported mild injury, with a prevalence of 9%-84%. Vocal fold hematomas were the most frequently reported moderate injury, with a prevalence of 4% (95% CI, 2-10). Severe injuries that include subluxation of the arytenoids and vocal fold paralysis are rare (<1%) outcomes. The most prevalent patient complaints postextubation were dysphagia (43%), pain (38%), coughing (32%), a sore throat (27%), and hoarseness (27%). Overall, laryngeal injury from short-duration surgical intubation is common and is most often mild. No uniform guidelines for laryngeal assessment postextubation from surgery are available and hoarseness is neither a good indicator of laryngeal injury or dysphagia.

There is an urgent and ever-increasing demand for serological COVID-19 antibody tests that are highly sensitive, quantitative, rapid, simple, minimally invasive, and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a single-step, wash-free immunoassay for rapid and highly sensitive quantitative analysis of serological human IgG against SARS-CoV-2 which requires only a single droplet of serum. By simply incubating 4 L human serum samples with antibody-functionalized gold nanoparticles, a photonic crystal optical biosensor coated with the recombinant spike protein serves as a sensing platform for the formation of sandwich immunocomplex through specific antigenCantibody interactions, upon which the detected IgG molecules can be counted with digital precision.

Surgery was performed in 24/32 patients (75.0%), with a mean delay time from admission to surgery of 6.0 5.6 days. Small bowel ischemia was confirmed to be the most common finding at surgical exploration (22/24, 91.7%). Acute abdomen at admission to the ED (Group 1) was observed in 10 (31.2%) cases, while 16 (50%) patients developed an acute abdomen condition during hospitalization (Group 2) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS Our literature review showed how intestinal ischemia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported all over the world. The majority of the patients have a high CCI with multiple comorbidities, above all hypertension and cardiovascular disease. GI symptoms were not always present at the admission. A high level of suspicion for intestinal ischemia should be maintained in COVID-19 patients presenting with GI symptoms or with incremental abdominal pain. Nevertheless, a prompt thromboelastogram and laboratory test may confirm the need of improving and fastening the use of anticoagulants and trigger an extended indication for early abdominal CECT in patients with suggestive symptoms or biochemical markers of intestinal ischemia.","output":"Acute intestinal ischemia in patients with COVID-19: single-centre experience and literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of August15, 2020, more than 21,155,600 people were infected and about 761,264 were expired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide.

Data were collected from 3 March 2020 to 25 October 2020, that is at the time when the alpha or delta variants were not dominant. METHODS A retrospective analysis of data on infected children in the st nad Labem Region collected by the Regional Public Health Authority along with questionnaire data reported by their families. Serological tests were performed in study volunteers. RESULTS The most common symptoms in children were headache, runny nose, and loss of smell and taste. The hospital admission rates were 0.8% in children and 2.4% in adults. The secondary transmission rate in families where the index case was a child reached 22.6%. It was higher when the index case was a child 11-15 years of age or asymptomatic. The secondary transmission rate in families where the index case was an adult equalled 77.1%. Children had higher IgG antibody levels than adults at post-infection months 4 and 5, but their seropositivity rate was comparable to that of adults. CONCLUSION Children have a nonspecific clinical course of the disease, which is quite similar as other viroses, and rarely require hospital admission. Secondary transmission in families where the index case was a child is not uncommon and is also possible through contact with an asymptomatic child. After recovery, children have higher levels of antibodies at post-infection months 4 and 5.","output":"Study of family clusters of COVID-19 in the st nad Labem Region with a focus on children - clinical picture, secondary transmission, antibody response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Instabilities and fluctuations of the plasma jet in a thermal spray process can have a significant influence on the particle in-flight temperatures and velocities, affecting the properties of resulting plasma-sprayed coatings. Presented in this paper is a novel method for capturing the effects particles are exposed to in the plasma spraying process. High-speed camera images of a plasma jet generated by a cascaded three-cathode plasma generator (TriplexPro-210) were recorded for varying operating conditions. The images are processed using the inverse Abel transform. This transformation accounts for the fact that the images represent a 2D projection of the 3D jet and generates more accurate intensity values that the sprayed particles would experience. These images are then combined with particle tracks resulting from CFD simulations of the plasma jet to match the particles path with the recorded plasma jet. This new method allows a precise description of the plasma intensity experienced by individual particles with a high temporal resolution. The results show a high sensitivity of the method, even detecting the influence on the particles of the plasma jet originating from the cascaded triple arc plasma generator, which is considered as rather stable.","output":"Capturing the Influence of Jet Fluctuations on Particles in Plasma Spraying"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is considered as the major polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) chemoattractant cytokine in lung diseases such as asthma and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This study examines the role of IL-8 in the recruitment and activation of PMNs in the lung of pneumonia patients. The interesting aspect of this study is that it is a site- specific analysis of the infected and uninfected lungs of the same patient. The level of IL-8 mRNA, protein and myeloperoxidase present in the cells of the bronchioalveolar lavages (BALs) taken from the areas of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) are compared with the BALs obtained from areas of no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung). The results obtained from the infected and non-infected lungs of pneumonic patients were further compared with that of a control group of non-smoking patients. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. There was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). This pattern was also consistent with MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung), indicating that IL-8 is directly implicated in neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.","output":"Levels of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase in the lungs of pneumonia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE REPORT Two dogs with an oesophageal foreign body (FB) were diagnosed with secondary pyothorax at the time of presentation.

However, barriers in accessing health care still exist in the US especially as it relates to some of the most vulnerable Americans including those with depressive disorders. The purpose of this cross-sectional secondary data analysis was to examine the differences in health-related quality of life for individuals with depressive disorders in early years of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as compared to later years of implementation. METHODS: This study used a repeated cross-sectional design that pooled data from the 2011C2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System which is a nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the before and after impact of the Affordable Care Act on health related quality of life for those with depressive disorders. RESULTS: Those with depressive disorders in early years of implementation of the Affordable Care Act were less likely to report 14 or more days of poor physical health (AOR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.98), were less likely to report 14 or more days of poor mental health (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.94), and less likely to report 14 or more days of overall poor physical and mental health (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.96) as opposed to later years of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate poorer health related quality of life for those with depressive disorders in later years of implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Measures of body composition including circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF%) were obtained from 240 healthy adults using LS and a diverse set of conventional methodsGulick tape, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and skinfolds. Convergent validity was consistently highindicating these methods vary proportionally and can thus reliably detect changes despite individual measurement differences. The span of the Limits of Agreement (LoA) using LS were comparable to the LoA between conventional methods. LS3D exhibited high agreement relative to Gulick tape in the measurement of WHR, despite poor agreement with individual waist and hip circumferences. In BF%, LS2D exhibited high agreement with BIA and skinfold methods, whereas LS3D demonstrated low agreement. Interestingly, the low inferred bias between LS3D and DXA using existing data suggests that LS3D may have high agreement with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

The present study aimed to evaluate anxiety levels of first year medical students and its correlation with academic factors during ERL. Methods ERL for neuroanatomy was conducted for six weeks mainly by online small group teaching. At completion, feedback was collected from students (n = 97) which included a GAD-7 questionnaire for anxiety levels and a modified VARK analysis to record changes in learning styles. Results Of 97 students (M46, F51) 43.30% had minimal, 31.96% mild, 10.31% moderate and 14.43% severe anxiety. Academic exchanges such as student-teacher interaction (80.41%), tutor feedback (90.72%) and mentor meetings (81.44%) were reported to be advantageous. There was a significant (p = 0.0056) correlation between enjoyment of small group discussion and lower GAD-7 scores. There was significant change in perceived learning styles during ERL.

Lack of electronic access to medical records across health care organizations impedes interhospital consultation and may lead to incomplete and delayed referrals. To improve referral management, we have established a multidisciplinary neuro-oncological triage panel (NOTP) with digital image exchange and determined the effects on lead times, costs, and time investment. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from February 2019 to March 2020. All newly diagnosed patients referred to Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam were analyzed according to referral pathway: (1) standard referral (SR), (2) NOTP. The primary outcome was lead time, defined as time-to-referral, time-to-treatment, and total time (median days [interquartile range]). Secondary outcomes were costs and time investment. RESULTS: In total, 225 patients were included, of whom 153 had SR and 72 NOTP referral. Patients discussed in the NOTP were referred more frequently for first neurosurgical consultation (44.7% vs 28.8%) or combined neurological and neurosurgical consultation (12.8% vs 2.5%, P = .002). Time-to-referral was reduced for NOTP referral compared to SR (1 [0.25-4] vs 6 [1.5-10] days, P < .001). Total time decreased from 27 [14-48] days for the standard group to 15 [12-38.25] days for the NOTP group (P = .040). Costs and time investment were comparable for both groups. CONCLUSION: Implementation of digital referral to a multidisciplinary NOTP is feasible and leads to more swift patient-tailored referrals at comparable costs and time investment as SR.

Findings revealed a complex social prescribing landscape, with schemes funded, structured, and delivered diversely. Stakeholders were in general agreement about the benefits of nature-based interventions, and GPs and volunteers pointed out numerous benefits to participating in schemes such as parkrun. Link Workers were more circumspect about suggesting outdoor activities, pointing out both psychological and practical obstacles, including health anxieties, mobility issues, and transport deficits.

While region B-C substitutions only had little or moderate effect on RdRP catalytic activities, virus proliferation was not supported by these substitutions in both virus systems. Importantly, a TBEV replicon-derived viral RNA replication was significantly reduced but not abolished by the substitution, suggesting the involvement of region B-C in viral and/or host processes beyond RdRP catalysis. A systematic structural analysis of region B-C in viral RdRPs further emphasizes its high level of structure and length diversity, providing a basis to further refine its relevance in RNA virus-host interactions in a general context.","output":"Crystal structure of a tick-borne flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase suggests a host adaptation hotspot in RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the early days of the COVID-19 crisis the scientific community has constantly been striving to shed light on various issues such as the mechanisms driving the spread of the virus, its environmental and socio-economic impacts, and necessary recovery and adaptation plans and policies. Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that is consisted of issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendation related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts on cities and major lessons for urban planning, design, and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report a case of a 21-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives for severe dysmenorrhea who presented with a hepatic mass and worsening right upper quadrant pain.

This pandemic also had a negative impact on standard procedures in general surgery. Surgeons were challenged to find the best treatment plans for patients with acute cholecystitis. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outcomes of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in a tertiary care hospital in Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined perioperative outcomes of patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the pandemic from March 22, 2020 (first national lockdown in Germany) to December 31, 2020. We then compared these to perioperative outcomes from the same time frame of the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the above-mentioned periods were enrolled. The pandemic group consisted of 100 and the control group of 82 patients. Subgroup analysis of elderly patients (> 65 years old) revealed significantly higher rates of acute [5 (17.9%) vs. 20 (58.8%); p = 0.001] and gangrenous cholecystitis [0 (0.0%) vs. 7 (20.6%); p = 0.013] in the pandemic subgroup. Furthermore, significantly more early cholecystectomies were performed in this subgroup [5 (17.9%) vs. 20 (58.8%); p = 0.001]. There were no significant differences between the groups both in the overall and subgroup analysis regarding the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients showed particularly higher rates of acute and gangrenous cholecystitis during the pandemic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in the COVID-19 era without negative impact on perioperative results. Therefore, we would assume that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be recommended for any patient with acute cholecystitis, including the elderly.","output":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in Germany: higher rates of acute and gangrenous cholecystitis in elderly patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Turkey is one of the countries affected during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of the current study is to investigate psychological resilience and depression in individuals during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to different variables.

Two parts of the study were as follows: (1) to assess the pre-experimental baseline aerosol count in the theatre environment where there are dynamic changes in temperature and humidity and (2) to measure aerosol generation with 23-gauge and 25-gauge set-up. For each porcine eye, five measurements were taken for each consecutive step in the experiment including pre-PPV, during PPV, fluid-air exchange (FAX) and venting using a flute with 23-gauge set-up and a chimney with 25-gauge set-up. Therefore, a total of 200 measurements were recorded. RESULTS With 23-gauge and 25-gauge PPV, there was no significant difference in aerosol generation in all six channels comparing pre-PPV versus PPV or pre-PPV versus FAX. Venting using flute with 23-gauge PPV showed significant reduction of aerosol 1 m. Air venting using chimney with 25-gauge set-up showed no significant difference in aerosol of 1 m. For cumulative aerosol counts of all particles measuring 5 m, compared with pre-PPV, PPV or FAX, flute venting in 23-gauge set-up showed significant reduction unlike the same comparison for chimney venting in 25-gauge set-up.

Predictive factors to distinguish COVID-19 from COVID-19 with bacterial coinfection or bloodstream infection are limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 595 COVID-19 patients admitted between March 8, 2020, and April 4, 2020, to describe factors associated with a bacterial bloodstream coinfection (BSI). The primary outcome was any characteristic associated with BSI in COVID-19, with secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality and days of antibiotic therapy (DOT) by antibiotic consumption (DOT/1000 patient-days). Variables of interest were compared between true BSI (n = 25) and all other COVID-19 cases (n = 570). A secondary comparison was performed between positive blood cultures with true BSI (n = 25) and contaminants (n = 33) on antibiotic use. RESULTS: Fever (> 38 C) (as a COVID-19 symptom) was not different between true BSI (n = 25) and all other COVID-19 patients (n = 570) (p = 0.93), although it was different as a reason for emergency department (ED) admission (p = 0.01). Neurological symptoms (ED reason or COVID-19 symptom) were significantly higher in the true BSI group (p < 0.01, p < 0.01) and were independently associated with true BSI (ED reason: OR = 3.27, p < 0.01; COVID-19 symptom: OR = 2.69, p = 0.03) on multivariate logistic regression. High (15C19.9  10(9)/L) white blood cell (WBC) count at admission was also higher in the true BSI group (p < 0.01) and was independently associated with true BSI (OR = 2.56, p = 0.06) though was not statistically significant. Thirty-day mortality was higher among true BSI (p < 0.01). Antibiotic consumption (DOT/1000 patient-days) between true BSI and contaminants was not different (p = 0.34). True bloodstream coinfection was 4.2% (25/595) over the 28-day period. CONCLUSION: True BSI in COVID-19 was associated with neurological symptoms and nonsignificant higher WBC, and led to overall higher 30-day mortality and worse patient outcomes.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%).

Changes in APA have also been measured during the activation of the RAS in the Goldblatt hypertension model and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rat. The DSS rat shows an elevation in renal APA activity at the onset of hypertension suggesting a protective role against elevations in circulating AngII, followed by decreased APA activity with advancing hypertension. Changes seen in human maternal serum APA activity during preeclampsia are similar to changes measured in renal APA in the DSS rat model. APA activity is higher than during normal pregnancy at the onset of preeclampsia, and with advancing preeclampsia (severe preeclampsia) declines below that seen during normal pregnancy. Serum APA activity is also increased during hormone replacement therapy (HRT), perhaps in reaction to elevated levels of AngII.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the relationship between the presence of firearms and perceived home or neighborhood safety is fixed or depends on additional factors and to identify the additional factors on which it depends. METHODS: A mixed-methods cross-sectional analysis of the 2018 state-representative California Safety and Wellbeing Survey (n = 2558, completion rate 49%), including calculation of weighted proportions and qualitative analysis of write-in responses. FINDINGS: One in six respondents (17.2%, 95% CI 14.9% to 19.7%) reported it depends when asked whether a gun in their home made the home a safer or more dangerous place to be (the home scenario). One in six (16.6%, 95% CI 14.3% to 19.2%) reported it depends when asked whether the neighborhood would be safer if all neighbors had guns in the home (the neighborhood scenario). For the home scenario, 28.3% (95% CI 21.9% to 35.7%) cited firearm owner characteristics (e.g., training and proficiency, temperament, and mental health), 28.4% (95% CI 22.3% to 35.5%) cited firearm storage and access, and 28.0% (95% CI 21.5% to 35.7%) cited intended use for guns as factors affecting perceived safety. For the neighborhood scenario, respondents overwhelmingly cited gun owner characteristics (72.1%, 95% CI 63.4% to 79.3%). Factors on which it depends varied by gun ownership status.

PNT was previously postulated to be localized to the highly divergent mitochondrion-related organelle, the mitosome, in the anaerobic/microaerophilic protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica based on the potential mitochondrion-targeting signal. However, our previous proteomic study of isolated phagosomes suggested that PNT is localized to organelles other than mitosomes. An immunofluorescence assay using anti-E. histolytica PNT (EhPNT) antibody raised against the NADH-binding domain showed a distribution to the membrane of numerous vesicles/vacuoles, including lysosomes and phagosomes. The domain(s) required for the trafficking of PNT to vesicles/vacuoles was examined by using amoeba transformants expressing a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated PNTs fused with green fluorescent protein or a hemagglutinin tag. All truncated PNTs failed to reach vesicles/vacuoles and were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data indicate that the putative targeting signal is not sufficient for the trafficking of PNT to the vesicular/vacuolar compartments and that full-length PNT is necessary for correct transport. PNT displayed a smear of >120 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. PNGase F and tunicamycin treatment, chemical degradation of carbohydrates, and heat treatment of PNT suggested that the apparent aberrant mobility of PNT is likely attributable to its hydrophobic nature. PNT that is compartmentalized to the acidic compartments is unprecedented in eukaryotes and may possess a unique physiological role in E. histolytica.","output":"Localization and targeting of an unusual pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase in Entamoeba histolytica."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents current data about the perinatal effects of prolonged stress on pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years in aesthetic medicine, there has been a steadily increasing popularity of the use of various fillers in order to correct aesthetic imperfections and age-related changes. Traditionally, the most widely used fillers are based on hyaluronic acid due to their high safety profile, biocompatibility, a wide range of indications and the presence of an antidote in the form of hyaluronidase preparations. However, in some cases, a late complication such as a delayed inflammatory response may occur. Various triggering factors can lead to its appearance, including influenza-like illnesses, and also coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Objective. The article provides a detailed description of the occurrence of a delayed inflammatory reaction in the localization of a filler based on hyaluronic acid against the background of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), as well as analyzes clinical cases presented in scientific publications. Material and methods. A 49-year-old female patient complained of recurrent inflammation in the areas of injection of a filler based on hyaluronic acid. For the first time, the onset of an inflammatory reaction occurred against the background of the COVID-19 disease. Results. After additional examination methods (ultrasound of the skin and soft tissues of the face), a diagnosis was made and therapy was prescribed (antibiotics, dexamethasone per os for a long time, enzymatic resorption of the filler by hyaluronidase, external therapy: tacrolimus). Conclusions. Delayed inflammatory responses of hyaluronic acid fillers, despite the rarity of occurrence, are currently the focus of attention. The worldwide interest in this problem is associated with the etiology and pathogenesis of their occurrence, which are complex and multifactorial and are not fully understood.

The soil pHBC and the changes in soil pH, Eh, Fe2+, Mn2+, SO42- and Cd speciation were determined. The results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pHBC of these paddy soils, indicating that soil CEC is a key factor affecting the pHBC of paddy soils. The contribution of Fe(III) oxide reduction to H+ consumption is far greater than the reduction of Mn(IV)/Mn(III) oxides and SO42- during the submerging. For example, the contribution of the reduction of manganese oxides, SO42- and iron oxides to H+ consumption in the paddy soils from Anthrosol at 15 d submerging was 1.2%, 11.6% and 87.2%, respectively. This confirms that the reduction of Fe(III) oxides plays a leading role in increasing soil pH. Importantly, we noticed that during submerging, soil pH was increased and resulted in the content of available Cd in soils being reduced. This was due to the transformation of Cd to less active forms. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between the change rate of available Cd, the percentage of acid extractable Cd and pH variation. This suggests that the variation in soil pH was responsible for the transformation of Cd speciation. In addition, the change rate of available Cd and the percentage of acid extractable Cd concentration were significantly negatively correlated with soil pHBC. The soil with higher pHBC experienced less pH change, and thus the change rate of available Cd and the percentage of acid extractable Cd concentration were less for the soil. The results of this study can provide a basis for the remediation of Cd-contaminated acidic paddy soils.","output":"Effects of pH variations caused by redox reactions and pH buffering capacity on Cd(II) speciation in paddy soils during submerging/draining alternation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of dietary patterns and the commensal microbiome on susceptibility to and severity of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has been largely ignored to date.

The objective of this study was to assess the well-being, resilience, burnout, and wellness factors and needs of EM physicians and advanced practice providers (e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants; APPs) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, cohort survey study of EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fishers Exact, and logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85 to 61% (p < 0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66 to 32% (p < 0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p = 0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected > 50% of respondents initially without significant change (p = 0.05 and p = 0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.82C5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10C5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four weeks (30 to 14%; p = 0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30 to 22%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: This survey of frontline EM providers, including physicians and APPs, during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, putting many at risk for burnout.

However, no specific drugs were currently proven. This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/SARS-CoV. Random-effects network meta-analysis within the Bayesian framework was performed, followed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system assessing the quality of evidence. The primary outcome of interest includes mortality, cure, viral negative conversion, and overall adverse events (OAEs). Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as the measure of effect size. RESULTS: Sixty-six RCTs with 19,095 patients were included, involving standard of care (SOC), eight different antiviral agents, six different antibiotics, high and low dose chloroquine (CQ_HD, CQ_LD), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), corticosteroids (COR), and other treatments. Compared with SOC, a significant reduction of mortality was observed for TCM (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20C0.56, moderate quality) and COR (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75C0.96, low quality) with improved cure rate (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.60C2.91, low quality for TCM; OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.05C1.30, low quality for COR). However, an increased risk of mortality was found for CQ_HD vs. SOC (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.18C8.73, low quality). TCM was associated with decreased risk of OAE (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.38C0.70, very low quality) but CQ_HD (OR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.20C5.24) and interferons (IFN) (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.02C7.08) vs. SOC with very low quality were associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: COR and TCM may reduce mortality and increase cure rate with no increased risk of OAEs compared with standard care. CQ_HD might increase the risk of mortality.

Methods and FindingsFrom 8th March to 29th November 2020, we produced weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission. The estimates and forecasts were based on an ensemble model comprising of three models that were calibrated using only the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each country. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility and potential changes in population immunity due to infection to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. ConclusionsDuring the 39-week period covered by this study, we produced short- and medium-term forecasts for 81 countries. Both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon.

METHODS: A data set was constructed cataloguing 846 policies across 178 health systems in total, 37 of which had major epidemics within the last 20 years. Hypothesis testing used OLS regressions with World Health Organization region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. RESULTS: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was associated with providing earlier response in the following policy categories: all policies, surveillance/response, distancing, and international travel policies. The effect was about 6C10 days earlier response. The significance of this variable was largely nullified with the addition of the other two independent variables. Neither total cases nor years since previous epidemics showed no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that health systems may learn from past major epidemics.

Of the 47 participants with positive NP swabs, 66% also had positive IgG serology. Of the 99 participants with negative NP swabs who underwent blood sample collection, 5% had positive IgG serology results. Of the 29 participants who presented with at least 3 major symptoms, 15 (52%) had positive NP swabs and 14 (48%) had positive serology. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that evidence of symptoms, even when major, is a poor predictor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in health care workers and raises the question of the best way to efficiently screen this population especially during the upcoming flu period.","output":"Moderate forms of COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a Belgian hospital and their immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Social media is a powerful networking tool among health care organizations. This study determines correlations between program reputation and social media activity and popularity, specifically among otolaryngology residency programs. METHODS Accredited programs, excluding military and osteopathic, in the United States were included. Activity and popularity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were assessed during the same 7-month period from 2016 to 2020. Doximity Residency reputation scores (dividing programs into quartiles) and US News & World Report (comparing programs affiliated with top hospitals versus those with unranked hospitals) were utilized to compare differences based on reputation. RESULTS Of 104 programs, 91 (88%) had social media accounts. Instagram and Twitter were more commonly used than Facebook, with 78 (75%), 49 (47%), and 42 (40%) accounts, respectively. The cumulative use of all three platforms grew yearly, while Twitter (R2 = 0.9863) and Instagram (R2 = 0.9955) presence increased exponentially. Doximity's top quartile programs had more Facebook (P = .020), Twitter (P < .001), and Instagram (P = .102) accounts. First-quartile programs also adopted each platform months before fourth-quartile programs. Stratified by US News & World Report, ranked programs had more social media accounts, with 24 (53%) on Facebook (P = .028), 32 (71%) on Twitter (P < .001), and 37 (82%) on Instagram (P = .155). Programs with higher reputations were more active and exhibited increased likes and followers over time. CONCLUSION Social media use among otolaryngology programs has grown exponentially, with Instagram and Twitter becoming the dominant platforms. Higher ranked programs are more active on social media, have more followers, and adopt social media earlier.

We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for liver injury in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan by retrospectively analyzing the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data for 218 COVID-19 patients and identifying the risk factors for liver injury by multivariate analysis. AIM: To investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for liver injury in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. METHODS: The 218 patients included 94 males (43.1%), aged 22 to 94 (50.1  18.4) years. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were present in 42 (53.2%) and 36 (45.6%) cases, respectively, and 79 (36.2%) patients had abnormally elevated transaminase levels at admission. Patients with liver injury were older than those with normal liver function by a median of 12 years, with a significantly higher frequency of males (68.4% vs 28.8%, P < 0.001) and more coexisting illnesses (48.1% vs 27.3%, P = 0.002). Significantly more patients had fever and shortness of breath (87.3% vs 69.8% and 29.1% vs 14.4%, respectively) in the liver injury group. Only 12 (15.2%) patients had elevated total bilirubin. ALT and AST levels were mildly elevated [1-3  upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 86.1% and 92.9% of cases, respectively. Only two (2.5%) patients had an ALT or AST level > 5  ULN. Elevated -glutamyl transpeptidase was present in 45 (57.0%) patients, and 86.7% of these had a -glutamyl-transpeptidase level < 135 U/L (3  ULN). Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were almost normal in all patients. Patients with severe liver injury had a significantly higher frequency of abnormal transaminases than non-severe patients, but only one case had very high levels of aminotransferases. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, high D-dimer level, and high neutrophil percentage were linked to a higher risk of liver injury. The early stage of COVID-19 may be associated with mildly elevated aminotransferase levels in patients in Wuhan. Male sex and high D-dimer level and neutrophil percentage may be important predictors of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Male sex and high D-dimer level and neutrophil percentage may be important predictors of liver injury in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Clinical characteristics and risk factors for liver injury in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Public health (PH) practitioners have a strong moral commitment to health equity and social justice. However, PH values often do not align with health systems values, making it challenging for PH practitioners to promote health equity. In spite of a growing range of PH ethics frameworks and theories, little is known about ethical concerns related to promotion of health equity in PH practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical concerns of PH practitioners in promoting health equity in the context of mental health promotion and prevention of harms of substance use. METHODS As part of a broader program of public health systems and services research, we interviewed 32 PH practitioners. RESULTS Using constant comparative analysis, we identified four systemic ethical tensions: [1] biomedical versus social determinants of health agenda; [2] systems driven agendas versus situational care; [3] stigma and discrimination versus respect for persons; and [4] trust and autonomy versus surveillance and social control. CONCLUSIONS Naming these tensions provides insights into the daily ethical challenges of PH practitioners and an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of PH frameworks. These findings highlight the value of relational ethics as a promising approach for developing ethical frameworks for PH practice.","output":"\\"The health equity curse\\": ethical tensions in promoting health equity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Fever is a very common reason for emergency consultation during pregnancy, and may be associated with maternal, obstetrical and/or fetal adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies and to analyze the maternal or fetal complications of fever in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single center study including all patients who consulted for fever above 38 C during pregnancy in the gynecological emergency ward from August 2016 to July 2017. RESULTS: A total of 100 pregnant women who consulted for fever were included. The etiologies were common viral infections (37%), influenza (21%), pyelonephritis (11%), viral gastroenteritis (6%), chorioamnionitis (5%), other (5%). The etiology was unknown for 15%. Fever was confirmed during consultation in 45/100 patients (45%). Among patients with confirmed fever, 21/45 (47%) were hospitalized with a median stay of 3 days [IQR 2-4] and 10/45(22%) developed fetal or maternal complications. Probabilistic antibiotics were delivered for 34/45, 76% patients. Only 14/45, 31% had confirmed bacterial infections. Of the 32 patients with confirmed fever who had no etiologic diagnosis at the initial work-up in the emergency room, 19/32, 59% received presumptive treatment with amoxicillin against Listeria monocytogenes. None had confirmed listeriosis, and all were probably common viral infections. Among all patients, the complications rate was 13% and 22% in the subgroup with fever confirmed at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the main etiologies and complications of fever during pregnancy. A challenge is to reduce excessive antibiotic use by improving rapid diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections.

However, the expression and purification of membrane protein structure is difficult despite tremendous progress. In this study, the 3 D structure is modeled followed by intensive validation and molecular dynamics simulation. The lack of suitable homologous templates (>30% sequence identities) leads us to construct the membrane protein models using template-free modeling (de novo or ab initio) approach with Robetta and trRosetta servers. Comparing with other model structures, it is evident that trRosetta (TM-score: 0.64; TM region RMSD: 2 ?) can provide the best model than Robetta (TM-score: 0.61; TM region RMSD: 3.3 ?) and I-TASSER (TM-score: 0.45; TM region RMSD: 6.5 ?). 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the model structures by incorporating membrane environment.

Finally, trRosetta model is utilized for interpretation and visualization of interacting residues during protein-protein interactions. The common interacting residues including Phe103, Arg107, Met109, Trp110, Arg131, and Glu135 in the C-terminal domain of M protein are identified in membrane-spike and membrane-nucleocapsid protein complexes.

Therefore, we conducted a geospatial and hot spot analysis to examine the association between villages with high TST-positive prevalence (?6.5%) and access to medical care (distance (in kilometres and minutes of travel time) to the municipal Rural Health Units (RHU)), access to healthcare resources (distance to Provincial Health Office (PHO)) and socioeconomic determinants of health. Hot spot analysis revealed significant clusters of TST-positive prevalence in villages farthest from the PHO. Based on univariate analysis, the following variables associated with high prevalence were included in the multivariate model: minutes of travel time to the PHO, distance to the PHO, island villages and total deprivation based on socioeconomic indicators. In the final model, only distance to PHO in minutes was significant (P = 0.005). When evaluated further, greater than 1-hour drive significantly increased risk for TST-positivity (P = 0.003).

Biomarkers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and variations in white blood cells for inflammation, and serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for myocardial injury are examined. METHODS A total of 105 patients undergoing PCI were included and randomly divided into two groups: control (treated with routine hydration therapy) and PCr (treated with additional intravenous infusion of exogenous PCr). The serum levels of biomarkers were detected at administration and 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after PCI, with natural logarithmic (loge) transformation of data when modeling assumptions were not fulfilled. RESULTS The level of loge-transformed IL-6 increased in both groups, especially at 12 and 24 h after the operation, and that of PCr group was less than the control group at 48 h. The content of loge-transformed cTnI was significantly increased in both groups, while that of the PCr group was markedly lower than the control group at all time points after PCI. Moreover, the ratio of neutrophils was elevated at all time points after PCI, while that of the PCr group was lower at 48 h, and the variations in the ratio of lymphocytes showed opposite results.

They were enrolled at the time of their admission to CFLTCs and were followed up for three months after discharge. The discharged patients were followed up at regular intervals of three weeks and three months by telephonic interview using a structured proforma. RESULTS: Out of the 154 patients followed up, 57 (37%) were men and 97 (63%) were women. The mean (SD) age of study participants was 31.49 (18.4) years. At least one symptom was present in 120 (78.0%) patients at the time of admission. Cough (29, 18.8%), fever (26, 16.8%), headache (25, 16.2%), rhinitis (23,14.9%) and sore throat (18, 11.7%) were the major symptoms reported at the time of admission.

Updated disease state durations were incorporated into a simulation model to examine the importance of addressing preclinical transmission in the face of robust response measures. Simulation of FMD outbreaks in the US pig production sector demonstrated that including a preclinical infectious period of one day would result in a 40% increase in the median number of farms affected (166 additional farms and 664,912 pigs euthanized) compared to the scenario of no preclinical transmission, assuming suboptimal outbreak response.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the aforementioned classic psychedelic substances conferred lowered odds of OUD. Furthermore, this study aimed to replicate and extend findings from Pisano et al. (2017) who found classic psychedelic use to be linked to lowered odds of OUD in a nationally representative sample.

Lifetime psilocybin use was associated with lowered odds of OUD (aOR: 0.70; 95% CI [0.60, 0.83]). No other substances, including other classic psychedelics, were associated with lowered odds of OUD. Additionally, sensitivity analyses revealed psilocybin use to be associated with lowered odds of seven of the 11 DSM-IV criteria for OUD (aOR range: 0.66C0.83).

Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. These require, however, that some pseudonymised data be stored on a central server, which privacy advocates have cautioned against. We contend that their influential arguments are subject to two fallacies. First, they have tended to one-sidedly focus on the risks that centralised data storage entails for privacy, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that inefficient contact tracing involves ethical risks too. Second, while the envisioned system does entail risks of breaches, such risks are also present in decentralised systems, which have been falsely presented as privacy preserving by design. When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.","output":"Without a trace: Why did corona apps fail?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ocular surface has been suggested as a site of infection with Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) responsible for the coronavirus disease\\\\19 (COVID\\\\19).

SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme\\\\2 (ACE2) to facilitate infection in humans. This review sets out to evaluate evidence for the ocular surface as a route of infection. A literature search in this area was conducted on 15 April 2020 using the Scopus database. In total, 287 results were returned and reviewed. There is preliminary evidence for ACE2 expression on corneal and conjunctival cells, but most of the other receptors to which coronaviruses bind appear to be found under epithelia of the ocular surface. Evidence from animal studies is limited, with a single study suggesting viral particles on the eye can travel to the lung, resulting in very mild infection. Coronavirus infection is rarely associated with conjunctivitis, with occasional cases reported in patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19, along with isolated cases of conjunctivitis as a presenting sign. Coronaviruses have been rarely isolated from tears or conjunctival swabs. The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection. Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect. Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19.

This study aims at overcoming this gap in research by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the years to come. We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world's demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards' harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts.

METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients with midline incisional hernias were prospectively included in the study. Three groups according to the transverse diameter of the defect [group A (<4 cm, N = 18), group B (4-10 cm, N = 59), and group C (>10 cm, N = 23)] were identified. RESULTS Components separation was necessary in 54% of the patients: 16.7% (3/18) in group A, 59.3% (35/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C. Complete tension-free reconstruction was achieved in 87% of the patients: 94.4% (17/18) in group A, 91.5% (54/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C.

Sequencing cost remains a major concern in sequencing-based study, although the application of next generation sequencing has dramatically decreased the sequencing cost and increased the efficiency. The choice of sequencing depth and the sequencing sample size will largely determine the final study investment and performance. Many studies have been conducted to find a cost-effective design of sequencing depth that can achieve certain sequencing accuracy using minimal sequencing cost. The strategies previously studied can be classified into two groups: (1) single-stage to sequence all the samples using either high (>~30) or low (<~10) sequencing depth; and (2) two-stage to sequence an affordable number of individuals at a high-coverage followed by a large sample of low-coverage sequencing. However, limited studies examined the performance of the medium-coverage (10C30) sequencing depth for a genetic association study, where the optimum sequencing depth may exist. In this study, using a published simulation framework, we comprehensively compared the medium-coverage sequencing (MCS) to the single- and two-stage high/low-coverage sequencing in terms of the power and type I error of the variant discovery and association testing. We found, given certain sequencing effort, MCS yielded a comparable discovery power and better type I error control compared with the best (highest power) scenarios using other high- and low-coverage single-stage or two-stage designs.

To this end, viruses have adopted several strategies to harness cellular metabolism in accordance with their specific demands. Most viruses upregulate specific cellular anabolic pathways and are largely dependent on such alterations. RNA viruses, for example, upregulate both glycolysisand glycogenolysis providing TCA cycle intermediates essential for anabolic lipogenesis. Also, these infections usually induce the PPP, leading to increased nucleotide levels supporting viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)that has so far spread from China throughout the world is also an RNA virus. Owing to the more metabolic plasticity of uninfected cells, a promising approach for specific antiviral therapy, which has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years, would be the targeting of metabolic changes induced by viruses.

Established processes for patients to complete symptom screening using PROs were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the implementation of a Radiation Therapist led champion model to support the use of PROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patient charts were audited May 3 to May 22, 2020 to measure the initial impact of the pandemic on weekly completion rates of PROs for patients receiving active radiation treatment. Beginning May 25, 2020, two Radiation Therapists acted as champions to promote the use of PROs among patients and staff. Weekly completion rates of PROs were monitored from May 25, 2020 to May 28, 2021. The type of Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) utilized and treatment intent was also recorded. RESULTS: After implementing the champion model, the weekly completion of PROs increased to an average of 47.0  11.7 (47.5  12.6%) from the initial baseline average of 8.7  1.5 (9.4  2.1%). For PROs completed, the distribution of PROMs was an average of 37.2  9.6 (47.7  12.7%) and 9.8  3.5 (47.0  16.9%) for the Revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-r) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) respectively. An average of 5.1  2.9 (26.3  12.7%) and 41.9  10.1 (52.4  14.1%) was recorded for palliative and curative intent respectively. DISCUSSION: An increased number of PROs were completed after implementing the Radiation Therapist led champion model. Patients receiving a radical course of treatment more frequently completed PROs, which in part reflects the longer treatment courses with increased opportunity for PROs to be completed. CONCLUSION: The Radiation Therapist led champion model supported ongoing monitoring and completion of PROs during the COVID-19 pandemic and has now been integrated into the department's standard clinical practice.","output":"Improving the Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes Among Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The South African unemployment rate is 29 1%, this is the highest unemployment rate that the country has recorded since the 1970s The country is in the top ten countries with the highest unemployment rates in the world COVID-19 threatens to increase the unemployment rate above the 50% mark A public policy intervention is the most suitable instrument for the country in order to address this problem, however, policy is reliant on accurate and reliable forecasting This paper explores univariate machine learning techniques to forecast the South African unemployment rate Six traditional statistical models are compared with seven machine learning models The multi-layer perceptron achieves the lowest error rate, whilst the ridge regression model achieved the highest R - squared These are closely followed by ARIMA, LASSO, and the elastic net, showing that machine learning models can forecast the South African unemployment rate with higher accuracy than traditional statistical methods ? 2020 IEEE","output":"An Exploration of Machine Learning Models to Forecast the Unemployment Rate of South Africa: A Univariate Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report the results and complications of a single-center experience of above-the-knee angioplasty via transradial access (TRA).

This project aimed to determine how patients and clinicians perceived telephone consultations in the neuro-oncology service compared to traditional face to face appointments. METHOD: A 20-question patient satisfaction survey combined quantitative and qualitative questions and was distributed between June and August 2020. These were distributed by email to 88 patients who attended neuro-oncology clinic in person (\\"face-to-face\\"), or by telephone. Concurrently, a 15-question survey was distributed to all clinicians conducting telephone and face-to-face consultations for the neuro-oncology service. Questions included in the clinician survey were designed to mirror the patient satisfaction questionnaire where possible. Fisher's exact test was used to determine significance, which was set at p< 0.05. RESULTS: 51.1% (n=45) of patients returned the questionnaire. Of those who received telephone appointments, 89.5% (n=17) felt the consultation was convenient, 94.7% (n=18) were satisfied and 80.0% (n=16) were able to have a family member/friend present. Of those who attended face-to-face appointments, 96.0% (n=24) felt their consultation was convenient, 100% (n=25) were satisfied and 87.5% (n=21) were able to have a family member/friend present. There was no significant difference in patient convenience, satisfaction or family/friend presence (p=0.395, p=0.432 and p=0.498 respectively) between face-to-face and telephone clinics. Overall, the clinicians reported undertaking a mean of 9.5 telephone consultations per week. Only 42.8% (n=3) use telephone appointments for first-time neuro-oncology consultations, whereas 100.0% (n=7) use them for results and follow-up appointments. Only 51.7% (n=4) felt that undertaking telephone consultations is convenient and 42.8% (n=3) have experienced difficult situations with patients during telephone consultation. CONCLUSION: This project suggests that neuro-oncology telephone consultations provide patients with the same level of satisfaction and convenience as face-to-face appointments. We have also demonstrated that using the telephone does not provide a significant barrier to having family or friends present to support the patient. We have shown that clinicians are universally utilising neuro-oncology telephone appointments for follow-up and results whereas much fewer use the telephone for performing initial consultations. Given the high-level of satisfaction demonstrated in the patient questionnaires this reflects effective patient-selection for remote consultations. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced oncology services to evolve and results of this project suggest that telephone neuro-oncology consultations are widely accepted by patients and clinicians. We therefore propose that remote consultations should continue beyond the pandemic in select cases.","output":"Telephone versus face-to-face neuro-oncology consultations: comparing patient satisfaction, convenience, family support and clinician attitude during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 represents a great source of concern and a new threat for immunocompromised patients.

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION We included articles that described randomized trials of 1 or more explicit values clarification methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS Compared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-incongruent choices (risk difference, -0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.06 to -0.02; P < 0.001) and decisional conflict (standardized mean difference, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.11; P < 0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (2 = 9.25, P = 0.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (2 = 6.08, P = 0.05). LIMITATIONS Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity.

For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. METHODS The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as 75% agreement and strong consensus as 95% agreement, and agreement as a score 7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. RECOMMENDATIONS Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear.

Natural origin and eco-friendly background encourage the search of novel materials with such features, such as polyhydroxyoctanoate (P(3HO)), a polyester of bacterial origin. Physicochemical features of both P(3HO) and PLA have an impact on cellular response 32, i.e., adhesion, migration, and cell morphology, based on the signaling and changes in the architecture of the three cytoskeletal networks: microfilaments (F-actin), microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IF). To investigate the role of IF in the cellular response to the substrate, we focused on vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs), present in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF). VIFs maintain cell integrity and protect it from external mechanical stress, and also take part in the transmission of signals from the exterior of the cell to its inner organelles, which is under constant investigation. Physiochemical properties of a substrate have an impact on cells morphology, and thus on cytoskeleton network signaling and assembly. In this work, we show how PLA and P(3HO) crystallinity and hydrophilicity influence VIFs, and we identify that two different types of vimentin cytoskeleton architecture: network classic and nutshell-like are expressed by MEFs in different numbers of cells depending on substrate features.","output":"Vimentin Cytoskeleton Architecture Analysis on Polylactide and Polyhydroxyoctanoate Substrates for Cell Culturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The measurement and identification of changes in the social structure in response to an exceptional event like COVID-19 can facilitate a more informed public response to the pandemic and provide fundamental insights on how collective social processes respond to extreme events. Objective: In this study, we built a generalized framework for applying social media data to understand public behavioral and emotional changes in response to COVID-19. Methods: Utilizing a complete dataset of Sina Weibo posts published by users in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020, we constructed a time-varying social network of 3.5 million users. In combination with community detection, text analysis, and sentiment analysis, we comprehensively analyzed the evolution of the social network structure, as well as the behavioral and emotional changes across four main stages of Wuhan's experience with the epidemic. Results: The empirical results indicate that almost all network indicators related to the network's size and the frequency of social interactions increased during the outbreak. The number of unique recipients, average degree, and transitivity increased by 24, 23, and 19% during the severe stage than before the outbreak, respectively. Additionally, the similarity of topics discussed on Weibo increased during the local peak of the epidemic. Most people began discussing the epidemic instead of the more varied cultural topics that dominated early conversations. The number of communities focused on COVID-19 increased by nearly 40 percent of the total number of communities. Finally, we find a statistically significant rebound effect by exploring the emotional content of the users' posts through paired sample t-test (P = 0.003).

METHOD: To audit this new way of working, feedback was collected from the doctors, interpreters, individuals being assessed, and senior medical and legal staff who reviewed the reports. This paper presents findings from the first 20 assessments. RESULTS: Individuals assessed reported that the doctor developed good rapport, but in 35% of assessments reported that there were some experiences they felt unable to disclose. In 70% of assessments, doctors felt that rapport was not as good compared to face-to-face. In the majority of assessments, doctors were unable to gain a full account of the torture or its impact. They reported feeling cautious about pressing for more information on the telephone, mindful of individuals' vulnerability and the difficulty of providing support remotely. Nevertheless, in 85% of assessments doctors felt able to assess the consistency of the account of torture with the psychological findings, in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol (United Nations, 2004). Factors that hindered the assessment included the inability to observe body language, the person's ill health, and confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSION: This research indicates that psychological medico-legal reports can safely be produced by telephone assessment, but are more likely to be incomplete in terms of both full disclosure of torture experiences and psychological assessment. The limitations underline the need for a follow-up face-to-face assessment to expand the psychological assessment as well as undertake a physical assessment.","output":"Remote medico-legal assessment by telephone during COVID-19: Monitoring safety and quality when documenting evidence of torture for UK asylum applicants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted on the health and wellbeing of populations directly through infection, as well as through serious societal and economic consequences such as unemployment and underemployment. The consequences could be even more severe for those more vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Indeed, there is evidence that such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact. The aim of our study was to determine whether occupational health (OH) professionals thought that the COVID-19 pandemic might further disadvantage any particular group(s) of vulnerable workers globally, and if so, which group(s). A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of OH professionals by means of an online questionnaire which was shared via email within the ICOH (International Commission for Occupational Health) community. Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020 and 165 responses from 52 countries were received. In this paper, the responses relating to questions about vulnerable workers are reported and discussed. Globally, our responders felt that those in less secure jobs (precarious employment (79%) and informal work (69%)), or unemployed (63%), were the most at risk of further disadvantage from this pandemic. The majority felt that their governments could act to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support, as well as calls for fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations so vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19.","output":"Vulnerable Workers and COVID-19: Insights from a Survey of Members of the International Commission for Occupational Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most vaccines require multiple doses to induce long-lasting protective immunity in a high frequency of vaccines, and to ensure strong both individual and herd immunity. Repetitive immunogenic stimulations not only increase the intensity and durability of adaptive immunity, but also influence its quality. Several vaccine parameters are known to influence adaptive immune responses, including notably the number of immunizations, the delay between them, and the delivery sequence of different recombinant vaccine vectors. Furthermore, the initial effector innate immune response is key to activate and modulate B and T cell responses. Optimization of homologous and heterologous prime/boost vaccination strategies requires a thorough understanding of how vaccination history affects memory B and T cell characteristics. This requires deeper knowledge of how innate cells respond to multiple vaccine encounters. Here, we review how innate cells, more particularly those of the myeloid lineage, sense and respond differently to a 1st and a 2nd vaccine dose, both in an extrinsic and intrinsic manner. On one hand, the presence of primary specific antibodies and memory T cells, whose critical properties change with time after priming, provides a distinct environment for innate cells at the time of re-vaccination. On the other hand, innate cells themselves can exert enhanced intrinsic antimicrobial functions, long after initial stimulation, which is referred to as trained immunity. We discuss the potential of trained innate cells to be game-changers in prime/boost vaccine strategies. Their increased functionality in antigen uptake, antigen presentation, migration, and as cytokine producers, could indeed improve the restimulation of primary memory B and T cells and their differentiation into potent secondary memory cells in response to the boost. A better understanding of trained immunity mechanisms will be highly valuable for harnessing the full potential of trained innate cells, to optimize immunization strategies.","output":"Optimize Prime/Boost Vaccine Strategies: Trained Immunity as a New Player in the Game"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article outlines the future of decentralized blockchain scholarship and some ethical questions we must consider in its wake.

We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events. In light of these estimated impacts, and because olfactory tests can be mass produced at low cost and self-administered, we suggest that screening for olfactory dysfunction could be a high impact and cost-effective method for broad COVID-19 screening and surveillance.","output":"Modeling the effectiveness of olfactory testing to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyses and presents accounting academics experiences in six universities in Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia to adapt to the swift change to the remote virtual classroom delivery model forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, while also gaining valuable lessons from this unique situation In this study, autoethnographys basic principles were used The main results suggest that the universities combined current information and communication technologies, learning management systems, blended learning experiences, training, and supports, although not without hitches, were able to accommodate the shift to a remote virtual classroom model quite effectively However, the move to fully online assessment has been conceded to likely increase the embedded risk of student cheating The availability of reliable internet connection for students is also crucial in ensuring access equality and effective remote virtual classroom delivery ? 2021 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors","output":"Australian, malaysian and indonesian accounting academics teaching experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustaining patient portal use is a major problem for many healthcare organizations and providers.

The analysis of data collected from 177 patients at a major medical center in the Midwestern region of the United States shows that health professional encouragement helps increase the continuous use intention and deep structure usage of the patient portal, while security concerns impede them. Interestingly, health professional encouragement not only has a direct positive influence on continuous use intention and deep structure usage but also lowers the negative impact of security concerns on them. The research model explains a substantial variance in continuous use intention (i.e., 40%) and deep structure usage (i.e., 32%).

Methods The methodology includes geotagging COVID-19 cases to understand the trans-mobility areas for COVID-19 and characterize risk. The hotspot analysis technique was used to identify the number of areas in danger zones and the number of people affected by COVID-19. The complete lockdown areas were markdown geographically to be selected by the government of Pakistan based on increased numbers of cases. Results The overall result is that 9.2 million people are COVID-19 infected by 20 October 2020 in Punjab Province.

We generated a model that allows the safe reproduction of clinical studies on the application of pathogens to human skin and elucidated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on human skin. METHODS: We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV), mixed with culture medium or upper respiratory mucus, on human skin surfaces and the dermal disinfection effectiveness of 80% (weight/weight) ethanol against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were inactivated more rapidly on skin surfaces than on other surfaces (stainless steel/glass/plastic); the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV (9.04 hours [95% confidence interval, 7.96C 10.2 hours] vs 1.82 hours [1.65C2.00 hours]). IAV on other surfaces was inactivated faster in mucus versus medium conditions, while SARS-CoV-2 showed similar stability in the mucus and medium; the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV (11.09 hours [10.22C12.00 hours] vs 1.69 hours [1.57C1.81 hours]). Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in the mucus/medium on human skin were completely inactivated within 15 seconds by ethanol treatment.

This study aims to determine: 1) the trajectory in daily step counts before, during and after the lockdown in China, and 2) the characteristics associated with the trajectories. METHODS: From December 2019 to July 2020, smartphone-based step counts were continuously collected in 815 Chinese adults residing in Shanghai over 202 days across three phases: before, during, and after the lockdown. Participant characteristics were reported, and height, weight and body composition measured before the lockdown. A sharp regression discontinuity design with cluster robust standard errors was used to test the effect of the lockdown and reopening on daily steps and a linear mixed model was used to examine the characteristics associated with trajectories during the observed period. RESULTS: Based on 164,630 person-days of data, we found a sharp decline in daily step counts upon the lockdown (24/01/2020) by an average of 3796 (SE = 88) steps, followed by a significant trend of increase by 34 steps/day (SE = 2.5; p < .001) until the end of the lockdown (22/03/2020). This increasing trend continued into the reopening phase at a slower rate of 5 steps per day (SE = 2.3; p = 0.029). Those who were older, married, university educated, insufficiently active, had an at risk body composition, and those in the control group, were slower at recovering step counts during the lockdown, and those who were older, married, without university education and with an at risk body composition recovered step counts at a slower pace after the reopening.

The COVID-19 vaccine trials are high profile trials that have enrolled more than 100a?000 participants. Consent documents must be succinct and understandable to ensure informed voluntary participation. Objective: To assess how well informed consent documents of the COVID-19 vaccine trials achieve the ideal of being succinct and understandable, and to create a shorter, more readable document. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study collected and analyzed the informed consent documents used in 4 COVID-19 vaccine phase III randomized clinical trials to quantitatively assess readability and length and, based on this analysis, created a measurably more accessible informed consent document. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were number of words (measured as word count), time-to-read (measured at reading speeds of 175-300 words per minute), language complexity (measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment), and readability (measured using Flesch Reading Ease Score). Secondary outcomes included clarity of how the placebo group could access the vaccine if it is proven safe and effective. The study also examined the length and readability of an improved consent document. Results: The 4 informed consent documents were a mean (range) of 8333 (7821 to 9340) words long, with a mean (range) 35 (32.6 to 38.9) minutes to read at 240 words per minute. All documents exceeded grade 9 language complexity and scored lower than 60 in the formal reading ease metric, which constitutes difficult. Only 1 document specified that participants in the placebo group might receive vaccine.

RESULTS: Fifty-eight deceased donors were proposed during period A, 95 were proposed during period B, and 128 were proposed during period C. After the evaluation process, 32 of 58 (55.2%), 60 of 95 (63.2%), and 79 of 128 (61.7%) donors were used for organ donation in periods A, B, and C, respectively (P value = .595). We observed a 47% donation reduction in period A compared to period B and a 60% reduction compared to period C. There was a reduction of 44% and 59% in transplantation comparing period A with period B and period C, respectively.

To test the hypothesis that host factors, including age and sex, play a role in determining the effect of repeat vaccination and levels of pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza, we evaluated pre- and post-vaccination strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in adults over 75 years of age who received a high-dose influenza vaccine in at least four out of six influenza seasons (NCT02200276). Neither age, sex, body mass index, frailty, nor repeat vaccination were significantly associated with post-vaccination HAI titer outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers, however, were significantly predictive of post-vaccination outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers to H1N1 remained constant with age, while those to H3N2 and influenza B decreased substantially with age in males but not in females. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-existing immunity in this highly vaccinated older adult population and suggest that older males are particularly vulnerable to reduced pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza from previous annual vaccination.","output":"Sex-specific effects of aging on the humoral immune response to repeat vaccination with the high-dose seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with COVID-19 often complain of smell and taste disorders (STD).

However, the possible occurrence of other mechanisms leading to chemosensory dysfunction has also been hypothesized, and contrasting data have been reported regarding the direct infection of sensory neurons by SARS-CoV-2.

The study also assessed which eating behaviour traits predicted a reported increase of HED sweet and savoury foods and tested whether coping responses moderated this relationship. Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake. Consistent with previous findings, the current research suggests that low craving control is a risk factor for increased snack food intake during lockdown and may therefore represent a target for intervention.","output":"Susceptibility to increased high energy dense sweet and savoury food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown: The role of craving control and acceptance coping strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Vaccination is one of the most significant public health achievements of humanity.

They were randomized into four groups after the establishment of the ARDS model: non-SI-open group where no SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following open endotracheal suctioning; non-SI-closed group where no SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following closed endotracheal suctioning; SI-open group where SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following open endotracheal suctioning; and SI-closed group where SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following closed endotracheal suctioning. Oxygenation, indexes of respiratory mechanics, and hemodynamic indexes were serially measured during the procedure. The serum protein level, or the messenger RNA in the heart and lung, of inflammation-related cytokines was investigated. RESULTS SI in ARDS improved oxygenation, lung compliance, and airway resistance but had no significant effect in the hemodynamic indexes. At molecular level, SI in ARDS neutralized the increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor , interleukin 1 [IL-1], and IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the serum. Furthermore, SI in ARDS increased aquaporin 1 and aquaporin 5 messenger RNA in the lung tissue, and decreased IL-6 messenger RNA in the lung and heart tissue.

C57BL/6 mice were administered with NFA intratracheally, exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h to induce HALI, and kept at room air for 24 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung samples were collected after 24 h of post hyperoxia to analyze markers associated with HALI. Intratracheal (IT) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration of NFA notably attenuated hyperoxia-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar-capillary leakage, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF) into the BAL fluid, and resolution of inflammation in the lung. Western blot analyses showed that 10-nitrooleate reduced the expression of the inflammatory transcription factor NFB p65 subunit and increased antioxidant proteins HO-1 and NQO1 expression in the lung tissues compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, 10-nitrooleate reversed the hyperoxia-induced expression of mitophagy-associated markers (PINK1 and p62/SQSTM1), thereby protecting the HALI/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

We sought to determine the extent and the determinants of exercise limitation in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital discharge. Eighteen consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 1:1 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls underwent: spirometry, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography for the study of pulmonary circulation. Arterial blood was sampled at rest and during exercise in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 lie roughly on the same oxygen consumption isophlets than controls both at rest and during submaximal exercise, thanks to supernormal cardiac output (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was reduced by 30% in COVID-19 (P < 0.001), due to a peripheral extraction limit. In addition, within COVID-19 patients, hemoglobin content was associated with peak oxygen consumption (R(2) = 0.46, P = 0.002). Respiratory reserve was not exhausted (median [IRQ], 0.59 [0.15]) in spite of moderate reduction of forced vital capacity (79  40%). Pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise was not different between patients and controls. Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (39.5 [8.5] vs. 29.5 [8.8], P < 0.001), and such an increase was mainly explained by increased chemosensitivity. When recovering from COVID-19, patients present with reduced exercise capacity and augmented exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, including anemia and reduced oxygen extraction by peripheral muscles were the major determinants of deranged exercise physiology. Pulmonary vascular function seemed unaffected, despite restrictive lung changes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY At the time of hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 present with reduced functional capacity and exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, namely reduced oxygen extraction (myopathy) and anemia, which are not fully compensated by a supernormal cardiac output response, account for exercise limitation before exhaustion of the respiratory reserve. Enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity, rather increased dead space, mainly accounts for exercise hyperventilation. The pulmonary vascular response to exercise circulation of survived patients with COVID-19 does not present major pathological changes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on exercise pathophysiology: a combined cardiopulmonary and echocardiographic exercise study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Due to concerns of infection and medication disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, rheumatology patients at the pandemic epicenter were at risk of distress and poor health outcomes. We sought to investigate medication disruptions and COVID-19-related distress in the Bronx, New York shortly after the peak of the pandemic and determine whether factors related to the pandemic were associated with flares, disease activity, and overall health. METHODS: In the month following the epidemic peak, we surveyed adult patients and parents of pediatric patients from rheumatology clinics in the Bronx regarding medication access, medication interruptions, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19-related distress. We examined which factors were associated with patient-reported flares, disease activity, and overall health scores in regression models accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and rheumatologic disease type. RESULTS: Of the 1,692 patients and parents of pediatric patients that were contacted, 361 (21%) responded; 16% reported medication access difficulty, 14% reported medication interruptions, and 41% reported experiencing flare(s). In a multivariable logistic regression model, medication access difficulty was associated with increased odds of flare (odds ratio [OR] 4.0 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.5, 10.4]; P = 0.005), as was high COVID-19-related distress (OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2, 4.6]; P = 0.01). In multivariable linear regression models, medication access difficulty and high COVID-19-related distress were associated with worse disease activity scores, and high COVID-19-related distress was associated with worse health scores. CONCLUSION: Medication access difficulties and flares were common among rheumatology patients from the Bronx, New York in the month following the peak of the epidemic. Medication access difficulty and COVID-19-related distress were highly associated with flare and disease activity. COVID-19-related distress was associated with overall health scores.","output":"Association of Medication Access Difficulty and COVID-19-Related Distress With Disease Flares in Rheumatology Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Gut Cell Atlas (GCA), an initiative funded by the Helmsley Charitable Trust, seeks to create a reference platform to understand the human gut, with a specific focus on Crohn's disease.

In this study we aim to evaluate the early and midterm outcomes of MIS-C. METHODS: This is a longitudinal 6-month cohort study of all children admitted and treated for MIS-C from April 17 to June 20, 2020. Patients were followed a??2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months postadmission, with those with coronary aneurysms evaluated more frequently. RESULTS: Acutely, 31 (62%) patients required intensive care with vasoactive support, 26 (52%) had left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, 16 (32%) had LV diastolic dysfunction, 8 (16%) had coronary aneurysms (z score 2.5), and 4 (8%) had coronary dilation (z score <2.5). A total of 48 patients (96%) received immunomodulatory treatment. At 2 weeks, there was persistent mild LV systolic dysfunction in 1 patient, coronary aneurysms in 2, and dilated coronary artery in 1. By 8 weeks through 6 months, all patients returned to functional baseline with normal LV systolic function and resolution of coronary abnormalities. Cardiac MRI performed during recovery in select patients revealed no myocardial edema or fibrosis. Some patients demonstrated persistent diastolic dysfunction at 2 weeks (5, 11%), 8 weeks (4, 9%), and 6 months (1, 4%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with MIS-C treated with immunomodulators have favorable early outcomes with no mortality, normalization of LV systolic function, recovery of coronary abnormalities, and no inflammation or scarring on cardiac MRI. Persistence of diastolic dysfunction is of uncertain significance and indicates need for larger studies to improve understanding of MIS-C.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments. Complementation into functional Nluc was used to assess virus-cell entry. We discovered that each of the VLPs were effective at monitoring virus-cell entry, to various extents, in ways that depended on host cell susceptibility factors. Overall, we have developed and utilized a VLP system that has proven useful in identifying SARS-CoV2 assembly and entry features.","output":"Assembly and Entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2): Evaluation Using Virus-Like Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCanadians with disabilities make up nearly a quarter of the population yet face barriers in accessing information about COVID-19 testing accessibility across the country.

Here, we report a case of a patient with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with bone metastases and metastatic lesions that disappeared after molecular targeted therapy. PATIENT INFORMATION: A 49-year-old male patients chest CT scan showed a patchy, slightly high-density shadow on the upper lobe of the left lung with an unclear boundary. The multiple thoracic vertebrae, 4th lumbar vertebrae, multiple ribs, right sacroiliac joint, right hip joint, right inferior ramus of pubis, left middle and upper femur, and right proximal radial bone showed nodular and slightly high-density shadows. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was not considered eligible for tumor resection due to his metastatic lesions. A resected lymph node biopsy was performed. The pathologic findings suggested lung adenocarcinoma, and the gene detection results indicated NM-005228:exon19:c.2235C2249del:p. GLu746-Ala750del (15.31%), NM-005228:exon20:c. G2356A: p. V786M (1.67%). The patient received the icotinib hydrochloride molecular targeted therapy. OUTCOMES: After two months of treatment, pulmonary nodules were basically absent on chest CT scan re-examination. After nine months of treatment, no obvious abnormalities in the thoracic vertebral bone were found on 99mTc-MDP bone scan and CT scan re-examination. No obvious structural abnormalities, such as enlarged lymph nodes, could be found by ultrasound re-examination, and the patient remained alive without recurrence at the five-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case report may provide a clue for the future development of molecular targeted therapy for lung cancer. It will allow surgeons to collaborate with oncologists and raise awareness of the benefit of the multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Moreover, our results will help patients to fully understand the effect of nonsurgical treatments and improve confidence in the diagnosis and treatment of advanced lung cancer.","output":"Cancer Metastases from Lung Adenocarcinoma Disappeared After Molecular Targeted Therapy: A Successfully Clinical Treatment Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective vaccines should confer long-term protection against future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with unknown animal reservoirs. We conducted a cohort study examining multiple parameters of immune responses to SARS-CoV infection, aiming to identify the immune correlates of protection. We used a matrix of overlapping peptides spanning whole SARS-CoV proteome to determine T cell responses from 128 SARS convalescent samples by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Approximately 50% of convalescent SARS patients were positive for T cell responses, and 90% possessed strongly neutralizing Abs. Fifty-five novel T cell epitopes were identified, with spike protein dominating total T cell responses. CD8(+) T cell responses were more frequent and of a greater magnitude than CD4(+) T cell responses (p < 0.001). Polychromatic cytometry analysis indicated that the virus-specific T cells from the severe group tended to be a central memory phenotype (CD27(+)/CD45RO(+)) with a significantly higher frequency of polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2, and CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and CD107a (degranulation), as compared with the mild-moderate group. Strong T cell responses correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with higher neutralizing Ab. The serum cytokine profile during acute infection indicated a significant elevation of innate immune responses. Increased Th2 cytokines were observed in patients with fatal infection.

Several types of vaccines have been proposed and many of them have finally been approved and used in different countries. The different types of vaccines have different vaccine parameters, and therefore, this situation induces the necessity of modeling mathematically the scenario of multiple imperfect vaccines. In this paper, we introduce a SIR-based model considering different vaccines, and study the basic properties of the model, including the stability of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is less than 1. A sequence of further results aims to enumerate the conditions where the reproduction number can be decreased (or increased). Two important mathematical propositions indicate that in general vaccination might not be enough to contain an outbreak and that the addition of new vaccines could be counterproductive if the leakiness parameter is greater than a threshold {eta}.

We show that a single species, the quagga mussel, is now the primary regulator of P cycling in the lower four Great Lakes. By virtue of their enormous biomass, quagga mussels sequester large quantities of P in their tissues and dramatically intensify benthic P exchanges. Mass balance analysis reveals a previously unrecognized sensitivity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, where P availability is now regulated by the dynamics of mussel populations while the role of the external inputs of phosphorus is suppressed.

The parameters of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented.

Several growth factors and inflammatory stimuli are known to induce macropinocytosis, but its endogenous inhibitors have remained elusive. Stimulation of Roundabout receptors by Slit ligands inhibits directional migration of many cell types, including immune cells and cancer cells. We report that SLIT2 inhibits macropinocytosis in vitro and in vivo by inducing cytoskeletal changes in macrophages. In mice, SLIT2 attenuates the uptake of muramyl dipeptide, thereby preventing NOD2-dependent activation of NF-B and consequent secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokine, CXCL1. Conversely, blocking the action of endogenous SLIT2 enhances CXCL1 secretion. SLIT2 also inhibits macropinocytosis in RAS-transformed cancer cells, thereby decreasing their survival in nutrient-deficient conditions which resemble tumor microenvironment. Our results identify SLIT2 as a physiological inhibitor of macropinocytosis and challenge the conventional notion that signals that enhance macropinocytosis negatively regulate cell migration, and vice versa.","output":"SLIT2/ROBO1-signaling inhibits macropinocytosis by opposing cortical cytoskeletal remodeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is found to affect the mental health of the population. Undergraduate medical students are especially prone to mental health disorders and hence could be more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 217 undergraduate medical students in a medical college at Chennai, India. Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were recorded using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Items (DASS21) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in India in December 2019 and June 2020, respectively. In the follow-up survey, in addition to DASS21, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 related stressors were used. The self-administered questionnaire assessed the status of COVID-19 testing, interactions with COVID-19 patients, self-perceived levels of concerns and worries related to academics (COVID-19-AA (academic apprehensions)) and those pertaining to the self and family/friends (COVID-19-GA (general apprehensions)). Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of overall scores of depression, anxiety, and stress and scores stratified by gender, year of study, place of residence and monthly family income were performed. Predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 were investigated using adjusted binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The average scores of depression, anxiety, and stress during the baseline survey were 7.55  7.86, 4.6  6.19 and 7.31  7.34 with the prevalence (95% Cl) of 33.2% [27C39.9%], 21.2% [16C27.2%] and 20.7% [15.5C26.7%]; in follow-up survey, the mean scores were 8.16  8.9, 6.11  7.13 and 9.31  8.18 with the prevalence being 35.5% [29.1C42.2%], 33.2% [27C39.9%] and 24.9% [19.3C31.2%] for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress (P < 0.001), with depression remaining unchanged during COVID-19, irrespective of gender, year of study, place of residence and familys monthly income. Poor sleep quality, higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, higher COVID-19-GA, COVID-19 patients in family/friends and direct interactions with COVID-19 patients were found to be significant predictors of negative mental health in undergraduate medical students. COVID-19-AA was not significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to negatively affect the mental health of the undergraduate medical students with the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress being increased, and depression symptoms remaining unaltered. Addressing and mitigating the negative effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of this population is crucial.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health status of undergraduate medical students in a COVID-19 treating medical college: a prospective longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: At this time there are still major questions about the characteristics of disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in children as well as factors associated with the development of severe forms of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by realtime reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), and ferritin (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock.

It is expected that worldwide lockdown due to COVID-19 widespread cause reduction in environmental pollution in particularly the air pollution: however, such changes have been different in different places. In Chittagong, a city scale lockdown came in force on 26 March 2020, a week after when first three cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Bangladesh. This study aims to statistically evaluate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown (26 March to 26 April 2020) on selected air quality pollutants and air quality index s. The daily average concentrations of air pollutants PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO of Chittagong city during COVID-19 lockdown were statistically evaluated and were compared with dry season data averaging over previous 8 years (2012 to 2019). During lockdown, except NO2, all other pollutants studied showed statistically significant decreasing trend. During the COVID-19 shutdown notable reduction of 40%, 32% and 13% compared to the daily mean concentrations of these previous dry season were seen for PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, respectively. The improvement in air quality index value was found as 26% in comparison to the previous dry season due to less human activities in COVID-19 shutdown. The factor analysis showed that AQI in Chittagong city is largely influenced by PM10 and PM2.5 during COVID-19 shutdown.

It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic literature review (SRL) and meta-analysis was to analyse the influence of gender on COVID-19 mortality, severity, and disease outcomes. A SRL was performed in PubMed and Embase, searching terms corresponding to the 'PEO' format: population = adult patients affected with COVID-19; exposure = gender; outcome = any available clinical outcomes by gender, including mortality and disease severity. The search covered the period from January 1 to April 30, 2020. Exclusion criteria were: case reports/series, reviews, commentaries, languages other than English. Full-text, original articles were included. Data on study type, country, and patients' characteristics were extracted. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). From a total of 950 hits generated by the database search, 85 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected. RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare mortality, recovery rates, and disease severity in men compared with women. The male to female ratio for cases was 1:0.9. A significant association was found between male sex and mortality (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.25-2.62), as well as a lower chance of recovery in men (OR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.55-0.95). Male patients were more likely to present with a severe form of COVID-19 (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.10-1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Males are slightly more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, present with a more severe disease, and have a worse prognosis.

The lockdown in many countries is a serious threat for mental well-being, especially for individuals with severe mental illnesses. Discontinued outpatient treatments and a disruption of daily routines are considered to be a risk factor for destabilization of mentally ill patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of a group-chat program to replace cancelled face-to-face (f2f) group sessions in an outpatient psychiatric department. METHODS: Participants (n = 33) were recruited in the outpatient department of a large university medical center in Leipzig, Germany. Former f2f group participants were invited to take part in a therapist-guided group-chat for four weeks (eight sessions) and were asked to evaluate the program via self-administered standardized questionnaires at baseline (T0, pre-intervention), after every chat session (T1), and post-treatment (T2, after 4-6 weeks). The chat groups were specific to the following mental disorder diagnoses and based on the same therapeutic principles and techniques as the former f2f groups: anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sociodemographic measures, attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), treatment credibility/expectancy (CEQ), and participants' satisfaction (ZUF-8) were measured. RESULTS: Participants joined an average of 5.0 out of eight offered chat sessions. Participation rates in the respective groups were highest in the ADHD group (78.2%) and lowest in the anxiety group (41.1%). The overall pre-intervention level of depressive symptoms was moderate and showed a slight, non-significant improvement at post-treatment (T0: M = 10.7, SD = 5.5;T2: M = 10.2, SD = 5.5). A similar result was observed regarding quality of life (T0: Median = 41.7 - 68.8;T2: Median = 50.0 - 70.3). Treatment credibility and expectancy scores were medium high (T0: Mcredibility = 18.1, SD = 3.8;Mexpectancy = 11.2, SD = 5.1;T2: Mcredibility = 17.1, SD = 4.8;Mexpectancy = 10.3, SD = 5.8). Further, significant correlations were detected between post-treatment expectancy score and post-treatment PHQ-9 score (r = -0.41;p = .024), post-treatment physical quality of life (r = 0.54;p = .001) and post-treatment psychological quality of life (r = 0.53;p = .002). Overall, participants' satisfaction with the program was very high, both after chat sessions and at post-treatment (ZUF-8: M = 20.6, SD = 1.0). Of all participants, a majority (87.1%) rated the program as excellent/good and would recommend the group-chat program to a friend in need of similar help (83.9%).

Rapid identification of such variants is important for the public health decision making and to provide valuable data for epidemiological and policy decision making. We developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay that can specifically identify and differentiate between the emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SC-2 variants. In a single assay, we combined four reactionsone that detects SC-2 RNA independently of the strain, one that detects the D3L mutation, which is specific to variant B.1.1.7, one that detects the 242 to 244 deletion, which is specific to variant B.1.351, and the fourth reaction, which identifies the human RNAseP gene, serving as an endogenous control for RNA extraction integrity. We show that the strain-specific reactions target mutations that are strongly associated with the target variants and not with other major known variants. The assays specificity was tested against a panel of respiratory pathogens (n = 16), showing high specificity toward SC-2 RNA. The assays sensitivity was assessed using both in vitro transcribed RNA and clinical samples and was determined to be between 20 and 40 viral RNA copies per reaction. The assay performance was corroborated with Sanger and whole-genome sequencing, showing complete agreement with the sequencing results. The new assay is currently implemented in the routine diagnostic work at the Central Virology Laboratory, and may be used in other laboratories to facilitate the diagnosis of these major worldwide-circulating SC-2 variants.

Yet, contact rates and their relation to transmission and the impact of control measures, are seldom quantified. We quantify the response of contact rates, reported cases and transmission of COVID-19, to public health contact-restriction orders, and examine the associations among these three variables in the province of British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: We derived time series data for contact rates, daily cases and transmission of COVID-19 from a social contacts survey, reported case counts and by fitting a transmission model to reported cases, respectively. We used segmented regression to investigate impacts of public health orders; Pearson correlation to determine associations between contact rates and transmission; and vector autoregressive modeling to quantify lagged associations between contacts rates, daily cases, and transmission. RESULTS: Declines in contact rates and transmission occurred concurrently with the announcement of public health orders, whereas declines in cases showed a reporting delay of about 2 weeks. Contact rates were a significant driver of COVID-19 and explained roughly 19 and 20% of the variation in new cases and transmission, respectively. Interestingly, increases in COVID-19 transmission and cases were followed by reduced contact rates: overall, daily cases explained about 10% of the variation in subsequent contact rates. CONCLUSION: We showed that close-contact rates were a significant time-series driver of transmission and ultimately of reported cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada and that they varied in response to public health orders. Our results also suggest possible behavioral feedback, by which increased reported cases lead to reduced subsequent contact rates. Our findings help to explain and validate the commonly assumed, but rarely measured, response of close contact rates to public health guidelines and their impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases.","output":"Social Contacts and Transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the global need for reliable models of disease spread.

Since then the local public health offices have been responsible to monitor and react to the dynamics of the pandemic. One of their major tasks is to contain the spread of the virus after potential spreading events, for example when one or multiple participants have a positive test result after a group meeting (e.g. at school, at a sports event or at work). In this case, contacts of the infected person have to be traced and potentially are quarantined (at home) for a period of time. When all relevant contact persons obtain a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, the quarantine may be stopped. However, tracing and testing of all contacts is time-consuming, costly and (thus) not always feasible. This motivates our work, in which we present a statistical model for the probability that no transmission of Sars-CoV-2 occurred given an arbitrary number of test results at potentially different timepoints. Hereby, the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity of the conducted PCR test are taken in account.

OBJECTIVE: To determine public views regarding government and private conferral of immunity privileges. DESIGN AND SETTING: National on-line survey fielded in June 2020. Participants were randomly asked about either government passports or private certificates for COVID-19 immunity. PARTICIPANTS: Adults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to approximate national demographics. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Level of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences. RESULTS: Of 1315 respondents, 45.2% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p = 0.04). Support was greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from adjusted analyses showed less support among women (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Support was much higher among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (75.6% vs 24.4%) and much lower among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (22.9% vs 77.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Public views are divided on both government or private uses of immunity certificates, but, prior to any efforts to politicize the issues, these views did not vary along usual political lines or by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to infection. Social consensus on the desirability of an immunity privileges programs may be difficult to achieve.","output":"Public views about COVID-19 Immunity Passports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 exposed undergraduate medical education curricular gaps in exploring historical pandemics, how to critically consume scientific literature and square it with the lay press, and how to grapple with emerging ethical issues. In addition, as medical students were dismissed from clinical environments, their capacity to build community and promote professional identity formation was compromised. METHODS: A synchronous, online course entitled Life Cycle of a Pandemic was developed using a modified guided inquiry approach. Students met daily for 2 weeks in groups of 15 to 18 with a process facilitator. During the first week, students reported on lessons learned from past pandemics; in the second week, students discussed ethical concerns surrounding COVID-19 clinical trials, heard from physicians who provided patient care in the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics, and concluded with an opportunity for reflection. Following the course, students were asked to complete an anonymous, voluntary survey to assess their perceptions of the course. RESULTS: With a response rate of 69%, an overwhelming majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that learning about historical pandemics helped them understand COVID-19 (72, 99%). The course successfully helped students understand current and potential COVID-19 management strategies as 66 (90%) agreed or strongly agreed they developed a better understanding of nonpharmacological interventions and new pharmacological treatments. Students also gained insight into the experiences of healthcare providers who cared for patients with HIV and COVID-19. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended comments yielded 5 main themes: critical appraisal of resources, responsibility of the physician, humanism, knowledge related to pandemics, and learning from history. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of the COVID-19 crisis illustrated curricular gaps that could be remedied by introducing the history and biology of pandemics earlier in the curriculum. It was also apparent that learners need more practice in critically reviewing literature and comparing scientific literature with lay press. The flexible format of the course promotes the development of future iterations that could cover evolving topics related to COVID-19. The course could also be repurposed for a graduate or continuing medical education audience.","output":"Pandemics Past and Present: A Guided Inquiry Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Trichoblastoma is a rare skin neoplasm derived from the primitive hair follicle, having epithelial and mesenchymal components.

This work describes a case of tricoblastoma in a 4-year-old mixed breed dog, submitted to care at the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Western Bahia (HVU-UFOB). Case: A 4-year-old male mixed breed dog with 7 kg of body weight, was referred to the HVU-UFOB. The main complaint reported by the canines tutor was an increase in volume in the region of the animals face, which evolved slowly, associated with itching, bleeding and sensitivity to touch. During the physical examination, a round, elevated mass was observed in the subcutaneous tissue of the left face, in the mandible region, with local alopecia. On palpation, the neoformation showed a firm consistency, well-defined and fluctuating, with no solutions for continuity or discomfort to touch. The animals physiological parameters were within the normal for the species. CBC, chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasound and aspiration cytology of the mass were requested. The blood count and image tests did not reveal any changes. On cytological examination, small, grouped basal epithelial cells were observed, characterized by a high nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, monomorphic nuclei and intensely basophilic and pigmented cytoplasm, a suggestive diagnosis of basal cell tumor.

There is thus a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies to provide more broad and long-lasting protection. By using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we developed Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing Spike-1, Nucleocapsid and RdRp antigens and evaluated them following single-dose intramuscular or intranasal immunization in murine models. We show that respiratory mucosal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the three-arm immunity, consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells, and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that single-dose intranasal immunization provides robust protection against not only the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, but also two emerging VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that single-dose respiratory mucosal delivery of an Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy against current and future VOC.

We examined pathological manifestations in models of macrophage- or neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H1N1 strain PR8. Infected mice depleted of macrophages displayed excessive neutrophilic infiltration, alveolar damage, and increased viral load, later progressing into ARDS-like pathological signs with diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. In contrast, neutrophil-depleted animals showed mild pathology in lungs. The brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice exhibited elevated protein content, T1-, thrombomodulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and myeloperoxidase activities indicating augmented alveolar-capillary damage, compared to neutrophil-depleted animals. We provide evidence for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), entangled with alveoli in areas of tissue injury, suggesting their potential link with lung damage. When co-incubated with infected alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, neutrophils from infected lungs strongly induced NETs generation, and augmented endothelial damage. NETs induction was abrogated by anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, thus implying that NETs generation is induced by redox enzymes in influenza pneumonia.

A 2-radiographer mobile radiography team is required to perform bedside Chest X-rays (CXR) for these patients. Hospital guidelines require both radiographers to be in full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) throughout the image acquisition process and the mobile radiographic unit needs to be disinfected twice after each case. This affects the efficiency of the procedure and an increase usage of limited PPE resources. This study aims to explore the feasibility of performing mobile chest radiography with the mobile radiographic unit in a clean zone of the hospital ward. Methods An anthropomorphic body phantom was used during the test. With the mobile radiographic unit placed in a clean zone, the phantom and the mobile radiographic unit was segregated by the room door with a clear glass panel. The test was carried out with the room door open and closed. Integrated radiation level and patient dose were measured. A consultant radiologist was invited to review and score all the images acquired using a Barco Medical Grade workstation. The Absolute Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) scoring system was used to score these images. Results A VGA score of 4 was given to all the 40 test images, suggesting that there is no significant differences in the image quality of the images acquired using the 2 different methods. Radiation exposure received by the patient at the highest kV setting through the glass is comparable to the regular CXR on patient without glass panel at 90kV, suggesting that there is no significant increase in patient dose. Conclusion The result suggests that acquiring CXR with the X-ray beam attenuating through a glass panel is a safe and feasible way of performing CXR for COVID-19 patients in the newly converted COVID wards. This will allow the mobile radiographic unit as well as one radiographer to be completely segregated from the patient. Implications for practice This new method of acquiring CXR in an isolation facility set up requires a 2-Radiographer mobile radiography team, and is applicable only for patients who are generally well and not presented with any mobility issues. It is also important to note that a clear glass panel must be present in the barriers set up for segregation between the clean zone and patient zone in order to use this new method of acquiring CXR.","output":"Initial data from an experiment to implement a safe procedure to perform PA erect chest radiographs for COVID-19 patients with a mobile radiographic system in a clean zone of the hospital ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the strict personnel control measures in COVID-19 epidemic, the control system cannot be maintained and managed manually This puts forward higher requirements for the accuracy of its fault-tolerant performance The control system plays an increasingly important role in the rapid development of industrial production When the sensor in the system fails, the system will become unstable Therefore, it is necessary to accurately and quickly diagnose the faults of the system sensors and maintain the system in time This paper takes the control system as the object to carry out the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control research of its sensors A network model of wavelet neural network is proposed, and an improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the neural network model to avoid the deficiencies of traditional neural network algorithms For the depth sensor of a certain system, an online fault diagnosis scheme based on RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural network and genetic algorithm optimized neural network was designed The disturbance fault, 'stuck' fault, drift fault and oscillation fault of the depth sensor are simulated Simulation experiments show that both online fault diagnosis schemes can accurately identify sensor faults and the genetic algorithm optimized neural network is superior to RBF neural network in both recognition accuracy and training time under the influence of COVID-19 ? 2020 - IOS Press and the authors All rights reserved","output":"Research on fault tolerant control system based on optimized neural network algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Information about outcomes in Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS) patients is unavailable.

End points were mortality, stroke recurrence, functional outcome, and a composite cardiovascular end point comprising recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm rupture, systemic embolism, or sudden cardiac death. We performed Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate cumulative probabilities of outcomes by stroke type and Cox-regression to investigate whether stroke type was outcome predictor. RESULTS 2731 patients were followed-up for a mean of 30.524.1months. There were 73 (26.5%) deaths, 60 (21.8%) recurrences, and 78 (28.4%) composite cardiovascular end points in the 275 ESUS patients. The cumulative probability of survival in ESUS was 65.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 58.9%-72.2%), significantly higher compared with cardioembolic stroke (38.8%, 95% CI, 34.9%-42.7%). The cumulative probability of stroke recurrence in ESUS was 29.0% (95% CI, 22.3%-35.7%), similar to cardioembolic strokes (26.8%, 95% CI, 22.1%-31.5%), but significantly higher compared with all types of noncardioembolic stroke.

Therefore, it sounds reasonable to optimize the health care queuing systems to minimize the infection rate by prioritizing patients based on their health condition so patients with a higher risk of infection will leave the queue sooner. In this paper, relying on data mining models and experts opinions, we propose a method for patient classification and prioritizing. The optimal number of servers (treatment systems) will be determined by benefiting from a mixed-integer model and the grasshopper optimization algorithm.","output":"Prioritizing and queueing the emergency departments patients using a novel data-driven decision-making methodology, a real case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreads mainly through close contact of infected persons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and transmission remain unknown. Here, we propose a statistical physics model to coalesce all molecular entities into a cohesive network in which the roadmap of how each entity mediates the disease can be characterized. We argue that the process of how a transmitter transforms the virus into a recipient constitutes a triad unit that propagates COVID-19 along reticulate paths. Intrinsically, person-to-person transmissibility may be mediated by how genes interact transversely across transmitter, recipient, and viral genomes. We integrate quantitative genetic theory into hypergraph theory to code the main effects of the three genomes as nodes, pairwise cross-genome epistasis as edges, and high-order cross-genome epistasis as hyperedges in a series of mobile hypergraphs. Charting a genome-wide atlas of horizontally epistatic hypergraphs can facilitate the systematic characterization of the community genetic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 spread. This atlas can typically help design effective containment and mitigation strategies and screen and triage those more susceptible persons and those asymptomatic carriers who are incubation virus transmitters.","output":"The Genomic Physics of COVID-19 Pathogenesis and Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with chronic nephropathies were particularly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic These patients suffer from multiple comorbidities and some specific treatments may put them at risk towards severe complications Hemodialysis patients necessitating an in-center hemodialysis maintenance regimen were unable to be confined and despite strict prevention protocols suffered high infection and subsequently fatality rates Renal transplant patients, because of their immunosuppressive drugs, also represent an at-risk population of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2","output":"[Covid-19 pandemic in patients with chronic kidney disease]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O estudo que se apresenta, procura identificar eventuais correla??es entre o padr?o de distribui??o espacial da SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), no Brasil, ensaiando uma correla??o entre factores como o clima, as diferentes popula??es (Indgena, Quilombola e Parda) e a existncia de Aglomerados Subnormais, com o propsito de identificar contextos de desigualdade e injusti?a social.

What constitutes a contact is typically based on strict binary criteria (i.e., being at a location at the same time). Missing data, indirect contacts and background sources can however substantially alter contact-tracing investigations. Here, we present StEP, a Spatial-temporal Epidemiological Proximity model that accounts for imperfect data by introducing a network-based notion of contact based on spatial-temporal proximity derived from background flows of patient movement. Methods & Materials We showcase StEP by analysing outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria and COVID-19 within a large hospital Trust in London (UK).StEP utilises spatial-temporal patient trajectories and the background hospital movement flows to recover enhanced contact networks. Firstly, we study a well-characterised outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) involving 116 hospitalised patients where genetic sequencing is used to learn model parameters. Secondly, our trained model is deployed in an unsupervised manner on three unseen outbreaks involving 867 patients of related CPE-types. Thirdly, we test application to an altogether novel pathogen by analysing a hospital outbreak of COVID-19 among 90 hospital patients, and demonstrate the power of StEP when characterising newly emerging diseases, even when there is a lack of sequencing data. Results In addition to recovering core contact structures, StEP identifies missing contacts that link seemingly unconnected infection clusters, revealing a larger extent of transmission than conventional methods. Via genomic analyses we confirm that the additional contacts detected through StEP lead to improved alignment to the plasmid phylogeny (the major outbreak driving force). Hence the StEP contact network is most aligned to the transmission structure. Conclusion By considering spatial-temporal information in a continuous manner, StEP tackles several challenges associated with traditional contact-tracing. StEP allows both direct and indirect contacts as possible routes of disease transmission and is tuneable to a pathogen's epidemiological characteristics. Such flexible use of heterogeneous data in uncertain situations can significantly enhance IPC.","output":"Improved contact tracing using network analysis and spatial-temporal proximity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the differences and determinants of handwashing practices in India and identifies sections of the population with poor handwashing practices who are relatively more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have used the data from the recent National Sample Survey (NSS, 76th round) for India (2018). Bivariate and logistic regression analyses have been performed to predict the determinants of handwashing practices across states and socio-economic groups. Levels of education of the household head, Usual Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (UMPCE) of the household, access to water (other than drinking water) resources and sanitation facilities, and the availability of water with soap in and around latrine are major socio-economic and demographic factors that impact handwashing practices. Higher access to principal sources of water for drinking and other purposes, access to bathroom and latrine with soap, and the availability of water in or around latrine increase the likelihood of handwashing among the people. Universal handwashing across different sections of population will be effective to prevent further infection. The available data help us to identify the vulnerable sections of the population which are towards the lower end of the handwashing compliance spectrum.

The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to study how the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is linked to the government policies, and to analyse how different policies have produced different results on public health. METHODS: Considering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by their respective governments, we built an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case fatality rates. The model we implemented provides for the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (such as keeping the national borders closed or the increase in ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection. RESULTS: The 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for SARS-CoV-2, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual \\"second wave\\", while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is reflected also in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds also in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In line with what we expected, the obtained results show that the countries that have taken very restrictive measures in terms of limiting the mobility of the population have managed, more successfully than others, to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the model demonstrates that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries which have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.

This is in stark contrast with the pandemic-time situation. Many governments, at least initially, listened to the recommendations of expert advisers, most notably public health authorities, who proceeded from considerations of equality and common good.

Currently, this mutation, which is expressed on different SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide, has not been thoughtfully investigated. Therefore, we performed phylogenetic and biocomputational analysis to better understand SARS-CoV-2 Q675H mutants evolutionary relationships with other circulating lineages and Q675H function in its molecular context. Our studies reveal that Q675H spike mutation is the result of parallel evolution because it arose independently in separate evolutionary clades. In silico data show that the Q675H mutation gives rise to a hydrogen-bonds network in the spike polar region delimiting the conformational space of the highly flexible loop containing the furin cleavage site. This results in an optimized directionality of arginine residues involved in interaction of spike with the furin binding pocket, thus improving proteolytic exposure of the viral protein. Furin was found to have a greater affinity for Q675H than Q675 substrate conformations. As a consequence, Q675H mutation is likely to confer a fitness advantage to SARS-CoV-2 by promoting a more efficient viral entry. Interestingly, here we show an ongoing increase in the occurrence of Q675H spike mutation in the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). This finding highlights that, VOC are still evolving and start acquiring the Q675H mutation. At the same time, it suggests that our hypothesis of fitness advantage prompted by Q675H could be concrete.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis and in silico studies link spike Q675H mutation to SARS-CoV-2 adaptive evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurring outbreaks of COVID-19 have posed enduring effects on global society, which calls for a predictor of pandemic waves using various data with early availability. Existing prediction models that forecast the first outbreak wave using mobility data may not be applicable to the multiwave prediction, because the evidence in the USA and Japan has shown that mobility patterns across different waves exhibit varying relationships with fluctuations in infection cases. Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves. SAB-GNN combines GNN and LSTM to model the complex relationships among urban districts, inter-district mobility patterns, web search history, and future COVID-19 infections.

As part of a larger nationally representative survey experiment on the role of transparency on political trust, we collected data from 618 respondents in the Republic of Ireland in May 2020. The pre-registered study manipulated the level of the disclosure of government information about the status of the pandemic (high and low information conditions).

To meet this requirement, antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are essential. Methods: Between February 2020 and August 2020 we performed a cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19. The clinical performance of Ag rapid fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) and Ag Gold was evaluated and compared in parallel with genomic and subgenomic real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and cell culture-based assays. Results: In total, 150 samples were tested. Of these, 63 serial samples were obtained from 11 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 87 from negative controls. Serial respiratory samples were obtained 2 days prior to symptom onset (-2) up to 25 days post-symptom onset. Overall, for rRT-PCR-positive samples (n = 51), the detection sensitivity of Ag rapid FIA and Ag Gold was 74.5% and 53.49%, respectively, with a specificity of 100%; however, for samples with low cycle threshold (Ct) values, Ag rapid FIA and Ag Gold exhibited a sensitivity of 82.61% (Ct  30, 5.6 log(10)RNA copies/mL) and 80% (Ct  25, 6.9 log(10)RNA copies/mL), respectively. Despite low analytical sensitivity, both Ag-RDTs detected 100% infection in cell culture-positive samples (n = 15) and were highly effective in distinguishing viable samples from those with subgenomic RNA (66.66%). For both Ag-RDTs, all samples that yielded discordant results (rRT-PCR + ve/Ag-RDT -ve) were also negative by culture. Conclusion: The data suggest that Ag-RDTs reliably detect viable SARS-CoV-2; thus, they may serve as an important tool for rapid detection of potentially infectious individuals.","output":"Viable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolates Exhibit Higher Correlation With Rapid Antigen Assays Than Subgenomic RNA or Genomic RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Guidelines recommend long-term oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and 1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took 1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3  10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.","output":"Persistence With Dabigatran Therapy at 2 Years in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical regulatory role in the host response to the viral infection.

Most coronary artery fistulae are congenital, and the acquired variant is very rare. Herein, we present a possible acquired coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula, most likely secondary to bronchiectasis in the adjacent lung. We will analyze the hemodynamic significance of the fistula in this case and also seek to understand the outcomes of various treatment modalities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male patient presented with hypoxemia secondary to acute pulmonary edema during a hypertensive emergency. He developed myocardial ischemia after treatment with diuretics and nitroglycerin, due to shunting of blood from the right coronary artery to the right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery, via the fistula. This resulted in coronary steal syndrome. Coronary angiogram confirmed the fistula connecting the right coronary artery to the right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery. An attempt at coil embolization was unsuccessful due to the inability to advance the microcatheter beyond the fistula. DISCUSSION: The majority of coronary artery fistulae are asymptomatic as they are hemodynamically not significant and are incidentally detected by coronary angiography, CT angiogram, echocardiogram or multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) with 3D reconstruction. The development of congenital fistula can be explained by the Hackensellner involution-persistence hypothesis, but the anatomy in this case and the bronchiectasis in the part of the lung adjacent to the fistula makes an acquired cause very likely due to local inflammation and the age of patient at initial diagnosis. An initial diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made at age 51, which was 5 years prior to the detection of the coronary artery fistula in this patient. Symptoms have been described mostly in the elderly and include chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, and palpitations. Such symptomatic fistula should be treated either by percutaneous transluminal embolization or surgical ligation. CONCLUSION: This is a unique case of acquired coronary to pulmonary artery fistula in the setting of bronchiectasis in a patient in which PTE was attempted and failed. More research is required to understand the pathophysiology of acquired fistula. The decision regarding the method of closure should be individualized and decided on a case by case basis.","output":"Steal and strain: A case of coronary artery fistula presenting with coronary steal syndrome and underlying bronchiectasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of exposure to conflicting nutritional information (CNI) through different forms of media on nutrition-related confusion and backlash among consumers in the United Kingdom.

However, the anamnestic and clinical data of our CPP patients confirmed an acceleration in the stages of pubertal development. As expected, subjects with CPP showed a significantly greater stature SDS and height velocity SDS. There were no differences in BMI SDS and Delta BMI SDS. Interestingly, we discovered a significant difference regarding the use of electronic devices between children with CPP, IPT and controls (p < 0.05). Children with CPP showed significantly lower values of salivary melatonin than patients with TPT and controls (p < 0.0001).DiscussionOur results showed a marked reduction in salivary melatonin in children with CPP diagnosed during and after lockdown for COVID-19.

It is crucial to detect this disease as soon as possible to decrease its spread. The use of chest X-ray (CXR) images became an effective screening strategy, complementary to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often used for automatic image classification and they can be very useful in CXR diagnostics. In this paper, 21 different CNN architectures are tested and compared in the task of identifying COVID-19 in CXR images. They were applied to the COVIDx8B dataset, which is the largest and more diverse COVID-19 dataset available. Ensembles of CNNs were also employed and they showed better efficacy than individual instances. The best individual CNN instance results were achieved by DenseNet169, with an accuracy of 98.15% and an F1 score of 98.12%. These were further increased to 99.25% and 99.24%, respectively, through an ensemble with five instances of DenseNet169.

Additionally, being ED a clinical marker and predictor of non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular, subjects with ED could potentially have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID-19 and to measure the association of COVID-19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. A matching sample of COVID-19-negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID-positive; 75 COVID-negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027). Logistic regression models confirmed a significant effect of COVID-19 on the development of ED, independently of other variables affecting erectile function, such as psychological status, age, and BMI [OR 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50-24.01]. Likewise, subjects with ED were more likely to have COVID-19, once corrected for age and BMI [OR 5.27, 95% CI: 1.49-20.09]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On top of well-described pathophysiological mechanisms, there is preliminary evidence in a real-life population of ED as a risk factor of developing COVID-19 and possibly occurring as a consequence of COVID-19. Universal vaccination against the COVID-19 and the personal protective equipment could possibly have the added benefit of preventing sexual dysfunctions.","output":"\\"Mask up to keep it up\\": Preliminary evidence of the association between erectile dysfunction and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic, viral testing has largely focused on patients presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms. Although Centers for Disease Control has reported 1,551,095 cases in the United States as of May 21, 2020, asymptomatic infection rates remain unknown within the U.S., especially in geographically disparate regions. Methods: On April 7, 2020 our hospital established universal SARS-CoV-2 screening using RT-PCR RNA detection from nasopharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic patients prior to essential and elective surgeries. This study included 1,997 asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical procedures and 1,797 admitted for medical management at a Midwestern academic hospital between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020. Results: As of May 21, asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection had been completed for 1,997 surgical patients and 1,797 non-surgical patients. Initial testing was positive in 26 patients, with an additional four positive tests occurring during repeat testing when greater than 48 hours had elapsed since initial testing. Overall asymptomatic infection rate was 0.79%. Asymptomatic infection rate was significantly lower in surgical patients (0.35% vs. 1.28%, p=0.001). Surgical patients tended to be older than non-surgical patients, although this was not statistically significant (51, IQR 27-65 vsx 46, IQR 28-64, p=0.057). Orthopedic surgery patients were significantly younger than those from other surgical services (42 vs. 53 yrs, p<0.001), however orthopedic and non-orthopedic surgical patients had similar asymptomatic infection rates (0.70% vs. 0.25%, p=0.173). Conclusion: Among asymptomatic patients tested at a Midwestern academic medical center, 0.79% were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings will help guide screening protocols at medical centers while providing essential and elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the asymptomatic infection rate was low, this data substantiates the threat of asymptomatic infections and potential for community viral spread. These results may not be generalizable to large urban population centers or areas with high concentrations of COVID-19, each region must use available data to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of universal testing vs universal contact precautions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of potassium channel gene KCNQ5 and the changes of K(+) microenvironment within the retina of form deprivation myopia (FDM) guinea pigs. A total of 60 guinea pigs were randomly divided into the normal control (NC) group, the self-control (SC) group, and the form-deprivation (FD) group for different treatments. Molecular assays and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were conducted to measure the expression and distribution of KCNQ5-related gene and protein in the retina. We determined the K(+) concentration in the retina. In addition, the possible effects of form deprivation on potassium ionic currents and the pharmacological sensitivity of KCNQ5 activator Retigabine and inhibitor XE991 to the M-current in RPE cells were investigated using the patch-clamp technique. As a result, FD eyes exhibited more myopic refraction and longer AL. The mRNA and protein levels of KCNQ5 significantly decreased in the FD eyes, but the K(+) concentration increased. In addition, the M-type K(+) current [IK((M))] density decreased in FD RPE cells, and were activated or inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner due to the addition of Retigabine or XE991. Overall, KCNQ5 was significantly downregulated in the retina of FD guinea pigs, which may be associated with the increasing K(+) concentration, decreasing IK((M)) density, and elongating ocular axis.

We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response. MethodsWe conducted a prospective mixed-methods study, consisting of a questionnaire survey (n=195), a simulated client survey (n=103), and in-depth interviews (n=18). Data collection started approximately seven months after the pandemic reached Kenya. Quantitative data were summarized using measures of central tendency and multivariable modelling done using logistic regression. Qualitative analysis followed a thematic approach. ResultsThe initial weeks of the pandemic were characterized by fear and panic among service providers and a surge in client flow. Subsequently, 61% of pharmacies experienced a dip in demand to below pre-pandemic levels and 31% reported challenges with unavailability, high price, and poor-quality of products. Almost all pharmacies were actively providing preventive materials and therapies; educating clients on prevention measures; counselling anxious clients; and handling and referring suspect cases. Fifty-nine pharmacies (55% [95% CI 45-65%]) reported ever receiving a client asking for COVID-19 testing and a similar proportion supported pharmacy-based testing. For treatment, most pharmacies (71%) recommended alternative therapies and nutritional supplements such as vitamin C; only 27% recommended conventional therapies such as antibiotics. While 48% had at least one staff member trained on COVID-19, a general feeling of disconnection from the national program prevailed. ConclusionsPrivate pharmacies in Kenya were actively contributing to the COVID-19 response, but more deliberate engagement, support and linkages are required. Notably, there is an urgent need to develop guidelines for pharmacy-based COVID-19 testing, a service that is clearly needed and which could greatly increase test coverage.

However, less attention has been devoted to understanding the limits of NPIs across the course of the pandemic and along a continuum of their stringency. In this study, we explore the relationship between the growth of SARS-CoV-2 cases and an NPI stringency index across Canada prior to accelerated vaccine roll-out. Methods We conducted an ecological time-series study of daily SARS-CoV-2 case growth in Canada from February 2020 to February 2021. Our outcome was a back-projected version of the daily growth ratio in a stringency period (i.e., a 10-point range of the stringency index) relative to the last day of the previous period. We examined the trends in case growth using a linear mixed effects model accounting for stringency period, province, and mobility in public domains. Results Case growth declined, rapidly, by 20C60% and began plateauing within the first two weeks of the first wave, irrespective of the starting values of the stringency index. When changes in stringency periods occurred, any decrease in case growth was not immediate and was faster in the first wave (by day nine) than in the second (by day 16). In the first wave, the largest decreasing trends from our mixed effects model occurred in both early and late stringency periods depending on the province, at a geometric mean index value of 30?1 out of 100. When compared to the first wave, the stringency periods in the second wave possessed little association with case growth. Conclusions The minimal association in the first wave, and the lack thereof in the second, is compatible with the hypothesis that NPIs do not, per se, lead to a decline in case growth. Instead, the correlations we observed might be better explained by a combination of underlying behaviours of the populations in each province and the natural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. While there exist alternative explanations for the equivocal relationship between NPIs and case growth, the onus of providing evidence shifts to demonstrating how NPIs can consistently have flat association despite incrementally high stringency.","output":"Stringency of Containment and Closures on the Growth of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada prior to Accelerated Vaccine Roll-Out"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate a free terminal time optimal control applied to 6 ordinary differential equations which describe the spread of COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: We used the OncoSim breast and colorectal cancers microsimulation models to explore scenarios of primary screening stops for 3, 6, and 12 months followed by 6C24-month transition periods of reduced screening volumes. For breast cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, additional advanced-stage cases diagnosed, and excess cancer deaths in 2020C2029. For colorectal cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, undiagnosed advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in 2020, and lifetime excess cancer incidence and deaths. RESULTS: Our simulations projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, a three-month interruption could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and cancer deaths (110 more) in 2020C2029. A six-month interruption could lead to 670 extra advanced cancers and 250 additional cancer deaths. For colorectal cancers, a six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths.

RESULTS: In our study, we showed that the high-affinity variant of the FcRIIIa receptor, 158-V/V, is significantly over-represented in hospitalized and deceased patients with COVID-19, whereas the low-affinity FcRIIIa-158-F/F variant occurs more frequently in patients with mild COVID-19 (P < .0001). Furthermore, functional SARS-CoV-2 antibody-specific NK cell-mediated ADCC assays revealed that significantly higher proinflammatory ADCC responses occur in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and are especially observed in NK cells expressing the FcRIIIa-158-V/V variant (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that pronounced SARS-CoV-2-specific NK cell-mediated ADCC responses are influenced by NK cell FcRIIIa genetic variants and are a hallmark of severe COVID-19.","output":"High-affinity FcRIIIa genetic variants and potent NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses contributing to severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic and international health emergency by the World Health Organization. Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36; 95% CI: 1.63-33.14, p = 0.021). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of death related to COVID-19 and is triggered by a cytokine storm that damages the respiratory epithelium. Interleukins that cause the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity, such as interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, and, in particular, IL-17A and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), also play very important roles in lung damage in ARDS. Therefore, obesity is associated with an immune state favourable to a cytokine storm. Our hypothesis is that serum concentrations of TNF-&#945; and IL-17A are more elevated in patients with obesity and COVID-19, and consequently, they have a greater probability of developing ARDS and death.

Treatments by pharmacological interventions have been reported to impart negative implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Therefore, the use of psychotherapeutic interventions to bypass these side-effects and manage depression, anxiety has received a lot of attention. A meta-statistical consensus regarding the intervention is available, but with several limitations. In this study, we attempt to address these limitations and provide the current state of evidence evaluating the influence of psychotherapy on antenatal depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effects of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life during the antenatal stage of pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic identification of literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines on four academic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. A meta-analysis evaluated the influence of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life as compared to conventional obstetric care. RESULTS: Out of 1146 records, 22 articles including 2146 pregnant women (mean age: 28.6a??a??2.8 years) were included in this review. This systematic review presents a 1b level of evidence supporting the use of psychotherapy for reducing depression, anxiety and enhancing maternal quality of life.

However, its impact on mortality remained to be assessed. Using a collaborative pooled analysis, we examined whether early mortality after successful endovascular treatment is time dependent. METHODS AND RESULTS In a collaborative pooled analysis of 7 endovascular databases, we assessed the impact of onset-to-reperfusion time in large-artery occlusion (internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery) on outcomes. Successful reperfusion was defined as complete or partial restoration of blood flow within 8 hours from symptom onset. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2), 90-day excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-1), and occurrence of any intracerebral hemorrhage within 24 to 36 hours after treatment. A total of 480 cases with successful reperfusion (median time, 285 minutes) contributed to the present pooled analysis (120 with internal carotid artery occlusion and 360 with isolated middle cerebral artery occlusion). Increasing onset-to-reperfusion time was associated with an increased rate of mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage and with a decreased rate of favorable and excellent outcomes, without heterogeneity across studies. The adjusted odds ratio for each 30-minute time increase was 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.34; P<0.001) for mortality, 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.87) for favorable outcome, 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.86) for excellent outcome, and 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.33) for intracerebral hemorrhage.

At Chelsea and Westminster prior to COVID-19, our ambulatory hyperemesis patients were treated through the gynaecology inpatient ward. An average of 70 patients a year were seen on this pathway with a minimum of three visits per patient. Due to COVID-19 we needed to adapt this Service to the stricter challenges of infection prevention through collaboration with our local Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC). Method Our aim was to develop a Service to treat hyperemesis patients in a safe setting, while reducing patient footfall through our emergency department (ED) and maintaining gold-standard care. Results In partnership with AEC and ED, Gynaecology developed a new ambulatory hyperemesis pathway. The pathway centres around direct triage from ED;direct referrals from GPs and patients to AEC with gold standard care in the AEC setting. It has a clear focus on early initiation of treatment by AEC, improved patient experience but maintaining continuity and overall clinical leadership by gynaecology.

Since their introduction in 2011, they have become increasingly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis has driven institutions to examine such innovative solutions to manage patient care. The current controversies include quantifying safety outcomes, such as potential delayed or missed injuries, inadequate treatment, and medicolegal claims. Questions also exist regarding the potential for cost reductions and efficiencies that may be achieved. Physical distancing has limited the number of face-to-face consultations, so this review was conducted to determine if virtual fracture clinics can provide an acceptable alternative in these challenging times. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES The aim of this systematic review was to describe (1) adverse outcomes, (2) cost reductions, and (3) efficiencies associated with the virtual fracture clinic model. METHODS A systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted from database inception to March 2020. The keywords \\"virtual\\" or \\"telemedicine\\" or \\"telehealth\\" or \\"remote\\" or \\"electronic\\" AND \\"fracture\\" or \\"trauma\\" or \\"triage\\" AND \\"clinic\\" or \\"consultation\\" were entered, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria included adults and children treated for injuries by a virtual clinic model at the initial review. Eligible injuries included injuries deemed to not need surgical intervention, and those able to be treated remotely using defined protocols. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients reviewed by telemedicine using video links or in person at the initial review. Initially, 1065 articles were identified, with 665 excluded as they did not relate to virtual fracture clinics. In all, 400 articles were screened for eligibility, and 27 full-text reviews were conducted on 18 studies (30,512 virtual fracture clinic encounters). Three subdomains focusing on adverse outcomes, cost reductions, and efficiencies were recorded. The term adverse outcomes was used to describe any complications, further surgeries, re-referrals back to the clinic, or deviations from the protocols. Efficiency described the number of patients reviewed and discharged using the model, savings in clinic slots, reduced waiting times, or a reduction in consumption of resources such as radiographs. All studies were observational and the quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool, which demonstrated a median score of 6  1.8, indicating moderate quality. RESULTS Six studies reported adverse outcomes in detail, with events ranging from inappropriate splinting, deviations from protocols, and one patient underwent an osteotomy for a malunion. Efficiency varied from direct discharge proportions of 18% in early studies to 100% once the virtual fracture clinic model was more established. Cost reductions compared with estimates derived from conventional fracture clinics varied from USD 53 to USD 297 and USD 39,125 to USD 305876 compared with traditional fracture clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS Virtual fracture clinics may provide a means to treat patients remotely, using agreed-upon protocols. They have an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to the possibility to provide ongoing care in an otherwise challenging setting. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long-term effects on patients, institutions, and health care systems.

Three months later, MRI showed extensive abnormal signal intensities in the right occipitoparietal and left temporal lobes. Tacrolimus was useful in preventing recurrence. Because the seizures were intractable, a corpus callosotomy was performed at 16 years along with a concurrent brain biopsy from the bilateral lateral frontal cortices. We detected dysmorphic neurons in addition to inflammatory changes suspicious for RS, leading to a diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type a ?a and suspected bilateral RS.

Pediatric dentists play an important role in the healthcare system by managing dental emergencies in children while taking special measures to practice universal infection control in this COVID-19 pandemic. However, data are limited pertaining to the prevalence, etiology, and treatment provided to children at pediatric dental emergency services during the COVID-19 lockdown period. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period on Pediatric Dental Emergency Services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using data of patients aged 0C14 years who visited the Pediatric Dental Emergency Services, during the COVID-19 lockdown period from March 23, 2020, to August 31, 2020. Information regarding age, gender, time of presentation, chief complaint, and treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: This study revealed that dental emergencies in the pediatric dental services were predominantly related to dental pain (54.49%) followed by an abscess (12.35%), traumatic dental injuries (8.42%), and swelling (8.42%). A 5-year-old was the most prevalent age-group who reported dental emergencies. CONCLUSION: Dental pain was the most common chief complaint of patients reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recent state of affairs obligates the need to strike a balance between the safety of the healthcare professionals and providing optimum dental care to the patients requiring emergency intervention. While dental emergencies are unforeseeable, increasing community awareness about proper at-home care routines and utilizing regular dental preventive measures can potentially reduce the number of emergency visits.

This in part reflects the viral ability to influence the cytokine secretion and thereby the innate immune system. Especially the viral interference of IFN-I signaling and the subsequent deficiency of innate immune response in the early phase have been associated with rapid virus replication and later excessive immune responses. We propose a mathematical framework to analyze IFN-I signaling and its impact on the interaction motif between virus, NK cells and macrophages. The model recapture divergent dynamics of coronavirus infections including the possibility for elevated secretion of IL-6 and IFN- as a consequence of exacerbated macrophage activation. Dysfunction of NK cells recruitment increase disease severity by leading to a higher viral load peak, the possibility for excessive macrophage activation, and an elevated risk of the cytokine storm. Thus the model predicts that delayed IFN-I signaling could lead to pathogenicity in the latter stage of an infection. Reversely, in case of strong NK recruitment from infected cells we predict a possible chronic disease state with moderate and potentially oscillating virus/cytokine levels.","output":"The timing of natural killer cell response in coronavirus infection: a concise model perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ongoing surveillance of the means of suicide is necessary for effective prevention.

We used joinpoint regression analysis to examine changes over time in the suicide mortality rate for the 3 most common means of suicide. RESULTS: The age-standardized suicide mortality rate declined in earlier decades for both sexes, but did not significantly change in recent decades for either sex. The age-standardized rate of suicide by suffocation increased from 1993 for females (2.1% per year) and from 1996 for males (0.4% per year). The age-standardized rate of suicide by poisoning decreased for females (2.2% per year) and males (2.1% per year) from 1981 to 2018. The age-standardized rate of suicide by firearm decreased from 1981 to 2008 (7.4% per year) but did not significantly change there-after for females; for males, it decreased 2.1% per year from 1981 to 1993 and 5.7% per year from 1993 to 2007, but did not significantly change thereafter. INTERPRETATION: For both sexes, the rate of suicide by poisoning is decreasing, the rate of suicide by suffocation is increasing, and the rate of suicide by firearm has not significantly changed in the last decade.

However, the precise mechanism of action and the spatio-temporal pattern of BMP-signaling during these processes remains inadequately described. To address this, we have utilized a transgenic line harboring a BMP-responsive eGFP-reporter allele (BRE-eGFP) to construct the first detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation during lung development, homeostasis and adult-lung injury repair. We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury.","output":"Activation of the Canonical Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Pathway during Lung Morphogenesis and Adult Lung Tissue Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this opinion piece, we argue the current pandemic is shining a light on caregiving as critical work that is under\\\\valued and under\\\\paid.

As most research in this field has focused on negative effects of a loss, little is known about potential positive effects experienced by bereaved university students. This study investigated the experience of grief and personal growth in a sample of students from The University of Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Semi-structured interviews via Zoom/telephone with bereaved students (n = 14), who were invited to reflect on their loss and any personal growth potentially experienced. Thematic analysis of the data was based on a deductive and inductive approach. Results: The analysis identified four themes: (i) sharing of grief as a coping mechanism, (ii) balance between grief reactions and moving forward in life, (iii) lessons learned and personal growth, and (iv) adopting values from the deceased person and continuing bonds. Conclusions: Participants emphasized personal growth regarding self-perception and philosophical views on life. Following the loss, they preferred peer support, and used formal services only when they had a specific need. The findings indicate the importance of social support for bereaved students, and the complimentary role of peer and professional support.

OBJECTIVES: To report clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and mortality risk factors among COVID-19 patients admitted to a secondary hospital in Oman. METHODS: A retrospective study for the first 455 patients admitted with COVID-19 to Rustaq hospital from 12th April, 2020 to 27th September, 2020. A predesigned questionnaire collected data from the hospital medical electronic system. RESULTS: The mean age was 42.84 (SD = 19.86) years, and the majority of patients were aged 30 to 59 and 60 or above; 207 (45.5%) and 189 (41.5%), respectively. Male patients constituted approximately two-thirds of the subjects. Fever, dyspnea and cough were the most common presenting symptoms (69%, 66%, and 62%, respectively), while comorbidities with diabetes mellitus and hypertension were 47% and 44%, respectively. Bacterial growth was identified at approximately 10%. Bivariate analysis turned out to be significant with a number of factors. However, multivariate analysis showed significance with patients aged over 60 (OR = 7.15, 95% CI 1.99C25.63), dyspnea (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.5C5.33), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.02C3.66) and being bed-ridden (OR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.73C14.44). Durations from onset of symptoms to admission and respiratory distress were lower among patients who died; p = 0.024 and p = 0.001, respectively.

We sought to determine if the chance of successful reperfusion differs among hospitals, and if hospital site is an independent predictor of reperfusion. METHODS Nine hospitals recruited patients in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2), a prospective cohort study of endovascular stroke treatment conducted between 2008 and 2011. Patients were included for analysis if they had a baseline Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 0 or 1. Successful reperfusion was defined as a TICI reperfusion score of 2b or 3 at completion of the procedure. Collaterals were assessed using the Collateral Flow Grading System and were dichotomized as poor (0-2) or good (3-4). The association between hospital site and successful reperfusion was first assessed in an unadjusted analysis and subsequently in a multivariate analysis that adjusted for predictors of successful reperfusion. RESULTS 36 of 89 patients (40%) achieved successful reperfusion. The rate of reperfusion varied from 0% to 77% among hospitals in the univariate analysis ((2) p<0.001) but hospital site did not remain as an independent predictor of reperfusion in multivariate analysis (p=0.81) after adjustment for the presence of good collaterals (p<0.01) and use of the Merci retriever (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Reperfusion rates vary among hospitals, which may be related to differences in treatment protocols and patient characteristics. Additional studies are needed to identify all of the factors that underlie this variability as this could lead to strategies that reduce interhospital variability in reperfusion rates and improve clinical outcomes.","output":"Interhospital variation in reperfusion rates following endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a global public health event.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment. KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531-56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850-85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001).

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a neurologic hyperperfusion disorder that mostly affects posterior portions of the brain. Various theories were proposed to explain whether hypomagnesemia is etiology or associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). A patient with kidney transplantation suffered from fatigue and reduced urine output due to chronic diarrhea induced by Clostridium difficile. Hypoparathyroidism in addition to persistent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia was observed and suggested magnesium depletion with normal serum levels. Thereafter, the status was complicated with delirium, seizures, and coma. Neurological status rapidly improved after adding intravenous magnesium sulfate to antiepileptic drugs. The second magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed vasogenic edema compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Therefore, magnesium depletion, with normal serum levels, was considered the most implicated etiology of the syndrome in this patient. Also, hypomagnesemia during the acute phase of the syndrome and excluding all other etiology support this theory. Our case highlights hypomagnesemia-induced PRES, despite the normal serum level. Serum magnesium dropped during the acute phase of PRES, and magnesium should be maintained at the high normal limit, regardless of normal serum level.

Fake images are manipulated images altered through software or by other means to change the information they convey. Fake images propagated over microblogging platforms generate misrepresentation and stimulate polarization in the people. Detection of fake images shared over social platforms is extremely critical to mitigating its spread. Fake images are often associated with textual data. Hence, a multi-modal framework is employed utilizing visual and textual feature learning. However, few multi-modal frameworks are already proposed; they are further dependent on additional tasks to learn the correlation between modalities. In this paper, an efficient multi-modal approach is proposed, which detects fake images of microblogging platforms. No further additional subcomponents are required. The proposed framework utilizes explicit convolution neural network model EfficientNetB0 for images and sentence transformer for text analysis. The feature embedding from visual and text is passed through dense layers and later fused to predict fake images. To validate the effectiveness, the proposed model is tested upon a publicly available microblogging dataset, MediaEval (Twitter) and Weibo, where the accuracy prediction of 85.3% and 81.2% is observed, respectively.

Objective: We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a guns semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories economic stress, isolation, and home while others such as motion significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history;we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety ( = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.","output":"Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To quantify the atomization of liquid over the cornea during flap creation using microkeratome using high-speed shadowgraphy.

STATE OF THE ART Although according to tests performed in the lab, their filtration power is high, the filtering efficiency of these masks in real conditions of use, that is to say, during physical effort, is generally lower than that established in the laboratory and this information is rarely available on commercial products on sale. Clinical studies, which are rarely double-blind, demonstrate a lower incidence of symptoms and a somewhat better cardiac performance when exercise is performed while wearing a mask. For short-term use, the tolerance of these masks is fair. PERSPECTIVES There is room for technical improvements in mask design improved fitting to the face, lowering inspiratory resistance and dead space, as well as preventing the accumulation of humidity on the mask. Manufacturers should include information in their packaging on the filtering power and design masks usable by children. Clinical studies should be performed to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of mask in susceptible populations, especially people with asthma. CONCLUSION Anti-pollution filtering face piece respirators have a theoretical high filtering power towards particles, but their efficiency in real-life conditions is more limited. Because such devices may confer to users a false sense of protection, the French agency on environment and health do not support their use.","output":"[The use of anti-pollution masks in daily life - a review]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the association between cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) under the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) safety protocols in our hospital and the prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, in an urban area, where the prevalence of COVID-19 infection is relatively low. This was a single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study conducted at a tertiary critical care center in Kyoto City, Japan. Adult OHCA patients arriving at our hospital under CPR between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020 were included. Our hospital implemented a revised resuscitation protocol for OHCA patients on April 1, 2020 to prevent COVID-19 transmission. This study defined the conventional CPR period as January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, and the COVID-19 safety protocol period as April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Throughout the prehospital and in-hospital settings, resuscitation protocols about wearing personal protective equipment and airway management were revised in order to minimize the risk of infection; otherwise, the other resuscitation management had not been changed. The primary outcome was hospitalization survival. The secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation after hospital arrival and 1-month survival after OHCA occurrence. The adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for outcomes to compare the two study periods, and the multivariable logistic model was used to adjust for potential confounders. The study analyzed 443 patients, with a median age of 76 years (65-85), and included 261 men (58.9%). The percentage of hospitalization survivors during the entire research period was 16.9% (75/443 patients), with 18.7% (50/267) during the conventional CPR period and 14.2% (25/176) during the COVID-19 safety protocol period. The adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization survival during the COVID-19 safety protocol period was 0.61 (95% CI 0.32-1.18), as compared with conventional CPR. There were no cases of COVID-19 infection among the staff involved in the resuscitation in our hospital. There was no apparent difference in hospitalization survival between the OHCA patients resuscitated under the conventional CPR protocol compared with the current revised protocol for controlling COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Evaluation of a revised resuscitation protocol for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients due to COVID-19 safety protocols: a single-center retrospective study in Japan"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/26.md","filePath":"drive/26.md"}'),R={name:"drive/26.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
