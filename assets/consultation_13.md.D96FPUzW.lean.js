METHODS Between February 2011 and June 2012, 57 patients underwent LGGCP. Thirteen had it associated with a lap band and were excluded from the study. Data was collected through routine follow-up. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) were determined. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent LGGCP, 40 women and 4 men with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18-72), a mean body mass index of 38 kg/m(2) (range, 35-46). Comorbidities included 2 diabetes mellitus, 11 hypertension, 8 hyperlipidaemia, and 8 obstructive sleep apnea. The mean operative time was 106 min (range, 60-180) and mean duration of hospital stay was 18 h (range, 12-168). Operative complications included one subphrenic abscess, one gastrogastric hernia, and one acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty patients experienced strong restriction with nausea and vomiting for the first 10 days (79.5 %). Eleven patients (25.0 %) came back with intractable nausea and vomiting, and were hospitalized, or had their hospital stay prolonged. Four patients needed early reversal of gastric plication (9 %). There was no postoperative death. The mean postoperative % EWL was 30.6 % (n = 40), 57.0 % (n = 24), 50.7 % (n = 13) at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LGGCP yields an acceptable weight loss compared to other restrictive procedures, but with a higher readmission rate for postoperative nausea and vomiting, or even reversal of plication.

The impact of pre-intensive care ambient air pollutant exposure on the duration of artificial ventilation was, however, not yet established. METHODS: The medical records of 2003 patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Antwerp University Hospital (Flanders, Belgium), who were artificially ventilated on ICU admission or within 48 h after admission, for the duration of at least 48 h, were analyzed. For each patients home address, daily air pollutant exposure [particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  2.5 m (PM(2.5)) and  10 m (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and black carbon (BC)] up to 10 days prior to hospital admission was modeled using a high-resolution spatialCtemporal model. The association between duration of artificial ventilation and air pollution exposure during the last 10 days before ICU admission was assessed using distributed lag models with a negative binomial regression fit. RESULTS: Controlling for pre-specified confounders, an IQR increment in BC (1.2 g/m(3)) up to 10 days before admission was associated with an estimated cumulative increase of 12.4% in ventilation duration (95% CI 4.7C20.7). Significant associations were also observed for PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2), with cumulative estimates ranging from 7.8 to 8.0%.

Materials and Methods: The study of immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus was carried out in the frame of the large-scale program ruled by the state body responsible for the epidemiological surveillance. From the regional sample, medical workers (301 people) without a previous history of the new coronavirus infection at the time of biosampling (June 2020) were selected. The comparison group included 52 workers and was formed from engineering and technical personnel not employed in medical institutions. Within 150 days from the blood sampling, cases of the new coronavirus infection were monitored based on the patient's inclusion in the Federal Register of COVID-19 patients. To estimate the adjusted hazard ratios, Cox proportional hazards models was applied. Results and Conclusions: In 150-day follow-up it was revealed that the probability of remaining healthy by the end of the follow-up was the lowest among doctors from medical and preventive institutions (MPI) that did not serve as temporary hospitals: HR 2,33 [95% CI 0,95;5,70], which may be due to both insufficient anti-epidemic measures and the peculiarities of the immune response and approaches for its evaluation.

Rapid and accurate AMR diagnostic methods are thus very urgently needed. However, traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput, and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done. RESULTS In the current study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CTZ), and gentamicin (GEN). We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding, and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public data set. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic.

Based on literature review and clinical expertise, fluid volume management was selected as a potential modifiable risk factor to decrease IDH. Root causes identified as contributing to IDH were incorporated into a Paediatric haemodialysis fluid volume management (PedHDfluid) program using the Model for Improvement methodology including rapid cycles of change. METHODS: Multiple measures were evaluated including (i) Outcome: IDH events per number of HD sessions per week; (ii) Process: number of changes to estimated dry weight per number of HD sessions per week; (iii) Balancing: time spent on dry weight meeting per week. Data was analysed using statistical process control charts. We aimed to decrease IDH in our dialysis unit to < 10% of HD sessions per week over a 6-month period by implementing a PedHDfluid program, including a multifaceted dry weight assessment protocol, multidisciplinary meetings and electronic health records Dry Weight Evaluation flow sheet/synopsis.

A total of 73 questions were asked regarding demographics, COVID-19 observations, personal impact, effect on education, adoption of telemedicine, and anticipated challenges moving forward. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess factors related to likelihood of future conference attendance, future online education, and changes in surgical indications. Results: A total of 902 spine surgeons from seven global regions completed the survey. Respondents reported a mean level of overall concern of 3.7 on a scale of one to five. 84.0% reported a decrease in clinical duties, and 67.0% reported a loss in personal income.

Thus, in order to find potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new burden.

The research is mainly focused on assessing the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on the global shipping and especially container one that is contemporarily the most vital link of the global intermodal land-sea supply chains. The analyses take into account the adaptive measures taken by ship operators and other individual parties being an integral link of the global supply chains with an aim to mitigate the effects of radical slowdown in industrial and global trade activity. The research was based on the analyses, reports and several business information carried out by specialized international organizations as well as ship carriers and logistics providers. The obtained research results indicate the need to reconfigure global logistics supply chains and increase their resilience by introducing new digital solutions. It is high time to introduce new smart, green digital supply chains and subsequently to reconfigure them much more towards the regional trade and economic relations and ties among countries (reshoring). Such activities aiming at rebuilding the logistic supply chains may at the same time change the presently existing business environment in global maritime shipping, enforcing not only changes in ship owners business models but also serious structural alterations on the shipping freight markets. ? 2022, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome limitations of observational studies, e.g. unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. Objective: To elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Method: In November, 2020, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released on 20 Oct. 2020). Our study population consisted of almost 2 million participants with either a (neuro)psychiatric disorder or data on COVID-19 status. Outcomes and exposures were anxiety, anxiety-and-stress related disorders, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-bipolar disorder combined (BIP-SCZ), and Alzheimer dementia on the one hand; and self-reported, confirmed, hospitalized, and very severe COVID-19 on the other. Results: In single-variable MR analysis the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for BIP-SCZ (a combined anxiety of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls): the effect estimate was consistent with increased risk of COVID-19. Nominally significant univariable results were in line with slightly elevated risks of COVID-19 for genetic liabilities to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. No COVID-19 phenotype consistently increased risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR, bipolar disorder was the only phenotype showing a Bonferroni-corrected significant effect on a COVID-19 phenotype, namely severe COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. Conclusions: Genetic liability to bipolar disorder slightly increases COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The contribution of bipolar disorder to these COVID-19 phenotypes was smaller than the odds ratios estimated by observational studies. Strength of association and direction of effect for genetic liability to schizophrenia were similar, albeit less significant. We found no consistent evidence of reverse effects, i.e. of genetic liability to COVID-19 on psychiatric disorders.","output":"Are psychiatric disorders risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity?a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work focuses on a time series analysis and forecast of COVID 19.

This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.","output":"Parkinsonism as a Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and new vaccines are developed, concerns among the general public are growing that both infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and vaccinations against the coronavirus (mRNA vaccines) could lead to infertility or higher miscarriage rates. These fears are voiced particularly often by young adults of reproductive age. This review summarizes the current data on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and corona vaccinations on female and male fertility, based on both animal models and human data. Method A systematic literature search (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) was carried out using the search terms COVID 19, SARS-CoV-2, fertility, semen, sperm, oocyte, male fertility, female fertility, infertility. After the search, original articles published between October 2019 and October 2021 were selected and reviewed. Results Despite the use of very high vaccine doses in animal models, no negative impacts on fertility, the course of pregnancy, or fetal development were detected. In humans, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the oocytes/follicular fluid of infected women;similarly, no differences with regard to pregnancy rates or percentages of healthy children were found between persons who had recovered from the disease, vaccinated persons, and controls. Vaccination also had no impact on live-birth rates after assisted reproductive treatment. No viral RNA was detected in the semen of the majority of infected or still infectious men;however, a significant deterioration of semen parameters was found during semen analysis, especially after severe viral disease. None of the studies found that corona vaccines had any impact on male fertility. Discussion Neither the animal models nor the human data presented in recent studies provide any indications that fertility decreases after being vaccinated against coronavirus. However, there is a growing body of evidence that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has a negative impact on male fertility and there is clear evidence of an increased risk of complications among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The counseling offered to young adults should therefore take their fears and concerns seriously as well as providing a structured discussion of the current data.","output":"Corona and Reproduction, or Why the Corona Vaccination Does Not Result in Infertility ?Corona und Reproduktion oder warum die Coronaimpfung nicht unfruchtbar macht"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has been declared as a global emergency by the World Health Organization which has mounted global pressure on the healthcare system. The design and development of rapid tests for the precise and early detection of infection are urgently needed to detect the disease and also for bulk screening of infected persons. The traditional drugs moderately control the symptoms, but so far, no specific drug has been discovered. The prime concern is to device novel tools for rapid and precise diagnosis, drug delivery, and effective therapies for coronavirus. In this context, nanotechnology offers novel ways to fight against COVID-19. AREA COVERED: This review includes the use of nanomaterials for the control of COVID-19. The tools for diagnosis of coronavirus, nano-based vaccines, and nanoparticles as a drug delivery system for the treatment of virus infection have been discussed. The toxicity issues related to nanoparticles have also been addressed. EXPERT OPINION: The research on nanotechnology-based diagnosis, drug delivery, and antiviral therapies is at a preliminary stage. The antiviral nanomedicine therapies are cost-effective and with high quality. Nanoparticles are a promising tool for prevention, diagnosis, antiviral drug delivery, and therapeutics, which may open up new avenues in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Nanotechnology-based promising strategies for the management of COVID-19: current development and constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The local antiviral photodynamic therapy (PDI) proves to be a helpful kind of therapy reducing the viral load in the nose and throat area in the early phase of a Covid-19 infection. The reason is the relatively good accessibility of infected nasal and pharyngeal mucous membranes for certain dyes and corresponding light sources. One advantage of PDI is the fact, that no defense of viruses against this physical kind of therapy has been reported yet. Using PDI to attack and destroy viral envelopes and viral RNA, extra- and intracellular, shows no or neglectable adverse effects of healthy cells. We now know that both the infectivity and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the early phase depend on the viral load in this area. PDI reduction of the viral load can be a valuable contribution both to prophylaxis and therapy in the early phase of Covid-19 infections. It can also be a solution for the problem of a lack of sterile immunity after vaccination against Covid-19. But a rapid spread of the procedure appropriate to the development of the pandemic is considerably limited. One of the reasons for this is that all PDI processes in this area have so far used coherent laser radiation as excitation light source. This is not only expensive and technically complex; it also requires appropriate training for users and protective equipment for practitioners and patients. In addition, the allowable power density is limited in order to avoid thermal effects resulting in long exposure (irradiation) times. The aim of our study was to find out whether it would also be possible to use much simpler light sources, e.g. pocket flashlights to achieve significant intracellular SARS-CoV-2 reductions in combination with the organic dye methylene blue (MB) as a sensitizer. As a substitute for SARS-CoV-2 viruses we started with BCoV infected U373 cells. We used an 810nm diode laser with 300 mW/cm(2) power density - resulting in 100J/cm(2) light dose (irradiation time 5.46 min) as well as a 590 nm LED lamp and a broadband LED with irradiation intensity of 10,000 lx each (irradiation time 2,5 and 10 min) and concentrations of the sensitizer of 0.001% and 0.0001%. The 0.001% MB sensitizer experiments showed similar results with all kind of exposure sources without significant differences. The logarithmic reduction factor varied between  5.29 and  5.31 which corresponds to an inactivation of BCoV of 99.999%. With 0.0001% MB sensitizer concentration the results were similar varying between  4.6 and  5.31. Extending the exposure time from 2 to 5 and 10 minutes did not change these results. In contrast approaches of BCoV-infected cells in the dark, treated with 0.001% and 0.0001% MB sensitizer alone, a lot of residual virus could be detected after 10 minutes of incubation (RF 0.9 and RF 1.23 for 0.001% MB and 0.0001% MB respectively) In our SARS-CoV-2 experiments with Vero E6 infected cells irradiation time was reduced to 1, 2 and 3 minutes for both concentrations with increased radiation intensity from 20,000 to 50,000 and 100,000 lx. Here too, the extension of the irradiation time and increase of irradiation intensity with LED broadband flashlight did not have any effect on the virus reduction results. (RF 4.67 for 0.001% and 0.0001% respectively) In these SARS-CoV2 experiments we were able to show a minimum concentration of 0.0001%MB and a minimum radiation intensity of 20,000 lx lead to a 99.99% reduction of intracellular viruses after one minute exposure. Reducing of the beam intensity to.1500 lx and 2 minutes exposure led to a similar result. In contrast to our BCoV experiments we could also observe similar reduction quotes after 3 minutes in the dark.","output":"\\"Evaluation of methylene blue based photodynamic inactivation (PDI) against intracellular B-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses under different light sources in vitro as a basis for new local treatment strategies in the early phase of a Covid19 infection\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2013, in a bid to combat Vaccine Hesitancy (VH) and provide information on vaccines by communicating with the general public and the health community (e.g., healthcare workers and public health operators), the Italian Society of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine (S.It.I.) published the national website \\"VaccinarS\\".

Complexity had an influence on accuracy at post-treatment (F(1) = 4.8391, p = 0.0501) and at maintenance (F(1) = 5.3391, p = 0.04125). Practicing scripts with high complexity increased accuracy by 11.33% at post-treatment and by 9.90% at maintenance compared to scripts with low complexity. Participants with nonfluent aphasia made greater gains than those with fluent aphasia. There was no significant effect of feedback. CONCLUSION This study reinforces script training as a treatment option for aphasia. Results highlight the use of more complex scripts to better promote acquisition and maintenance of script production skills. There is a need for further investigation of these variables with larger samples and with other types of aphasia treatments.

However, whether SGLT2 inhibitors affect the tissue characteristics of the human arterial wall remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tofogliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, on the tissue characteristics of the human arterial wall in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without apparent cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS The present study was a post hoc analysis based on data obtained from the Using Tofogliflozin for Possible Better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for Type 2 Diabetes Patients (UTOPIA) trial, which was a multicenter prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tofogliflozin in preventing the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. We evaluated the longitudinal change in the ultrasonic tissue characteristics of the carotid wall using gray-scale median (GSM), an established index of ultrasonic tissue characteristics. The right and left intima-medial areas were delineated, and the GSM values were evaluated (right GSM-CCA and left GSM-CCA). The average values of the right and left carotid arteries were defined as \\"mean GSM-CCA value.\\" RESULTS In a mixed-effects model for repeated measures, mean GSM-CCA, along with the right and left GSM-CCA values, did not significantly change in either the tofogliflozin (n = 168) or conventional treatment group (n = 169). In addition, the tofogliflozin and conventional treatment groups did not significantly differ regarding the change of the mean GSM-CCA (mean difference [95% CI] - 1.24[- 3.87, 1.38], P = 0.35), along with the right (mean difference [95% CI] - 2.33[- 5.70, 1.05], P = 0.18) and the left GSM-CCA (mean difference [95% CI] - 0.29 [- 3.53, 2.95], P = 0.86) values. Similar findings were obtained even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and/or the administration of drugs at baseline. CONCLUSIONS The tissue characteristics of the carotid arterial wall did not change in either the tofogliflozin or conventional treatment group during the 104-week treatment period, and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups.

Visualizing such data in an interactive form is essential for public sharing and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi) framework has been used as an integrative model layered atop geospatial data, and its deployment within the dynamic ArcGIS universe would open up powerful new avenues for sophisticated, interactive GIS analysis. OBJECTIVE: We propose an actively developed suite of software, the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, for creating, viewing, sharing, and analyzing interactive ToxPi figures in ArcGIS. METHODS: The ToxPi*GIS Toolkit is a collection of methods for creating interactive feature layers that contain ToxPi diagrams. It currently includes an ArcGIS Toolbox (ToxPiToolbox.tbx) for drawing geographically located ToxPi diagrams onto a feature layer, a collection of modular Python scripts that create predesigned layer files containing ToxPi feature layers from the command line, and a collection of Python routines for useful data manipulation and preprocessing. We present workflows documenting ToxPi feature layer creation, sharing, and embedding for both novice and advanced users looking for additional customizability. RESULTS: Map visualizations created with the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit can be made freely available on public URLs, allowing users without ArcGIS Pro access or expertise to view and interact with them. Novice users with ArcGIS Pro access can create de novo custom maps, and advanced users can exploit additional customization options. The ArcGIS Toolbox provides a simple means for generating ToxPi feature layers. We illustrate its usage with current COVID-19 data to compare drivers of pandemic vulnerability in counties across the United States. SIGNIFICANCE: Development of new features, which will advance the interests of the scientific community in many fields, is ongoing for the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, which can be accessed from www.toxpi.org.","output":"ToxPi*GIS Toolkit: Creating, viewing, and sharing integrative visualizations for geospatial data using ArcGIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological safety is valued in other high-risk industries as an essential element to ensure safety.

Lapachol is a 1,4- naphthoquinone compound that has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects against several diseases. SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (nsps) play an important role in the viral replication cycle. Nsp9 seems to play a key role in transcription of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening by docking and molecular dynamics suggests that lapachol derivatives can interact with Nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2. Complexes of lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI with the Nsp9 RNA binding site were subjected to molecular dynamics assays, to assess the stability of the complexes via RMSD. All complexes were stable over the course of 100 ns dynamics assays. Analyses of the hydrogen bonds in the complexes showed that lapachol derivatives VI and IX demonstrated strongest binding, with a stable or increasing number of hydrogen bonds over time. Our results demonstrate that Nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2 could be an important target in prospecting for ligands with antiviral potential.

The used PCR systems were designed to detect sequences representing the group-specific virulence genes encoding fimbriae f5 (K99), Shiga toxins (stx(1) and stx(2)), heat-stable enterotoxins (st), heat-labile enterotoxins (lt), intimin (eae), hemolysin (hylA), and EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin (astA). In the present work, a total of 150 E. coli field isolates were recovered from 150 fecal swabs collected from 100 diarrheic and 50 apparently healthy in-contact cattle and buffalo calves under 3 months old. Out of these 150 isolated E. coli, 106 isolates from 77 diarrheic and 29 in-contact calves harbored one or more of the investigated virulence genes. The pathotyping of the isolates could classify them into shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) with a 30.7, 2.7, 12.7, and 7.3% distribution, respectively. Meanwhile, the detection rates of f5, stx(1), stx(2), st, lt, eae, hylA, and astA genes were 17.3, 27.3, 6.7, 10, 37.3, 17.7, 9.3, and 20.7%, respectively. These virulence genes were found either single or in different combinations, such as stx/eae, stx/st/f5, eae/st/f5, or st/lt/f5. Four attaching-effacing shigatoxigenic E. coli isolates (AE-STEC) harboring stx/eae were retrieved from diarrheic calves. Although none of the stx-or eae-positive isolates was verified as O157:H7, STEC isolates detected in apparently healthy calves have potential pathogenicity to humans highlighting their zoonotic importance as reservoirs. Atypical combinations of ETEC/STEC and ETEC/EPEC were also detected in percentages of 14.7 and 2.7%, respectively. Most of these atypical combinations were found more in buffalo calves than in cattle calves. While STEC and EPEC isolates were detected more in cattle calves than in buffalo calves, ETEC isolates were the same in the two species. The pathogenic E. coli infection in calves was recorded to be higher in the first weeks of life with the largest numbers of virulence factor-positive isolates detected at the age of 4 weeks. Histopathological examination of five intestinal samples collected from four dead buffalo calves revealed typical attaching and effacing (AE) lesion which was correlated with the presence of intimin encoding virulence gene (eae). Other lesions characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, shortening and fusion of intestinal villi and desquamation of the lining epithelium of intestinal mucosa had also been detected.","output":"Molecular characterization of pathogenic Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic and in-contact cattle and buffalo calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local and state public health officials, who before the pandemic mainly worked behind the scenes to protect the public's health, were quickly thrust into the spotlight alongside their governors, mayors, and county commissioners to explain public health mitigation efforts such as business and school closures, mandatory mask orders, and social distancing recommendations.

Diagnosing AD before symptoms arise will facilitate earlier intervention. The early diagnostic approaches are thus urgently needed. Methods: The multifunctional nanoparticles W20/XD4-SPIONs were constructed by the conjugation of oligomer-specific scFv antibody W20 and class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) activator XD4 onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The SPIONs' stability and uniformity in size were measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The ability of W20/XD4-SPIONs for recognizing A? oligomers (A?Os) and promoting A?Os phagocytosis was assessed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. The blood-brain barrier permeability of W20/XD4-SPIONs was determined by a co-culture transwell model. The in vivo probe distribution of W20/XD4-SPIONs in AD mouse brains was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: W20/XD4-SPIONs, as an A?Os-targeted molecular MRI contrast probe, readily reached pathological A?Os regions in brains and distinguished AD transgenic mice from WT controls. W20/XD4-SPIONs retained the property of XD4 for SR-A activation and significantly promoted microglial phagocytosis of A?Os. Moreover, W20/XD4-SPIONs exhibited the properties of good biocompatibility, high stability and low cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Compared with W20-SPIONs or XD4-SPIONs, W20/XD4-SPIONs show the highest efficiency for A?Os-targeting and significantly enhance A?Os uptake by microglia. As a molecular probe, W20/XD4-SPIONs also specifically and sensitively bind to A?Os in AD brains to provide an MRI signal, demonstrating that W20/XD4-SPIONs are promising diagnostic agents for early-stage AD. Due to the beneficial effect of W20 and XD4 on neuropathology, W20/XD4-SPIONs may also have therapeutic potential for AD .","output":"Multifunctional Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Conjugated with A?

Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside worldand will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","output":"Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employeesAn efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies indicated that small mammals are important reservoirs for Bartonella species.

Methods: The Persian version of the COVID-19-BS was prepared through forward translation, reconciliation, and back-translation. The method of the study was descriptive (psychometric). The statistical population included all students of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from October 2020 to November 2020. Using the convenience sampling method, 251 students were selected. All participants completed the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS), the Compassion Scale (CS), and the COVID19-BS. Convergent validity, divergent validity, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate the validity. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25 and LISREL 8.5 software. Results: The findings supported the single-factor structure of COVID-19-BS and a good internal consistency of the scale. Internal consistency obtained by Cronbach's alpha method for the total score of C-19ASS was 0.72, indicating a good internal consistency. The COVID-19-BS had a positive and significant correlation with the C-19ASS (P = 0.01, r = 0.37) and a negative and significant correlation with the CS (P = 0.01, r = -0.41), indicating the convergent and divergent validity of this scale (P<0.01).

METHODS This study was comparing 10 consecutive transumbilical LESS adrenalectomies and 10 conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomies performed between March 2006 and April 2010 for benign adrenal tumors. Perioperative parameters were compared, and we reviewed our surgical videos and analyzed technical characteristics of the surgeries. RESULTS There was no open conversion in laparoscopic group, no additional port placement in LESS group, and no perioperative complications in either group. No significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, or resumption of oral intake were observed between two groups. Pneumoperitoneum time did not differ between LESS and laparoscopic groups (91.2 vs. 74.3 min, P = 0.257). In LESS group only, time was needed for adjustment of roticulator (14.5  8.1 min). After subtracting the time needed for adjustment, operative time between two groups was more comparable (76.7 vs. 74.3 min, P = 0.880). One-handed manipulation time in LESS group decreased in a time-dependent manner (r = -0.806, P < 0.0049).

With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space.","output":"Predicting the current and future distribution of the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus, across the Western US using citizen science collections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The amount of information available about millions of different subjects is growing every day.

Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO?) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. METHODS We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. RESULTS The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. DISCUSSION Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO.

Sodium intake is indispensable for normal body function but can be detrimental when it exceeds dietary requirements.

An integral and one of the most difficult part of scaling digital learning and teaching is to be able to assess learner's knowledge and competency. An educator can record a lecture or create digital content that can be delivered to thousands of learners but assessing learners is extremely time consuming. In the paper, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solution namely VidVersityQG for generating questions automatically from pre-recorded video lectures. The solution can automatically generate different types of assessment questions (including short answer, multiple choice, true/false and fill in the blank questions) based on contextual and semantic information inferred from the videos. The proposed solution takes a human-centred approach, wherein teachers are provided the ability to modify/edit any AI generated questions. This approach encourages trust and engagement of teachers in the use and implementation of AI in education. The AI-based solution was evaluated for its accuracy in generating questions by 7 experienced teaching professionals and 117 education videos from multiple domains provided to us by our industry partner VidVersity.

Most current studies on this subject appear to be focused on broad and private annotated data which are impractical to access from an organization, particularly while radiologists are fighting the coronavirus disease. It is challenging to equate these techniques since they were built on separate datasets, educated on various training sets, and tested using different metrics. In this research, a deep learning semantic segmentation architecture for COVID-19 lesions detection in limited chest CT datasets will be presented. The proposed model architecture consists of the encoder and the decoder components. The encoder component contains three layers of convolution and pooling, while the decoder contains three layers of deconvolutional and upsampling. The dataset consists of 20 CT scans of lungs belongs to 20 patients from two sources of data. The total number of images in the dataset is 3520 CT scans with its labelled images. The dataset is split into 70% for the training phase and 30% for the testing phase. Images of the dataset are passed through the pre-processing phase to be resized and normalized. Five experimental trials are conducted through the research with different images selected for the training and the testing phases for every trial.

We described the timing and most common causes of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission following an index hospitalization for pneumonia or sepsis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This national retrospective cohort study included adults 65 years who were hospitalized for pneumonia or sepsis and were discharged to a SNF between July 1, 2012 and July 4, 2015. We quantified the ten most common 30-day unplanned readmission diagnoses and estimated the daily risk of first unplanned rehospitalization for four causes of readmission (circulatory, infectious, respiratory, and genitourinary). The index hospitalization was pneumonia for 92,153 SNF stays and sepsis for 452,254 SNF stays. Of these SNF stays, 20.9% and 25.9%, respectively, resulted in a 30-day unplanned readmission. Overall, septicemia was the single most common readmission diagnosis for residents with an index hospitalization for pneumonia (16.7% of 30-day readmissions) and sepsis (22.4% of 30-day readmissions). The mean time to unplanned readmission was approximately 14 days overall. Respiratory causes displayed the highest daily risk of rehospitalization following index hospitalizations for pneumonia, while circulatory and infectious causes had the highest daily risk of rehospitalization following index hospitalizations for sepsis. The day of highest risk for readmission occurred within two weeks of the index hospitalization discharge, but the readmission risk persisted across the 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSION: Among older adults discharged to SNFs following a hospitalization for pneumonia or sepsis, hospital readmissions for infectious, circulatory, respiratory, and genitourinary causes occurred frequently throughout the 30-day post-discharge period. Our data suggests further study is needed, perhaps on the value of closer monitoring in SNFs post-hospital discharge and improved communication between hospitals and SNFs, to reduce the risk of potentially preventable hospital readmissions.","output":"Causes and timing of 30-day rehospitalization from skilled nursing facilities after a hospital admission for pneumonia or sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we propose to bridge two worlds as we suggest to repurpose artificial intelligence solutions originally developed for telecommunications systems in the field of fighting against a pandemic. The objective is to provide solutions supporting the global effort to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The European Telecommunications Standards Institute has published an architecture group specification that introduces a number of building blocks and a general high-level approach enabling automated data analysis and related decision-making in the context of large-scale communication systems. We illustrate how the available structure can be adapted to the needs and analysis of patient allocation in the context of a pandemic and scarce resources. Thus learning and decision-making processes may be applied for the extraction of information related to the pandemic evolution and forecast, as well as the health system optimization. An artificial intelligence (AI) system is indeed ideally suited to extract relevant information from a data pool and to train decision-making algorithms for modeling the spread of a pandemic. Instead of using AI tools in medical diagnostics for a single patient, we propose to extend the approach to a country-wide optimization to optimally allocate patients and available medical resources and show how discrete optimization tools may provide an optimum mapping under the given constraints such as limited medical resources. As a consequence, the analysis and processing of such data by public services is optimized considerably building on state-of-the-art data analytics as originally developed in a different field.","output":"COVID-19 lethality reduction using artificial intelligence solutions derived from telecommunications systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, there are no firm guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19-related emotional distress.

This study evaluated the relative impact of maternal and fetal characteristics on (1) the timing of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) and (2) fetal and postnatal outcomes. METHODS This retrospective multicenter cohort study included women with a fetal echocardiogram diagnosis of CHD from 2010-2019. Women were grouped into quartiles of social vulnerability (Q1-4; low-high) using the 2014 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fetal disease severity score (range 1-7) was calculated based on CHD severity (mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe two ventricle = 3, severe single ventricle = 4), and prenatally diagnosed genetic abnormality, non-cardiac abnormality, and fetal hydrops (1 each). Late diagnosis was defined as a fetal echocardiogram diagnosis of CHD after 24 weeks gestation. RESULTS Among 441 pregnancies included, 94 (21%) had a late diagnosis of CHD. Late diagnosis was more common in the most socially vulnerable quartile (38%) than the other 3 quartiles (14-18%). Late diagnosis was also associated with Catholic or other Christian religion versus non-denominational or other religion, and with a lower fetal disease severity score. In the study group, there were 93 (21%) pregnancy terminations and 26 (6%) in-utero demises. Factors associated with pregnancy termination included early diagnosis and higher fetal disease severity. Compared to other quartiles, the most socially vulnerable quartile had a higher incidence of fetal demise and a lower incidence of pregnancy termination. Among the 322 live births, 46 (14%) died or underwent heart transplant in follow-up. Factors associated with postnatal death or heart transplant included longer delay between obstetric ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram and higher fetal disease severity. CONCLUSIONS High social vulnerability, Catholic or other Christian religion, and low fetal disease severity are associated with late prenatal CHD diagnosis. Delays in CHD diagnosis are associated with less TOP and worse postnatal outcomes. Therefore, efforts to expedite fetal echocardiography following obstetric screening, particularly for at-risk women (e.g., high SVI), have the potential to impact pregnancy and postnatal outcomes among the prenatally diagnosed CHD population.

The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive? METHODS: Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior. RESULTS: Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public.

Furthermore, the economic devastation caused by the pandemic, including an increase in unemployment, gives rise to numerous challenges, such as food insecurity, which is likely to worsen childhood nutritional status. Also, COVID-19 has ongoing effects on the mental wellbeing of children, driven in part by the interruption of schooling and other opportunities to socialise.

Across three experiments using a yes/no recognition paradigm, the presence of a mask was orthogonally manipulated at the study and the test phases. All data showed no evidence of matching effects. In Experiment 1, the presence of masks either at study or test impaired the correct identification of a target. But in Experiments 2 and 3, in which the presence of masks at study or test was manipulated within participants, only masks presented at test-only impaired face identification. In these conditions, test expectations led participants to use similar encoding strategies to process masked and unmasked faces. Across all studies, participants were more liberal (i.e., used a more lenient criterion) when identifying masked faces presented at the test. We discuss these results and propose that to better understand how people may identify a face wearing a mask, researchers should take into account that memory is an active process of discrimination, in which expectations regarding test conditions may induce an encoding strategy that enables overcoming perceptual deficits.","output":"That person is now with or without a mask: how encoding context modulates identity recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NTT is promoting the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN) to provide an information and communication technology infrastructure that brings about various benefits The company is pursuing research and development of key technologies to implement IOWN in 2030 Now that the entire world has been hit by an unprecedented situation due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, expectations for NTT's efforts based on its philosophy of contributing to society are growing We talked with Katsuhiko Kawazoe, NTT Senior Vice President, Head of Research and Development Planning Department, about the attitude of his department-which ought to be called the brain of NTT-to tackle this crisis and the sense of value of NTT researchers ? 2020 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp All rights reserved","output":"Turning crisis into opportunity for transformation: Understand the world and discover unknown value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis mainly affecting children below 5 years of age.

A considerable percentage of patients expected a very high/high infection risk in a hospital (48.3%) or at a doctor's practice (37.9%). Major sources of information were the patients' general practitioners (48.9%) and the internet (31.5%). Assignment to a high risk group (? = 1.04) and uncertainty in terms of assignment (? = 1.26) were significantly (p = 0.01) associated with a higher level of health-related worries. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with previous PE feel that they belong to a high risk group in terms of severe illness from COVID-19. Support in coping with their individual COVID-19 risk is warranted.","output":"COVID-19 risk perceptions, worries and preventive behaviors in patients with previous pulmonary embolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2005, a randomized trial showed that addition of surgery to radiotherapy improved outcomes in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC).

Seventy-nine patients receiving radiotherapy alone were matched to 79 patients assigned to surgery plus radiotherapy (propensity score method) for age, gender, performance score, tumor type, affected vertebrae, other bone or visceral metastases, interval tumor diagnosis to MSCC, time developing motor deficits, and ambulatory status. Improvement of motor function by 1 Frankel grade occurred more often after surgery plus radiotherapy (39.2% vs. 21.5%, p = 0.015). No significant differences were found for post-treatment ambulatory rates (59.5% vs. 67.1%, p = 0.32), local progression-free survival (p = 0.47), overall survival (p = 0.51), and freedom from in-field recurrence of MSCC (90.1% vs. 76.2% at 12 months, p = 0.58).

INTRODUCTION Virtual simulation has emerged as a feasible alternative to in-person learning, allowing learners to continue their education despite constraints of space, finances, and clinical placement opportunities. Virtual simulation has proven to be a vital resource for health care students during the COVID-19 pandemic. While virtual simulation provides students with continued opportunities to develop knowledge and critical thinking in a safe environment, debriefing is a crucial step for successful knowledge uptake and deeper learning. Several studies have examined this topic in various health care settings; however, there are currently no scoping reviews that have explored virtual simulation debriefing in health professions education. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review will consider primary and secondary source articles that explore debriefing of virtual simulation within any undergraduate or graduate health education programs. Any setting that provides virtual simulation and debriefing, in any country, will be included. METHODS The review will be conducted in accordance with JBI methodology for scoping reviews and will search the following databases: Cochrane Library, JBI Evidence-based Practice Database, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Epistemonikos, Embase, ERIC, PsycINFO, Nursing and Allied Health Database, and Web of Science. Studies published from 2016 onward will be considered.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effectiveness of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with and without enrofloxacin in the treatment of moderate grade dog bite wounds (DBW). To describe common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-centre parallel group pragmatic trial, 50 dogs presenting with moderate grade DBW were prospectively randomised to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (group A) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin (group B). Swabs were taken for culture and susceptibility testing at admission. Stabilisation, wound care and surgical debridement were performed at the discretion of admitting clinicians. The primary outcome was complication due to infection at 10 days, with Bayesian inference used to estimate the difference in proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS: Of the 24 dogs in treatment group A, 1 required the addition of enrofloxacin at re-examination. None of the 26 dogs in group B required alteration of antimicrobial coverage. The difference in complication rate due to infection between treatment groups was 4.2%. Twenty-one different organisms were identified: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Neisseria spp., Pasteurella multocida and P. canis were the most common. Over 90% of gram-negative and gram-positive isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Ninety-six percent of gram-negative and 86% of gram-positive isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an appropriate empirical antimicrobial choice for moderate DBW in South East Queensland.

As of now, the usual practice is to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which provides results in 24-48 hours. Hence, there exists a crucial need for rapid and immediate screening of people suspected to be infected. Presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath can be one such prospect for detection of virus. In this paper, we have designed chromophoric adducts of VOC's in the exhaled breath that can be formed for colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2. We noted the bathochromic shift in  (nm) of VOC molecules upon chromophore formation for colorimetric detection. If adapted, this research work will result in low cost solution to the requirement of immediate detection of SARS-CoV-2, hence cost and time of testing will be reduced, compared to PCR and antibodies tests.

The use of electronic noses (ENs) for exhaled breath analysis has the potential to provide useful information for phenotyping different respiratory disorders and improving diagnosis, but their application in respiratory failure patients remains a challenge. We developed a novel measurement apparatus for analysing exhaled breath in such patients. Methods: The breath sampling apparatus uses hospital medical air and oxygen pipeline systems to control the fraction of inspired oxygen and prevent contamination of exhaled gas from ambient Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) It is designed to minimise the dead space and respiratory load imposed on patients. Breath odour fingerprints were assessed using a commercial EN with custom MOX sensors. We carried out a feasibility study on 33 SARS-CoV-2 patients (25 with respiratory failure and 8 asymptomatic) and 22 controls to gather data on tolerability and for a preliminary assessment of sensitivity and specificity. The most significant features for the discrimination between breath-odour fingerprints from respiratory failure patients and controls were identified using the Boruta algorithm and then implemented in the development of a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. Results: The novel sampling system was well-tolerated by all patients. The SVM differentiated between respiratory failure patients and controls with an accuracy of 0.81 (area under the ROC curve) and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.920 and 0.682, respectively. The selected features were significantly different in SARS-CoV-2 patients with respiratory failure versus controls and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients (p < 0.001 and 0.046, respectively).

It helps in identifying domains requiring improvements to provide high quality pharmacy services to ensure the provision of enhanced pharmaceutical care. The current study aims to ascertain the extent of satisfaction towards pharmacy services among patients attending outpatient pharmacies in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 746 patients attending outpatient pharmacies of various public hospitals was conducted from 01 January to 15 February 2020. Information on socio-demographic profile of the study subjects along with their satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy was extracted by using a 23-items questionnaire. These questions were divided into two domains including 7 questions related to the pharmacy facilities (questions from 1F to 7F) and 8 questions for pharmacy services (questions from 1S to 8S), where F and S denotes facilities and services, respectively. The cumulative satisfaction score was estimated by a 5-item Likert scale with a maximum score of 5 for each item. The relationship between demographics and satisfaction scores was evaluated by using appropriate statistics. RESULTS: There were 746 patients with male preponderance (58.8%). The overall satisfaction score was 2.97  0.65. Satisfaction towards pharmacy services scored lower (mean score: 3.91  0.77) than pharmacy facilities (mean score: 4.03  0.66).

It adversely affects the routine health care delivery and health service uptake by patients. However, its impact on care-seeking behaviour is largely unknown in Ethiopia. ObjectiveThis study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic health condition at Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital in Addis Ababa. MethodsA cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted between May and July 2020 on patients whose appointment was between March to June 2020. Sample of 750 patients were approached using phone call and data collection was done using a pretested questionnaire. After cleaning, the data entered in to IBM SPSS software package for analysis. ResultsA total of 644 patients with a median age of 25 years, and M: F ratio of 1:1.01 was described with a response rate of 86%. A loss to follow up, missed medication and death occurred in 70%, 12%, and 1.3% of the patients respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients above 60 years old were more likely to miss follow-up (OR-23.28 (9.32-58.15), P<001). Patients who reported fear of COVID-19 at the hospital were 19 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=19.32, 95% CI:10.73-34.79, P<0.001), while patients who reported transportation problems were 6.5 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=6.11, 95% CI:3.06-12.17, P<0.001). ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic affected the care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic medical condition adversely and the impact was more pronounced among patients with severe disease, fear of COVID19 and with transportation problems. Education on preventive measures of COVID-19, use of phone clinic and improving chronic illness services at the local health institutions may reduce loss to follow-up among these patients.

Due to global reduction in birth rates and reduced mortality, in year 2025 there will be about 1.2 billion of people over age of sixty, worldwide. The notion that the real age is not chronological, but the biological one led to the concept of \\"bioage\\", defining the biologic reactivity and resilience, including the immune competence of an individual. A competent immune network, systemic and mucosal is intrinsic to resilience and homeostasis of the human holobiont as the unit of evolution. In elderly, the immunosenescence could be associated with higher levels of proinflammatory mediators (such as IL-6), frialty and mortality. Proi-inflammatory state in elderly is denoted as inflammaging, characterized with low-grade (sterile) inflammation, as a physiologic response to life-long antigenic stimuli. When under control, inflammaging could be regarded as an efficient defense mechanism, oposed and regulated by anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules. Immunosensecence. The emerging concepts of \\"individual immunobiography\\" and \\"trained immunity\\" speak in favour that the immunological experience during the life would shape the ability of each individual to respond to various stimuli, strongly influencing the elements of innate and adaptive immunity, including macrophages and innate lymphoid cells. Older age is one of the main risk factors for the severe clinical picture and adverse outcome of COVID-19 infection, due to immunosenscence and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), both characterizing the immune reactioin in elderly. The senescent immune system, along with the advanced process of inflammaging is prone to react with uncontrolled activation of innate immune response that leads to cytokine release syndrome, tissue damage and adverse outcome of infection.

OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients older than 85 years and study risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients aged 85 years and older, admitted in noncritical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisire Fernand-Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included and followed up for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death. RESULTS: From March 14 to April 11, 2020, 76 patients (median age = 90 (86-92) years; women = 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID-19. Of the patients, 64.5% presented with three or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%) and confusion and delirium (71.1%). An initial fall was reported in 25.0% of cases, and digestive symptoms were reported in 22.4% of cases. COVID-19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9%, and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%), and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8-17) days. Males were overrepresented in nonsurvivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9-19.5) days. Independent predictive factors of death were C-reactive protein level at admission and lymphocyte count at nadir.

In November 2020, several mAbs were issued an EUA by the FDA as single-dose intravenous (IV) infusions for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. mABs were allocated to local health facilities capable of administering infusions and managing side effects. Creating an outpatient infusion program during the COVID-19 winter surge can be logistically difficult. Our goal was to implement a mAb outpatient infusion program at an urban safety-net community hospital designed to serve communities most heavily impacted by COVID-19. Methods The emergency department (ED) fast-track was repurposed for the mAb program with protocols from the infectious diseases physician and antimicrobial stewardship. Education materials with indications for mAbs were distributed in surrounding clinics serving our community. The program was available to all patients meeting criteria outlined in the protocol, 24/7, including but not limited to current ED patients and referrals from facilities in the vicinity. Results Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, a total of 37 patients were treated: 51% male, 57% Hispanic or Latinx, 27% Black, and 95% (35) represented ZIP codes with high COVID-19 burden (Figure 1). Bamlanivimab was used for each instance and all infusions met criteria. Patient indications for mAb infusion are listed in Figure 2. Parenteral antibiotics were given to 10.8% and 35% received oral antibiotics upon discharge. At 30 days post-infusion, 8% (3) required hospitalization and there were no deaths. Zip codes with high COVID-19 disease burden served by our mAB infusion program Distribution of patients who received mAB infusions by indication Conclusion A mAb outpatient infusion program was successfully deployed in a safety-net community hospital. We believe strengths of the program included the flexible infusion hours and convenient referral site for patients and providers. Of importance, this program was able to provide services to minorities from ZIP codes most heavily impacted by COVID-19. Unfortunately, antibacterial use was common and may reflect broader unnecessary use in COVID-19 patients. Whilst mAb treatment was deemed appropriate in all instances via protocol inclusion criteria, antibacterial stewardship programs may need to expand to ED settings for COVID-19 management.

This study discusses the impact of the COVID-19 curfew restrictions on university students' mental health, as this area was not fully discussed in previous studies. An online survey was distributed to cover the psychological symptoms and coping strategies of university students. Most of them experienced short temper, anxiety, and sleep problems. Female students expressed more psychological symptoms than males, they managed their stress by sleeping, studying, and worshiping. Whereas male students were working, exercising, and playing video games. A distinct interest was noticed among students of different ages. Young students (18-25 years) expressed unhappiness and distress-like symptoms; they advocated sleeping and playing video games. While elder students (>26 years) had anxiety, sleep problems, and short tempers, they managed their symptoms by studying, exercising, and worshiping.

Furthermore, early studies suggest faecal microbial transfer may have therapeutic potential, converting ICI non-responders into responders. So far, identification of specific responsible bacterial taxa has been inconsistent, which limits future application. The MITRE study will explore and validate a microbiome signature in a larger scale prospective study across several different cancer types. METHODS: Melanoma, renal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients who are planned to receive standard immune checkpoint inhibitors are being recruited to the MITRE study. Longitudinal stool samples are collected prior to treatment, then at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months during treatment, or at disease progression/recurrence (whichever is sooner), as well as after a severe (grade 3 CTCAE v5.0) immune-related adverse event. Additionally, whole blood, plasma, buffy coat, RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is collected at similar time points and will be used for exploratory analyses. Archival tumour tissue, tumour biopsies at progression/relapse, as well as any biopsies from body organs collected after a severe toxicity are collected. The primary outcome measure is the ability of the microbiome signature to predict 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced disease. Secondary outcomes include microbiome correlations with toxicity and other efficacy end-points. Biosamples will be used to explore immunological and genomic correlates. A sub-study will evaluate both COVID-19 antigen and antibody associations with the microbiome. DISCUSSION: There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, resistance and toxicity to immunotherapy. The data generated from this study will both help inform patient selection for these drugs and provide information that may allow therapeutic manipulation of the microbiome to improve future patient outcomes.

The incidence of invasive Candidal infection with bacterial bloodstream infection is increasing year by year worldwide, but data on China is still limited. METHODS: We included 246 hospitalised patients who had invasive candidal infection combined with a bacterial bloodstream infection from January 2013 to January 2018; we collected and analysed the relevant epidemiological information and used machine learning methods to find prognostic factors related to death (training set and test set were randomly allocated at a ratio of 7:3). RESULTS: Of the 246 patients with invasive candidal infection complicated with a bacterial bloodstream infection, the median age was 63 years (53.25C74), of which 159 (64.6%) were male, 109 (44.3%) were elderly patients (> 65 years), 238 (96.7%) were hospitalised for more than 10 days, 168 (68.3%) were admitted to ICU during hospitalisation, and most patients had records of multiple admissions within 2 years (167/246, 67.9%). The most common blood index was hypoproteinemia (169/246, 68.7%), and the most common inducement was urinary catheter use (210/246, 85.4%). Moreover, the most frequently infected fungi and bacteria were Candida parapsilosis and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively.

In this unprecedented situation, the cross approach and interaction between the French pharmacovigilance network and French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has been optimized to provide a real-time safety related to COVID-19 vaccines. Every week, pair of regional pharmacovigilance centers gathered safety data from the French pharmacovigilance network, to acutely expertise all the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with each COVID-19 vaccine within a direct circuit with ANSM. Results of this expertise are presented and discussed with ANSM in order to raise safety signals and take appropriate measures if necessary. These reports are then published online. At the 25th of March 2021, more than 9 815 000 doses were injected and 20,265 ADRs were reported, mostly non-serious (76%).

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (na? =a? 16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (na? =a? 130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity were associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.386; Pa? <a? .001) than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.211; Pa? =a? .026).

METHODS: The UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN) convened a meeting of practitioners and experts from England, Wales, and Scotland, to discuss issues that university students with ADHD can experience or present with during their programme of studies and how best to address them. A report on the collective analysis, evaluation, and opinions of the expert panel and published literature about the impact of ADHD on the educational outcomes of university students is presented. RESULTS: A consensus was reached that offers expert advice, practical guidance, and recommendations to support the medical, education, and disability practitioners working with university students with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Practical advice, guidance, and recommendations based on expert consensus can inform the identification of ADHD in university students, personalised interventions, and educational support, as well as contribute to existing research in this topic area. There is a need to move away from prevailing notions within higher education about ADHD being a specific learning difference (or difficulty) and attend to the urgent need for university students with ADHD to have timely access to treatment and support. A multimodal approach can be adapted to support university students with ADHD. This approach would view timely access to treatment, including reasonable adjustments and educational support, as having a positive impact on the academic performance and achievement of university students with ADHD.","output":"University students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a consensus statement from the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This paper analyzes results from focus groups held with women physicians in British Columbia which explored questions around how gender norms and roles influenced their experiences during COVID-19. METHODS: Four virtual focus groups were organized between July and September 2020. Participants (n = 27) were voluntarily recruited. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. RESULTS: In addition to the COVID-19-related changes experienced across the profession, women physicians faced distinct challenges related to an increase in unpaid care responsibilities, and often felt excluded from, and occasionally dismissed by, leadership. Women leaders often felt their contributions were unrecognized and undervalued. Participants drew strength from other women leaders, peer networks, and professional support, but these strategies were limited by unpaid care and emotional labour demands, which were identified as increasing risk of burnout. DISCUSSION: Even though women physicians hold a degree of relative privilege, unpaid care work and gender norms contribute to distinct secondary effects of COVID-19. Women physicians link these to pre-pandemic assumptions (within families and communities) that women would absorb care deficits at their own cost. Health system leadership continues to reflect a masculine normative experience wherein the personal and professional are separated, and which devalues the emotional labour often associated with feminine leadership. The strategies participants employed to address negative impacts, while demonstrating resourcefulness and peer support, reflect individualistic responses to social-structural challenges. There is a need for greater recognition of womens contributions at home and work, increased representation in decision-making, and practical supports such as childcare and counselling.","output":"I may be essential but someone has to look after my kids: women physicians and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected medical treatment protocols throughout the world.

Despite various studies conducted by researchers and doctors, no treatment has been developed until now, therefore self-protection and isolation are strongly recommended to stop the spread of the virus. The elderly population and people with chronic diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer are categorized as risk groups, however, we suggest that people with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria can be described as risk groups as well. Current in silico studies have revealed that the COVID-19 virus can attack heme and hemoglobin metabolisms which are responsible for the oxygen transport to the tissues, iron metabolism, elevated levels of oxidative stress, and tissue damage. Data of the in silico study have been supported with the biochemistry and hemogram results of the COVID-19 patients, for instance hemoglobin levels decreased and serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels increased. Indicated biochemistry biomarkers are tightly associated with inflammation, iron overload, and oxidative stress. In conclusion, since people with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria have already impaired heme and hemoglobin metabolism, COVID-19 infection can enhance the adverse effects of impaired hemoglobin metabolism and accelerate the progression of severe symptoms in patients with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria compared to the normal individuals. Thus those people can be considered as a risk group and extra precautions should be applied for them to protect them.","output":"People with blood disorders can be more vulnerable during COVID-19 pandemic: A Hypothesis Paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell fusion is an approach for combining genetic and epigenetic information between two different types of cells. Electrofusion for generating hybrid cells between mouse embryonic stem cells and somatic cells, which is a type of nonchemically induced and nonvirus-mediated cell fusion, is introduced here as a highly effective, reproducible, and biomedically safe in vitro system. Under optimized electrofusion conditions, cells are aligned and form pearl chains between electrodes in response to AC pulse stimulation, and subsequently adjacent cytoplasmic membranes are fused by DC pulse stimulation. Hybrid cells survive as drug-resistant colonies in selection medium. Cell fusion is a technique that is applied widely in the life sciences. A recent topic of great interest in the field of stem cell research is the successful production of cloned animals via epigenetic reprogramming of somatic nuclei. Interestingly, nuclear reprogramming for conferring pluripotency on somatic nuclei also occurs via cell fusion between pluripotential stem cells and somatic cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that spontaneous cell fusion contributes to generating the intrinsic plasticity of tissue stem cells.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided an excellent opportunity to investigate the possible methods to improve Beijing's air quality meanwhile considering Beijing's economic impact. We used the TVP-VAR model to analyze the dynamic relationship among the pandemic, economy and air quality based on the daily data from 1 January to 30 August 2020. The result shows that the COVID-19 pandemic indeed had a positive effect on air governance which was good for human health, while doing business as usual would gradually weaken this effect. It shows that the Chinese authority's production restriction effectively deals with air pollution in a short period of time since the pandemic is just like a quasi-experiment that suddenly suspended all the companies. However, as the limitation stops, the improvement decreases. It is not sustainable. In addition, a partial quarantine also has a positive impact on air quality, which means a partial limitation was also helpful in improving air quality and also played an important role in protecting people's health. Second, the control measures really hurt Beijing's economy. However, the partial quarantine had fewer adverse effects on the economy than the lockdown. It is supposed to be a reference for air governance and pandemic control. Third, the more the lag periods were, the smaller their impact. Thus, restrictions on production can only be used in emergencies, such as some international meetings, while it is hard to improve the air quality and create a healthy and comfortable living environment only by limitation in the long-term.","output":"The Dynamic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Air Quality: The Beijing Lessons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CATH (https://www.cathdb.info) identifies domains in protein structures from wwPDB and classifies these into evolutionary superfamilies, thereby providing structural and functional annotations.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can detect changes in cerebral oxygenation resulting from nociceptive stimuli in the awake state or under sedation. We used NIRS to measure changes in cerebral blood flow provoked by thoracotomy incision made under GA and determine how these changes were influenced by supplementation of GA with PVB. METHODS Thirty-four patients undergoing elective thoracotomy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to a group receiving only GA, or GA combined with PVB (GA + PVB). Changes in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxygenated-Hb (HHb), and total-Hb (totalHb) were evaluated by NIRS as surgery began. RESULTS In the GA group, O2Hb was significantly higher in the hemisphere contralateral to the side of surgery when the incision was made and 2 min after incision compared with the ipsilateral side (start of surgery, P < 0.01; 2 min, P < 0.05). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the O2Hb at any of the time points in the GA + PVB group. Comparable with O2Hb, the concentration of totalHb was significantly higher in the contralateral hemisphere in the GA group at the start of surgery (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Changes in the cerebral O2Hb concentration were detected by NIRS immediately after surgical incision under GA, but not in the presence of a PNB.

The fast propagation of the disease combined with the existence of covert contagions by asymptomatic individuals make the controlling of this disease particularly challenging.

The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R<1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0  0.7.

Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human bodys immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID C 19 is significantly low.

However, several limitations regarding its adoption are reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to provide an effective and efficient approach to investigating vaccine adherence against COVID-19 via Google Trends. METHODS: Through the cross-correlational analysis of well-targeted hypotheses, we investigate the predictive capacity of web searches related to COVID-19 toward vaccinations in Italy from November 2020 to November 2021. The keyword vaccine reservation query (VRQ) was chosen as it reflects a real intention of being vaccinated (V). Furthermore, the impact of the second most read Italian newspaper (vaccine-related headlines [VRH]) on vaccine-related web searches was investigated to evaluate the role of the mass media as a confounding factor. Fisher r-to-z transformation (z) and percentage difference () were used to compare Spearman coefficients. A regression model V=f(VRH, VRQ) was built to validate the results found. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was adopted (P*). SEs are reported. RESULTS: Simple and generic keywords are more likely to identify the actual web interest in COVID-19 vaccines than specific and elaborated keywords. Cross-correlations between VRQ and V were very strong and significant (min r2=0.460, P*<.001, lag 0 weeks; max r2=0.903, P*<.001, lag 6 weeks). The remaining cross-correlations have been markedly lower (>55.8%; z>5.8; P*<.001). The regression model confirmed the greater significance of VRQ versus VRH (P*<.001 vs P=.03, P*=.29). CONCLUSIONS: This research provides preliminary evidence in favor of using Google Trends as a surveillance and prediction tool for vaccine adherence against COVID-19 in Italy. Further research is needed to establish the appropriate use and limits of Google Trends for vaccination tracking. However, these findings prove that the search for suitable keywords is a fundamental step to reduce confounding factors. Additionally, targeting hypotheses helps diminish the likelihood of spurious correlations. It is recommended that Google Trends be leveraged as a complementary infoveillance tool by government agencies to monitor and predict vaccine adherence in this and future crises by following the methods proposed in this paper.","output":"Google Trends as a Predictive Tool for COVID-19 Vaccinations in Italy: Retrospective Infodemiological Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes is essential for the design of effective vaccines capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies and long-term immunity.

We propose a time-series analysis as an alternative to the current practice of using ad hoc year-on-year comparisons.

Newer devices are being invented in an effort to separate upper from lower respiratory organisms to make test results more relevant. Several outcome studies in patients with viral CAP are reviewed. SUMMARY In addition to clinical correlation, using biomarkers can be useful to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP. Outcomes in patients with a co-infection are generally worse as a viral infection may predispose someone to a bacterial pneumonia.

There is no evidence of the availability of any measurement tools to assess exercise adherence in the Nepalese context and cultural background. Therefore, we conducted a cross-cultural adaptation of the EARS into the Nepali language and investigated its reliability and validity. METHODS: Cross-cultural adaptation of the EARS was done based on Beaton guidelines. Psychometric properties were evaluated among 18 participants aged 18 years or older with pre-diabetes or confirmed diagnosis of any disease who were prescribed with home exercises by physiotherapists. Any disease that limited participants from doing exercise and individuals unwilling to participate were excluded. Reliability was evaluated through internal consistency, using Cronbachs alpha. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed to explore construct validity and confirm its unidimensionality. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was analyzed to identify cut-off score, sensitivity and specificity of the tool. RESULTS: The Cronbachs alpha was 0.94 for EARS-adherence behavior. The EFA of 6-items adherence behavior revealed the presence of one factor with an eigenvalue exceeding one. The scree-plot suggested for extraction of only one factor with strong loading (75.84%). The Area Under the Curve was 0.91 with 95% confidence interval 0.77C1.00 at p = 0.004. The cutoff score was found 17.5 with 89% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The EARS was cross-culturally adapted to the Nepali language. The reliability and construct validity of the Nepali version of the EARS were acceptable to assess exercise adherence in Nepali-speaking individuals. This validated tool might facilitate the evaluation of exercise-related interventions.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patients and caregivers of IBD patients regarding their concerns and worries related to own health, access to treatment and availability of factor concentrates and their experiences related to medical care. METHODS: Multicentre, cross-sectional study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of IBD patients. An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and sent to 586 patients/caregivers with haemophilia A, haemophilia B and VWD type III. The survey included information on demographic and clinical data, needs, concerns and experiences regarding medical care during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 355 of the IBD-Group (200 patients, 155 caregivers) completed the survey (61.7% response rate). Most patients suffered from haemophilia A (73.8%) and were severely affected (64.7%). Eleven patients were in quarantine due to suspected COVID-19; none had symptoms. One quarter worried (very) strongly about getting the coronavirus, 71.3% asked themselves what will happen to them when they will get COVID-19, 40.1% felt unchanged, and 18.9% worried about delivery difficulties of their IBD treatment product. In 52.8%, medical appointments were postponed. Significant differences between caregivers and patients were found in most aspects. DISCUSSION: The IBD patients affected by a chronic disorder have particular thoughts and worries regarding COVID-19.

Early and automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to slow down the spread of this epidemic and reduce the mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-center sparse learning (MCSL) and decision fusion scheme exploiting chest CT images for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically, considering the inconsistency of data in multiple centers, we first convert CT images into histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) images to reduce the structural differences between multi-center data and enhance the generalization performance. We then exploit a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model to learn the useful information between and within 3D HOG image slices and extract multi-center features. Furthermore, we employ the proposed MCSL method that learns the intrinsic structure between multiple centers and within each center, which selects discriminative features to jointly train multi-center classifiers. Finally, we fuse these decisions made by these classifiers. Extensive experiments are performed on chest CT images from five centers to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve COVID-19 diagnosis performance and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Multi-center sparse learning and decision fusion for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Illnesses requiring hospitalization are known to negatively impact psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after discharge. The impact of hospitalization during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on psychological well-being and health-related quality of life is expected to be higher due to the exceptional circumstances within and outside the hospital during the pandemic surge. The objective of this study was to quantify psychological distress up to three months after discharge in patients hospitalized during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave. We also aimed to determine HRQoL, to explore predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL, and to examine whether psychological distress was higher in COVID-19 confirmed patients, and in those treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). METHODS: In this single-center, observational cohort study, adult patients hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 between March 16 and April 28, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were stratified in analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR results and the necessity for ICU treatment. The primary outcome was psychological distress, expressed as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, up to three months post-discharge. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was the secondary outcome. Exploratory outcomes comprised predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL. RESULTS: 294 of 622 eligible patients participated in this study (median age 64 years, 36% female). 16% and 13% of these patients reported probable PTSD, 29% and 20% probable anxiety, and 32% and 24% probabledepression at one and three months after hospital discharge, respectively. ICU patients reported less frequently probable depression, but no differences were found in PTSD, anxiety, or overall HRQoL. COVID-19 patients had a worse physical quality of life one month after discharge, and ICU patients reported a better mental quality of life three months after discharge. PTSD severity was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Severity of anxiety was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Depression severity was predicted by time after discharge and educational level. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 suspected patients hospitalized during the pandemic frequently suffer from psychological distress and poor health-related quality of life after hospital discharge. Non-COVID-19 and non-ICU patients appear to be at least as affected as COVID-19 and ICU patients, underscoring that (post-)hospital pandemic care should not predominantly focus on COVID-19 infected patients.","output":"Psychological distress and health-related quality of life in patients after hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single-center, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: In this era of patient-centered care, it is increasingly important for HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs to customize their services according to patients' clinical stage progression and other risk assessments. To enable such customization of HIV care and treatment delivery, the research evidence explaining factors associated with patients' clinical stages is needed. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to produce such scientific evidence by analyzing the most recent data for patients at outpatient clinics in the provinces of Kinshasa and Haut-Katanga and to examine the patient characteristics associated with WHO stages of disease progression. METHODS: Using a quantitative retrospective cohort study design, we analyzed data from 49,460 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 241 HIV/AIDS clinics located in Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We performed Chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A small proportion (i.e., 4.4%) of PLHIV were at WHO's clinical progression stage 4, whereas 30.7% were at clinical stage 3, another 22.9% at stage 2, and the remaining 41.9% were at stage 1, the least severe stage. After controlling for other demographic and clinical factors included in the model, the likelihood of being at stage 1 rather than stage 3 or 4 was significantly higher (at p &#8804; 0.05) for patients with no tuberculosis (TB) than those with TB co-infection (adjusted odds ratio or AOR, 5.73; confidence interval or CI, 4.98-6.59). The odds of being at stage 1 were significantly higher for female patients (AOR, 1.35; CI, 1.29-1.42), and those with the shorter duration on ART (vs. greater than 40.37 months). Patents in rural health zones (AOR, 0.32) and semi-rural health zones (AOR, 0.79) were less likely to be at stage 1, compared to patients in urban health zones. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that TB co-infection raised the risk for PLHIV to be at the severe stages of clinical progression of HIV. Such variation supports the thesis that customized HIV management approaches and clinical regimens may be imperative for this high-risk population. We also found significant variation in HIV clinical progression stages by geographic location and demographic characteristics. Such variation points to the need for more targeted efforts to address the disparities, as the programs attempt to improve the effectiveness of HIV care and treatment. The intersectionality of vulnerabilities from HIV, TB, and COVID-19-related hardships has elevated the need for customized care and treatment even more in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Disparities in HIV Clinical Stages Progression of Patients at Outpatient Clinics in Democratic Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading very quickly around the world. In less than 7 months since it became known to the international community, the virus has infected 18 million in more than 180 countries and killing more than 700,000 people. Person-to-person transmission through infected respiratory droplets from patients with symptoms and asymptomatic carriers is the main mode of spread in the community. There is currently no standard agreed upon drug to treat the disease and the prospect of having a safe and efficacious vaccine might be years away. Thus, public health interventions such as social distancing and hand washing have been introduced and has, to some extent, slowed the progression of the pandemic. Universal masking as a public health intervention is currently mandatory in a vast majority of countries around the world. To avoid personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage crisis for medical staff and other frontline workers, health authorities are recommending the use cloth masks. Although in theory, cloth masks can be helpful to limit the spread of the COVID-19, serious consideration should be given to the choice of textile, the number of layers of cloth used, pre-treatment of the material with water repellent material and other compounds that can enhance the filtration efficiency of the masks without compromising their breathability.

In this report we share key lessons learned from an adaptive COVID-19 testing program implemented at a mid-sized university in the Midwest. The program utilized two simple, diverse, and easily interpretable machine learning models to quickly and accurately predict which students were at elevated risk for contracting COVID-19 and should be called proactively for testing. Our adaptive testing cohorts produced positivity rates that were 26% higher than the random cohort: 0.58% positivity (95% CI 0.47% to 0.68%) from 19,171 tests, and 0.46% positivity (95% CI 0.41% to 0.51%) from 64,003 tests, respectively. Within 14 days of their selection, 2.94% of the adaptive cohort tested positive, compared to 1.27% of the random cohort. Close contacts who were predicted by the adaptive testing models received a COVID-19 test within an average of 0.94 days (95% CI 0.78 to 1.11) of the source testing positive, while those who were manually contact traced were tested in an average of 1.92 days (95% CI 1.81 to 2.02).

Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS: Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8a??a??3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9a??a??10.8%, pa??<a??0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0a??a??8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION: Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention. Ideal protection of medical staff is achieved when the procedure is performed under endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation.","output":"Aerosol Exposure During Surgical Tracheotomy in SARS-CoV-2 Positive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many individuals prescribed osteoporosis pharmacotherapy either do not start or do not persist with treatment. In this study, women who attended a group medical visit at an osteoporosis center which involved fracture risk assessment and focused on autonomous decision-making made treatment decisions with high confidence. Those who started pharmacotherapy were highly persistent. PURPOSE: Adherence and persistence with osteoporosis pharmacotherapy is low, possibly reflecting lack of confidence in physicians' treatment recommendations. We evaluated treatment decisions, decisional confidence, and 12-month treatment adherence among women who attended a group bone health consultation that fostered autonomous decision-making. METHODS: We prospectively assessed postmenopausal women referred to an osteoporosis clinic who chose to attend a group medical visit in lieu of one-on-one consultation. The group visit was facilitated by a specialist physician and nurse, involving estimation of 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk (using FRAX?) and extensive education regarding fracture consequences and potential advantages and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. No direct advice was given by the specialist. Post-consult, participants made an autonomous decision regarding treatment intent and followed up with their family physician to enact their chosen plan. Intentions to initiate pharmacotherapy were assessed immediately post-consult. Treatment status and decisional confidence were evaluated 3 and 12 months later. Three-month treatment status was considered to reflect final treatment decision. Persistence was defined as proportion of participants on treatment at 3 months who remained treated at 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred one women (mean (SD) age, 62.7 years (5.8); median (IQR) FRAX?, 10.7% (8.3-17.6)) participated. Immediately post-consult, 27 (26.7%) intended to initiate treatment.

We assess if ORF8 protein bears super antigenic features using in silico tools. We show that ORF8 has properties of an extracellular soluble protein and shares a significant degree of amino acid sequence identity with toxic shock syndrome toxin. Besides, docking and binding affinity analyses between monomeric and homodimeric ORF-8 with V 2.1 and TRBV11-2 reveal strong interaction and high binding affinity.

The administration of immunomodulatory therapies has been proposed to revert the tissue damage induced by COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The present review summarizes the biological rationale and available clinical experience with this therapeutic strategy in the specific scenario solid organ transplantation (SOT). RECENT FINDINGS: A number of case reports, case series, and non-controlled cohort studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal tocilizumab in SOT (namely kidney transplantation) recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia and CRS. Although the heterogeneity in patient management and the lack of a control group limit the interpretation of these results, tocilizumab therapy appears to provide some clinical benefit in post-transplant COVID-19 and to be reasonably safe in terms of bacterial superinfection. A large randomized clinical trial (RCT) has shown survival benefit with adjuvant corticosteroids in non-transplant patients, but supporting evidence is scarce for SOT recipients and confounded by the variable adjustment of baseline immunosuppression. Anecdotal experiences have been reported with the use of the anti-IL-1 agent anakinra and the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor colchicine in this population. SUMMARY: Immunomodulation has emerged as a promising option for SOT recipients with COVID-19-related CRS, with available experience mainly restricted to the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab. However, the supporting evidence is scarce and of low quality. In the absence of RCT, observational studies including well-matched control groups should be designed in future.","output":"Immunomodulatory Therapies for COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, an efficient heterogeneous catalyst based on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (CN) has been reported.

Data from ongoing surveillance projects captured the incidence dynamics of community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP), non-alveolar lower respiratory infections necessitating chest X-rays (NA-LRI), nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in non-respiratory visits, nasopharyngeal respiratory virus detection (by PCR), and nationwide invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Monthly rates (January-2020 through February-2021 vs. mean monthly rates 2016-2019 [expected rates]) adjusted for age and ethnicity, were compared. Findings: CAAP and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were strongly reduced (incidence rate ratios, [IRRs] 0.07 and 0.19, respectively); NA-LRI and non-pneumonia IPD were also reduced, with a lesser magnitude (IRRs, 0.46 and 0.42, respectively). In contrast, pneumococcal carriage prevalence was only slightly reduced and density of colonization and pneumococcal serotype distributions were similar to previous years.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of diisocyanate cross-linked acellular porcine dermal collagen mesh for parastomal hernia repair, with particular reference to the relationship of the stoma site to the rectus sheath. METHODS Hernias were repaired via a lateral approach, with onlay placement of the biologic mesh. A retrospective case note review and analysis of clinical outcomes was performed. The relationship of the stoma to the rectus sheath was determined by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative findings. RESULTS Over a 16-month period, 27 consecutive patients, median age 72 years, underwent parastomal hernia repair utilising onlay biologic mesh to reinforce the external oblique aponeurosis. There were 20 paracolostomy and seven paraileostomy hernias. Eleven stomas passed through the rectus sheath and 16 were lateral to it. Recurrences occurred in 3 of 11 stomas within and 12 of 16 stomas lateral to the rectus sheath (P = 0.022). The median time to recurrence was 10.1 months. The median follow up of patients without recurrence was 16.6 months (range 0.2-39.3). There was one perioperative death. One patient developed a superficial post-operative abscess that was managed conservatively, but there were no complications related to the biologic mesh and no mesh required removal. CONCLUSIONS For parastomal hernias within the rectus sheath, diisocyanate cross-linked porcine dermal collagen mesh onlay repair gives good results and is safe to use.

This article aims to increase the understanding of eco-efficiency and its influencing factors in Mongolia and to provide a reference for similar developing countries and regions to achieve green and sustainable development. This article used the Slacks-Based Measure of Efficiency (SBM) model with advantages of dimension freedom and unit variable to estimate the economic efficiency and eco-efficiency of 22 provinces in Mongolia from 2007 to 2016; energy consumption and undesirable environmental outputs were taken as ecological/environmental indicators in the input and output system of regional eco-efficiency in Mongolia, combining traditional indicators of economic efficiency to build Mongolias eco-efficiency inputCoutput framework. This article applied hot spot analysis and gravity center analysis to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution characters of eco-efficiency in Mongolia. Finally, the article applied panel Tobit regression to analyze the influencing factors of eco-efficiency. We were found that Mongolias eco-efficiency slightly improved from 0.7379 in 2007 to 0.7673 in 2016, lower than the economic efficiency. The high eco-efficiency provinces appeared in the capital Ulaanbaatar and its surrounding areas, showing an obvious spatial spillover effect. The low eco-efficiency provinces were mainly in the undeveloped western region. The relationship between per capita GDP and eco-efficiency was U-shaped and consistent with environmental Kuznets theory.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SNF patients using 100% Medicare inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set resident assessment data. Linear probability models were used to estimate the probability of successful discharge based on patient and staff beliefs about the patient's ability to improve in function and patients and staff beliefs together. Estimates were adjusted for demographic, health status, functional characteristics, and SNF fixed effects. PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged &#8805;66 years who were discharged to a SNF following hospitalization for stroke, hip fracture or TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful community discharge (discharged alive within 90 days of SNF admission and remaining in the community for &#8805; 30 days without dying or health care facility readmission). RESULTS: Patients with positive beliefs about their capability to increase independence with ADLs had a higher adjusted probability of successful discharge than patients with negative beliefs (positive: 63.8%, negative: 57.8%, difference: 6.0%, 95%CI=5.4, 6.6%). This remained true regardless of staff beliefs, but the difference in successful discharge probability between patients with positive and negative beliefs was larger when staff had positive beliefs. Conversely, the association between staff beliefs and successful discharge varied based on patient beliefs: if patients had positive beliefs, the difference in the probability of successful discharge between positive and negative staff beliefs was 2.5% (95%CI=1.0, 4.0). If patients had negative beliefs, the difference between positive and negative staff beliefs was -4.6% (95%CI=-6.0, -3.2).

IMPDH1 plays a unique role in retinal metabolism, and point mutants cause blindness. Here, in a series of cryogenic-electron microscopy structures we show that human IMPDH1 assembles polymorphic filaments with different assembly interfaces in extended and compressed states. Retina-specific splice variants introduce structural elements that reduce sensitivity to GTP inhibition, including stabilization of the extended filament form. Finally, we show that IMPDH1 disease mutations fall into two classes: one disrupts GTP regulation and the other has no effect on GTP regulation or filament assembly.

Little is known about COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to evaluate the influence of preexisting COPD on the progress and outcomes of COVID-19. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. We enrolled 1,048 patients aged 40 years and above, including 50 patients with COPD and 998 patients without COPD, and with COVID-19 confirmed via high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, between December 11, 2019 and February 20, 2020. We collected data of demographics, pathologic test results, radiologic imaging, and treatments. The primary outcomes were composite endpoints determined by admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Compared with patients who had COVID-19 but not COPD, those with COPD had higher ratesof fatigue (56.0% vs. 40.2%), dyspnea (66.0% vs. 26.3%), diarrhea (16.0% vs. 3.6%), and unconsciousness (8.0% vs. 1.7%) and a significantly higher proportion of increased activated partial thromboplastin time (23.5% vs. 5.2%) and D-dimer (65.9% vs. 29.3%), as well as ground-glass opacities (77.6% vs. 60.3%), local patchy shadowing (61.2% vs. 41.4%), and interstitial abnormalities (51.0% vs. 19.8%) on chest computed tomography. Patients with COPD were more likely to develop bacterial or fungal coinfection (20.0% vs. 5.9%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (20.0% vs. 7.3%), septic shock (14.0% vs. 2.3%), or acute renal failure (12.0% vs. 1.3%). Patients with COPD and COVID-19 had a higher risk of reaching the composite endpoints [hazard ratio (HR): 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-3.38; P=0.001] or death (HR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.15-4.51; P=0.019), after adjustment.

Although several studies suggest that the spike protein of this virus interacts with the cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is subsequently cleaved by TMPRSS2 and FURIN to enter into the host cell, conclusive insight about the interaction pattern of the variants of these proteins is still lacking. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the functional conjugation among the spike protein, ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in viral pathogenesis as well as the effects of the mutations of the proteins through the implementation of several bioinformatics approaches. Analysis of the intermolecular interactions revealed that T27A (ACE2), G476S (receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the spike protein), C297T (TMPRSS2), and P812S (cleavage site for TMPRSS2) coding variants may render resistance in viral infection, whereas Q493L (RBD), S477I (RBD), P681R (cleavage site for FURIN), and P683W (cleavage site for FURIN) may lead to increase viral infection. Genotype-specific expression analysis predicted several genetic variants of ACE2 (rs2158082, rs2106806, rs4830971, and rs4830972), TMPRSS2 (rs458213, rs468444, rs4290734, and rs6517666), and FURIN (rs78164913 and rs79742014) that significantly alter their normal expression which might affect the viral spread. Furthermore, we also found that ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN proteins are functionally co-related with each other, and several genes are highly co-expressed with them, which might be involved in viral pathogenesis. This study will thus help in future genomics and proteomics studies of SARS-CoV-2 and will provide an opportunity to understand the underlying molecular mechanism during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","output":"Prediction of the Effects of Variants and Differential Expression of Key Host Genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis: An In Silico Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shift to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a need to develop technologies, resources, and strategies for teaching elementary grade learners online.

With access to these data, the authors extend that work and support a definite construct for auditory processing disorder (APD). The goal here is to examine MAPA-2 reliability and validity (construct, content, and concurrent). Evidence for the APD construct is further buttressed by measures of sensitivity and specificity. Results of MAPA-2 testing on children diagnosed with learning disability (LD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific language impairment (SLI) are included. Method Normative data (previously published as the MAPA-2) allowing derivation of these findings included a representative sample of 748 children (53% girls) ages 7-14 years tested by 54 speech-language pathologists and audiologists in 27 U.S. states. The authors examined diagnostic accuracy based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) criteria (index test) for confirmed cases of APD. The index was also used to identify listening problems for three other diagnostic categories (LD, ADHD, and SLI). Validated questionnaire responses from parents and school personnel allowed incorporation of functional measures widely supported in APD diagnosis but unavailable with other normative and sensitivity/specificity studies. Results Reliability and validity were both satisfactory, and diagnostic accuracy for an APD group of 18 (28% female) compared to the remaining typical group of 625 yielded 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity. The remaining three groups (LD, ADHD, and SLI), where comorbidity was expected to be about 50%, had APD-type listening problems with a prevalence ranging from 52% to 65%. Conclusions Current results provide important evidence for the construct of APD. The MAPA-2 can be administered by an audiologist or speech-language pathologist. A similar diagnostic protocol in Australia yielded positive therapeutic gains.

However, few options for validated at-home VA assessments are currently available. Objective: To validate 3 at-home visual acuity tests in comparison with in-office visual acuity. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between July 2020 and April 2021, eligible participants with VA of 20/200 or better were recruited from 4 university-based ophthalmology clinics (comprehensive, cornea, glaucoma, and retina clinics). Participants were prospectively randomized to self-administer 2 of 3 at-home VA tests (printed chart, mobile phone app, and website) within 3 days before their standard-of-care clinic visit. Participants completed a survey assessing usability of the at-home tests. At the clinic visit, best-corrected Snellen distance acuity was measured as the reference standard. Main Outcomes and Measures: The at-home VA test results were compared with the in-office VA test results using paired and unpaired t tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, analysis of variance, 2 tests, and Cohen  agreement. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each at-home test were calculated to detect significant VA changes (0.2 logMAR) from the in-office baseline. Results: A total of 121 participants with a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (13.0) years completed the study. The mean in-office VA was 0.11 logMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/25) with similar numbers of participants from the 4 clinics. Mean difference (logMAR) between the at-home test and in-office acuity was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.10 to -0.04) for the printed chart, -0.12 (95% CI, -0.15 to -0.09) for the mobile phone app, and -0.13 (95% CI, -0.16 to -0.10) for the website test.

Whether telomere injury induces mitochondrial dysfunction in human T lymphocytes, the major component of adaptive host immunity against infection and malignancy, remains unclear. We have recently shown that disruption of telomere integrity by KML001, a telomere-targeting drug, induces T cell senescence and apoptosis via the telomeric DNA damage response (DDR). In this study, we used KML001 to further investigate the role and mechanism of telomere injury in mitochondrial dysregulation in aging T cells. We demonstrate that targeting telomeres by KML001 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial swelling and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption, glycolysis, and ATP energy production. Mechanistically, we found that the KML001-induced telomeric DDR activated p53 signaling, which in turn repressed the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), leading to T cell mitochondrial dysfunction. These results, forging a direct link between telomeric and mitochondrial biology, shed new light on the human T cell aging network, and demonstrate that the p53-PGC-1-NRF-1 axis contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in the setting of telomeric DDR. This study suggests that targeting this axis may offer an alternative, novel approach to prevent telomere damage-mediated mitochondrial and T cell dysfunctions to combat a wide range of immune aging-associated human diseases.","output":"Telomeric injury by KML001 in human T cells induces mitochondrial dysfunction through the p53-PGC-1 pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that spreads directly between adjacent host cells without exposure to the extracellular space. Recent studies have identified several host cell factors that promote L. monocytogenes cell-to-cell spread in epithelial monolayers, but details of the mechanism remain unclear.

In particular, two point mutations in E-cadherins cytoplasmic domain that prevent its ubiquitination hinder bacterial cell-to-cell spread efficiency without reducing the extent of contact between neighboring cells. As ubiquitination induces E-cadherin endocytosis, we hypothesize that E-cadherin promotes protrusion engulfment, where donor cell protrusions containing L. monocytogenes are taken up by the recipient cell concurrently with E-cadherin internalization. In support of this hypothesis, we show that inhibiting caveolin-mediated membrane trafficking reduces L. monocytogenes cell-to-cell spread only under conditions where E-cadherin can be ubiquitinated. Additionally, we demonstrate that macropinocytosis also contributes to dissemination of L. monocytogenes through an epithelial monolayer.","output":"Listeria monocytogenes Co-opts Caveolin-Mediated E-cadherin Trafficking and Macropinocytosis for Epithelial Cell-to-Cell Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allotment gardens have existed in Europe for 170 years and have changed their functions over time While the scholarly literature emphasizes the economic, social and ecological benefits of allotment gardens, little is known about today's allotment gardeners, especially in different geopolitical environments This paper describes allotment gardeners' profiles based on empirical data obtained from surveys conducted in two countries with, on the one hand, a long tradition of allotment gardens and, on the other hand, a recent history of belonging to two different geopolitical regions: Poland and West Germany Inspired by the cultural-geographical approach that acknowledges that the gardening practice is influenced by culture and based on the method of non-hierarchical \\"k-means\\" clustering, this paper identifies characteristics of today's allotment gardeners from the region of Westphalia-Lippe in Germany and of Wielkopolska in Poland Significant differences in profiles were factored together in the statistical analysis based on garden practices and the meanings attributed to these practices as reported by the gardeners in the survey As a result, German gardeners can be described first and foremost as urban farmers and ecologists, while Polish allotmenteers seem to prefer using their gardens for leisure (as well as a holiday retreat) and for ornamental purposes Results can inform municipalities, stakeholders and garden organizations who are interested in adjusting existing allotment garden areas to meet future needs However, in both countries the community of gardeners cannot be conclusively defined, as it is subject to further development, triggered by a generational change in many allotment gardens For instance, in the context of the recent COVID-19 crisis, a significant increase in demand for allotment plots has been reported in both countries, which again confirms their role in times of crisis","output":"Between food growing and leisure: contemporary allotment gardeners in Western Germany and Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Peritraumatic distress as assessed by the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), has been consistently shown to predict the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after the exposure to a potentially traumatizing event Objective: The present study aims to validate the Italian version of the PDI in a sample of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19 related potentially traumatizing events Method: N = 265 HCWs who repeatedly experienced the deaths of patients during COVID-19 emergency in Italy, were enrolled from the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana (Pisa, Italy) They completed the PDI, Impact Event ScaleCrevised (IES-R) and the reactions to losses or upsetting events Trauma and Loss SpectrumCSelf Report (TALS-SR) domain Results: Internal consistency was good with a Cronbachs alpha coefficient was 874 The PDI correlated strongly with measures that was conceptually close (TALS-SR reactions to losses or upsetting events domain;r = 723, p &lt; 001) Participants who scored above the cut-off for PTSD reported significantly higher PDI scores than those who did not (6 47  5 25 vs 19 11  8 291, p &lt; 0 001) The one-month testCretest reliability (n = 21) was excellent (ICC = 997) Finally, factor analyses revealed that the PDI exhibited a single-factor structure Conclusions: the Italian version of the PDI showed good psychometric proprieties and may be used to detect those at risk for developing PTSD ? 2021 The Author(s) Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","output":"Validation of the Italian version of the peritraumatic distress inventory: validity, reliability and factor analysis in a sample of healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and affective disorders, may be at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nano-sized vesicles produced by gram-negative bacteria, and contain various bacterial components capable of stimulating the immune system of the host.

This retrospective multicenter pilot study aims to determine potential cell-free microRNAs (cfmiRs) that identify patients with pGBM and rGBM tumors. 2,083 miRs were assessed using the HTG miRNA whole transcriptome assay (WTA). CfmiRs detection was compared in pre-operative plasma samples from patients with pGBM (n = 32) and rGBM (n = 13) to control plasma samples from normal healthy donors (n = 73). 265 cfmiRs were found differentially expressed in plasma samples from pGBM patients compared to normal healthy donors (FDR < 0.05). Of those 193 miRs were also detected in pGBM tumor tissues (n = 15). Additionally, we found 179 cfmiRs differentially expressed in rGBM, of which 68 cfmiRs were commonly differentially expressed in pGBM. Using Random Forest algorithm, specific cfmiR classifiers were found in the plasma of pGBM, rGBM, and both pGBM and rGBM combined. Two common cfmiR classifiers, miR-3180-3p and miR-5739, were found in all the comparisons. In receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis for rGBM miR-3180-3p showed a specificity of 87.7% and a sensitivity of 100% (AUC = 98.5%); while miR-5739 had a specificity of 79.5% and sensitivity of 92.3% (AUC = 90.2%). This study demonstrated that plasma samples from pGBM and rGBM patients have specific miR signatures. CfmiR-3180-3p and cfmiR-5739 have potential utility in diagnosing patients with pGBM and rGBM tumors using a minimally invasive blood assay.","output":"Cell-free plasma microRNAs that identify patients with glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the lipocalin-2 (LIP2) and syndecan-4 (SYN4) levels in children who were hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP in order to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. The results regarding the LIP2 and SYN4 diagnostic outcomes were compared with the white blood cell (WBC) count and C reactive protein (CRP) levels. METHODS: A total of 110 children <14 years old who were hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP were enrolled. Serum samples were obtained upon admission and on day 5 to measure the levels of LIP2, SYN4, and CRP as well as the WBC. Polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory secretions and tests on blood samples were performed to detect respiratory viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS: CAP was considered to be due to a probable bacterial infection in 74 children (67.3 %) and due to a probable viral infection in 16 children (14.5 %). Overall, 84 children (76.4 %) were diagnosed with severe CAP. The mean values of the WBC count and the LIP2 and SYN4 levels did not differ among the probable bacterial, probable viral, and undetermined cases. However, the CRP serum concentrations were significantly higher in children with probable bacterial CAP than in those with probable viral disease (32.2  55.5 mg/L vs 9.4  17.0 mg/L, p < 0.05). The WBC count was the best predictor of severe CAP, but the differences among the studied variables were marginal. The WBC count was significantly lower on day 5 in children with probable bacterial CAP (p < 0.01) and in those with an undetermined etiology (p < 0.01). The CRP and LIP2 levels were significantly lower 5 days after enrollment in all of the studied groups, independent of the supposed etiology of CAP (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). No statistically significant variation was observed for SYN4. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the LIP2 and SYN4 levels does not appear to solve the problem of the poor reliability of routine laboratory tests in defining the etiology and severity of pediatric CAP. Currently, the CRP levels and WBC, when combined with evaluation of clinical data, can be used to limit the overuse of antibiotics as much as possible and to provide the best treatment to the patient.","output":"Measurement of lipocalin-2 and syndecan-4 levels to differentiate bacterial from viral infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health crisis leading to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide.

The influence of three factors is tested, namely, market orientation;environmental apathy alongside selected neutralization techniques, namely, appeal to higher loyalties;denial of injury and denial of responsibility.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses the method of a large-scale managerial survey (n = 292) administered in the commercial foodservice sector of Spain. The data are analysed via structural equation modelling with partial least squares.FindingsThe study finds that market orientation affects managerial intention to reduce FW but not their attitude, while environmental apathy influences managerial attitudes but not their behavioural intention. The study confirms the negative effect of such neutralizers as the appeal to higher loyalties and the denial of injury on suppressing managerial intention to reduce FW. Contrary to initial anticipations, another established neutralizer, the denial of responsibility, exerts no significant effect.Practical implicationsThe study elaborates on the interventions necessitated to neutralize the effect of the neutralizers on managerial (un)willingness to reduce FW in the commercial foodservice sector.Originality/valueThis is the first known attempt to understand the drivers of managerial engagement in FW reduction in the commercial foodservice sector through the prism of environmental apathy, market orientation and neutralization theory.","output":"Restaurant management and food waste reduction: factors affecting attitudes and intentions in restaurants of Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Methods to increase surgical preparedness in urogynecology are lacking. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a preoperative provider-initiated telehealth call on surgical preparedness. METHODS: This was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence were randomized to either a telehealth call 3 ( 2) days before surgery plus usual preoperative counseling versus usual preoperative counseling alone. Our primary outcome was surgical preparedness, as measured by the Preoperative Prepardeness Questionnaire. The Modified Surgical Pain Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20, Patient Global Impressions of Improvement, Patient Global Impressions of Severity, Satisfaction with Decision Scale, Decision Regret Scale, and ClavienCDindo scores were obtained at 4C8 weeks postoperatively and comparisons were made between groups. RESULTS: Mean telehealth call time was 11.1  4.11 min. Women who received a preoperative telehealth call (n = 63) were significantly more prepared for surgery than those who received usual preoperative counseling alone (n = 69); 82.5 vs 59.4%, p < 0.01). A preoperative telehealth call was associated with greater understanding of surgical alternatives (77.8 vs 59.4%, p = 0.03), complications (69.8 vs 47.8%, p = 0.01), hospital-based catheter care (54 vs 34.8%, p = 0.04) and patient perception that nurses and doctors had spent enough time preparing them for their upcoming surgery (84.1 vs 60.9%, p < 0.01). At 4C8 weeks, no differences in postoperative and patient reported outcomes were observed between groups (all p > 0.05).

As of the present, the SARS-CoV-2-borne disease is propagating in almost all countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in an unprecedented way. As the name suggests, the novel coronavirus, widely known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging human pathogen. A novel disease of relatively unknown origin, COVID-19 does not seem to be amenable to the currently available medicines since there is no specific cure for the disease. In the absence of any vaccine or effective antiviral medication, we have no tools at our disposal, but the method of quarantine, be it domestic or institutional, to hinder any further progression of this outbreak. However, there is a record of physicians in the past who practiced convalescent blood transfusion. To their awe, the method seemed to be useful. It is anticipated that these contemporary methods will outdo any other vaccination process in the time being, as blood transfusion is instead a cost-effective and time-friendly technique. Following a successful trial, this new approach of contemporary nature to a viral disease may serve as an emergency intervention to intercept infectious outbreaks and prevent an impending epidemic/pandemic. In this review, we document the most recent evidence regarding the efficiency of convalescent plasma and serum therapy on SARS, MERS, and particularly COVID-19, while discussing potential advantages and possible risks of such practice.","output":"Convalescent Blood: Current Perspective on the Efficacy of a Legacy Approach in COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is spreading around the world.

DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 25 May, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of different renal replacement therapy modalities in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. STUDY SELECTION: Ten reviewers (working in pairs) independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION: We performed random-effects frequentist network meta-analyses and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess certainty of evidence. The primary analysis was a four-node analysis: continuous renal replacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. The secondary analysis subdivided these four nodes into nine nodes including continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, continuous arterio-venous hemodiafiltration, intermittent hemodialysis, intermittent hemodialysis with hemofiltration, slow efficiency extended dialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis with hemofiltration, and peritoneal dialysis. We set the minimal important difference threshold for mortality as 2.5% (relative difference, 0.04). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty randomized controlled trials (n = 3,774 patients) proved eligible. There may be no difference in mortality between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93C1.18; low certainty), whereas continuous renal replacement therapy demonstrated a possible increase in mortality compared with slow efficiency extended dialysis (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85C1.33; low certainty) and peritoneal dialysis (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92C1.49; low certainty). Continuous renal replacement therapy may increase renal recovery compared with intermittent hemodialysis (relative risk, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.91C1.45; low certainty), whereas both continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis may be worse for renal recovery compared with slow efficiency extended dialysis and peritoneal dialysis (low certainty). Peritoneal dialysis was probably associated with the shortest duration of renal support and length of ICU stay compared with other interventions (low certainty for most comparisons). Slow efficiency extended dialysis may be associated with shortest length of hospital stay (low or moderate certainty for all comparisons) and days of mechanical ventilation (low certainty for all comparisons) compared with other interventions. There was no difference between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis in terms of hypotension (relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.72C1.16; moderate certainty) or other complications of therapy, but an increased risk of hypotension and bleeding was seen with both modalities compared with peritoneal dialysis (low or moderate certainty). Complications of slow efficiency extended dialysis were not sufficiently reported to inform comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this network meta-analysis suggest there is no difference in mortality between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis although continuous renal replacement therapy may increases renal recovery compared with intermittent hemodialysis. Slow efficiency extended dialysis with hemofiltration may be the most effective intervention at reducing mortality. Peritoneal dialysis is associated with good efficacy, and the least number of complications however may not be practical in all settings. Importantly, all conclusions are based on very low to moderate certainty evidence, limited by imprecision. At the very least, ICU clinicians should feel comfortable that the differences between continuous renal replacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis, and, where clinically appropriate, peritoneal dialysis are likely small, and any of these modalities is a reasonable option to employ in critically ill patients.","output":"Comparing Renal Replacement Therapy Modalities in Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distance learning demand has increased and turned into an obligatory educational system during the COVID-19 Pandemic Within this period, students need exceptional support and assistance to be adjusted to the Online framework environment The current study investigates distance learning on chemical engineering students' educational performance during this pandemic period This study addresses many issues related to distance learning, such as the household setting suitability with the internet connections, Online lecture activities, Online classroom experience and assessment tools, and student's perception of the Online graduation projects A comprehensive survey was organized and structured to observe and evaluate these associated issues to distance learning The study targeted the third, fourth, and fifth-year students The responses of the students revealed positive and negative assessments of the Online teaching during this Pandemic Generally, the participated students did not experience significant technical obstacles to acquiring all the Online activities Most of the contributed students expressed some difficulties concentrating during the Online sessions with limited student-instructor interactions Graduation Project students encountered problems in performing technical discussions with their academic advisors, coordinators, and teammates compared to the face-to-face approach ? 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","output":"Challenges, benefits & drawbacks of chemical engineering on-line teaching during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease is defined as complex interaction of 3 things: disease-causing agent, host and environment The government, CDC and hospital administrations have had reasonable success with the effects of social distancing and coronavirus testing;kudos to them That addresses 1 of the 3 main factors of a disease;i e disease -causing agent However, there are 2 other ingredients in the complex of a disease;i e the host of the disease and finally the environment of the disease We are the hosts and it is time we take ownership of this ourselves and join the effort with the government towards understanding the dysregulated immune response seen in severe covid-19 and enable the public in strengthening the inner environment and the host immune response Social distancing can be complete only when the host is prepared to fight the war in the coming fall and winter seasons The outer environment seems to spontaneously recharging itself as a consequence of social distancing","output":"Leading From Darkness to Light: Understanding Chronic Disease and Coronavirus: An Integrative Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modelers published thoughtful articles after the 2003 SARS crisis, but had limited if any real-time impact on the global response and may even have inadvertently contributed to a lingering misunderstanding of the means by which the epidemic was controlled.

Nonetheless, in exploring the possible impact of quarantine, the product of efficiency and efficacy was varied over the entire unit interval. Another mistake was repeatedly fitting otherwise appropriate gamma distributions to times to event regardless of whether they were stationary or not, particularly onset-isolation intervals whose progressive reduction evidently contributed to SARS control.

OBJECTIVE: Complement hyperactivation promotes lung injury and was observed in patients suffering from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we investigated the very first interactions of primary human airway epithelial cells on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of complement component 3 (C3)-mediated effects. METHODS: For this, we used highly differentiated primary human 3-dimensional tissue models infected with SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates. On infection, viral load, viral infectivity, intracellular complement activation, inflammatory mechanisms, and tissue destruction were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, high content screening, plaque assays, luminex analyses, and transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. RESULTS: Here, we show that primary normal human bronchial and small airway epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by an inflated local C3 mobilization. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation and destruction of the epithelial integrity in monolayer cultures of primary human airway cells and highly differentiated, pseudostratified, mucus-producing, ciliated respiratory tissue models. SARS-CoV-2-infected 3-dimensional cultures secreted significantly higher levels of C3a and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-1&#945;, and RANTES.

However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-P, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-P replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-P in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-P expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-P incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication.","output":"In Vitro and In Vivo Attenuation of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) by Phosphoprotein Deletion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruption of 'normal' academic studies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was embodied mainly in a rapid transition from in-class teaching to online synchronous instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine the lecturer's emotions towards the change they experienced with the sudden shift to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of those emotions on their willingness to teach online in the future. In the present study, 239 academic lecturers answered an online questionnaire. Four groups of emotions were examined: Success, opportunity, failure, and threat. The findings indicated that the emotions lecturers experienced most strongly was that of success, followed by opportunity. The predictors of lecturer's willingness to teach online in the future were emotions related to 'opportunity' and 'failure'. Surprisingly, the dramatic event of COVID-19 lockdown evoked more positive than negative emotions among lecturers during the first semester of the crisis. The emotions of threat that might characterize this period did not affect the willingness to teach online in the future as may be expected. This study demonstrates how tracing the emotional response toward adopting technology may contribute to understanding technology acceptance. It also contributes to understanding the differences in experiencing change in the normal process of technology adoption as opposed to emergency times.","output":"In times of trouble: Higher education lecturers' emotional reaction to online instruction during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The ability of cells to take and change shape is a fundamental feature underlying development, wound repair, and tissue maintenance. Central to this process is physical and signaling interactions between the three cytoskeletal polymeric networks: F-actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Vimentin is an IF protein that is essential to the mechanical resilience of cells and regulates cross-talk among the cytoskeleton, but its role in how cells sense and respond to the surrounding extracellular matrix is largely unclear. To investigate vimentins role in substrate sensing, we designed polyacrylamide hydrogels that mimic the elastic and viscoelastic nature of in vivo tissues. Using wild-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we show that vimentin enhances cell spreading on viscoelastic substrates, even though it has little effect in the limit of purely elastic substrates.

Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Three validation cohorts were generated: 2 external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and 1 internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by reestimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N = 1477). RESULTS: The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.94, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope, 0.86, 0.94, and 0.79; intercept, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves. The updated model was also useful to predict fatal outcome in patients without respiratory distress at the time of evaluation.

However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects' overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40-49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20-29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease.

Methods: A semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard (PH) model has been used to explore the covariates that are associated with the number of days to reach the first and second peak of global COVID-19 cases. Results: As of January 18, 2021, the first and second peak were found in 175 and 59 countries, out of 188 countries, respectively. The median number of days to hit the first peak was 60 days for countries which have median age above 40 while the median number of days to hit the second peak was 267 days for countries which have population density above 500 per square kilometer. Countries having population density between 250 and 500 were 2.25 times more likely to experience the first peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.15-4.45, P<0.05) than countries which have population density below 25. Countries having population density between 100 and 250 were 67% less likely to get the second peak (95% CI: 0.119-0.908, P<0.05) compared to countries which have population density below 25. Countries having cardiovascular death rates above 350 were 2.94 times more likely to get the first peak (95% CI: 1.59-5.43, P<0.001). In contrast, countries having diabetes prevalence rate 3 to 12 were 85% less likely to experience the second peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 0.036-0.680, P<0.05) than countries which have diabetes prevalence rate below 3. Besides, highly significant difference is found in the Kaplan-Meier plots of the number of days to reach both peaks across different categories of the country's Human Development Index. Conclusions: The number of days to the first peak was considerably small in Asian & European countries but that to the second peak in the countries where diabetes prevalence was very higher. Country's life expectancy had a significant effect on determining the first peak and so was the case for two other variables--the cardiovascular death rate and hospital beds per thousand.

METHODS: The respondents were from 8 hospitals in 3 cities in Liaoning province, China. Data were collected and analyzed including the following sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) work situations; (3) ranking of six stressors; (4) job burnout scale; (5) effort-reward imbalance scale; (6) work violence scale; (7) fear of malpractice scale. A total of 1056 individuals became the study objects. A statistical analysis and hierarchical linear regression analysis were performed to explore the prevalence of burnout and the effects of stressors. RESULTS: The prevalence of job burnout was 20.5, and 72.9% of all respondents reported a least one symptom of burnout. The respondents who were male, 30C39 years old, had a masters degree or high and working hours > 60 h per week, came from obstetrics and gynecology or pediatrics profession prone to job burnout. The relationship with patients and work tasks are the top two ranking stressors in the subjective perception survey.

LncRNAs have been well characterized in many organisms, but their functions in insects have not been well deciphered. Advancement of high-throughput technologies has enabled the sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes of several insects, which has led to the identification of many important lncRNAs in insects. Characterization of lncRNAs and their regulatory roles in insects may provide insights of novel pest control strategies. Through this comprehensive review, we present an overview of insect lncRNAs, their identification as well as their function in insects of different orders. Toward the end of the review, we highlight the role of lncRNAs in insect developmental processes and discuss the future prospects of lncRNAs in insects. ABSTRACT: Only a small subset of all the transcribed RNAs are used as a template for protein translation, whereas RNA molecules that are not translated play a very important role as regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Besides traditionally known RNAs (ribosomal and transfer RNAs), ncRNAs also include small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNAs, which were initially thought to be junk, have gained a great deal attention because of their regulatory roles in diverse biological processes in animals and plants. Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals on this planet. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in almost all aspects of insect development, reproduction, and genetic plasticity. In this review, we describe the function and molecular mechanisms of the mode of action of different insect lncRNAs discovered up to date.","output":"Long Non-Coding RNAs in Insects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) lead to early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease in humans. In healthy neurons, full-length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post-translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra-mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA-modulated transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor-TRK?. Mechanistically, cPINK1-mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRK?. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.","output":"Cleaved PINK1 induces neuronal plasticity through PKA-mediated BDNF functional regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Repurposed povidone iodine (PVP-I) has been suggested as an effective adjuvant against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the changes in RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of severe acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genes with PVP-I intranasal and oral application. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A longitudinal (repeated measures) single-arm open-label interventional study was conducted for 200 samples of ten COVID-19 patients in South India. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Demographic and clinical information were collected. Intranasal application and oral gargle with 1% PVP-I solution was done four times a day for seven days. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were taken for RT-PCR test at hour-0, hour-2, hour-4 on Day-0, Day-3, Day-6, and hour-0 on Day-9. METHODS AND MATERIAL: STATA analysis software version 14.2 was used. McNemar Test was applied for paired samples. Skilling Mack Test was used to assess the association between PVP-I use (intra-day and inter-day) and E gene/N gene Ct values. Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used for further analyses. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age of the patients was 41.5 (8.82) years. A total of 100 pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were analysed. No significant difference was observed in the Ct values of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. E gene Ct values (nasopharyngeal) at Hour-0 increased from Day-0 to Day-9 (P = 0.005). Ct value was higher at Hour-2 for most of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: RT\\\\PCR results (qualitative) differed at various testing points in the same patients. Lower Ct values were found in the nasopharyngeal samples. Successive increase in E gene Ct values indicates reduced viral load with natural course of COVID-19. PVP-I may have an optimal impact within 2 h of usage.

COVID-19 led to behavioral changes aimed to control droplet transmission or contact transmission. In this study, we examined the incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 data were extracted from the national data based on the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Common infectious diseases were selected from notifiable infectious diseases under the NESID. The epidemic activity of the diseases during 2015C2020 was evaluated based on the Infectious Disease Weekly Reports published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Each disease was then categorized according to the route of transmission. Many Japanese people had adopted hygienic activities, such as wearing masks and hand washing, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the correlation between the time-series of disease counts of common infectious diseases and COVID-19 over time using cross-correlation analysis. The weekly number of cases of measles, rotavirus, and several infections transmitted by droplet spread, was negatively correlated with the weekly number of cases of COVID-19 for up to 20 weeks in the past. According to the difference-in-differences analysis, the activity of influenza and rubella was significantly lower starting from the second week in 2020 than that in 2015C2019. Only legionellosis was more frequent throughout the year than in 2015C2019. Lower activity was also observed in some contact transmitted, airborne-transmitted, and fecal-oral transmitted diseases. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, exanthema subitum, showed the same trend as that over the previous 5 years.

Interestingly, MV infection led to an increase of rpS6 protein levels and phosphorylation of eIF4E. Treatment with both inhibitors reduced the rpS6 protein expression, and in addition, SKI-II reduced rpS6 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of eIF4E was slightly reduced by both inhibitors. In addition, SKI-II led to reduced levels of IKK in MV-infected cells. Both inhibitors reduced the expression of viral proteins and the titers of newly synthesized MV by approximately one log step. As expected, SKI-II and rapamycin reduced also the virally encoded GFP expression; however, ceranib-2 astonishingly led to increased levels of GFP fluorescence. Our findings suggest that the inhibitors ceranib-2 and SKI-II act via differential mechanisms on MV replication. The observed effects on mTORC1 downstream signaling, predominantly the reduction of rpS6 levels by both inhibitors, may affect the translational capacity of the cells and contribute to the antiviral effect in human primary PBL.","output":"The Sphingolipid Inhibitors Ceranib-2 and SKI-II Reduce Measles Virus Replication in Primary Human Lymphocytes: Effects on mTORC1 Downstream Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model Our measurement of the contact rate is constructed using data on actively infected, recovered and deceased cases We propose a new trend filtering method that is a variant of the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, constrained by the number of possible kinks We term it the sparse HP filter and apply it to daily data from five countries: Canada, China, South Korea, the UK and the US Our new method yields the kinks that are well aligned with actual events in each country We find that the sparse HP filter provides a fewer kinks than the l1 trend filter, while both methods fitting data equally well Theoretically, we establish risk consistency of both the sparse HP and l1 trend filters Ultimately, we propose to use time-varying contact growth rates to document and monitor outbreaks of COVID-19","output":"Sparse HP filter: finding kinks in the COVID-19 contact rate.

SARS-CoV-2 is typically collected by nasopharyngeal swab and detected by PCR; however, patients can test positive for 3 months after infection. Without the ability to assay SARS-CoV-2 in human breath, it is not possible to learn the transmission risk from infected individuals. To detect virus in breath, the Bubbler - a breathalyzer that reverse transcribes RNA from airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles into a sample-specific barcoded cDNA was developed. Tests of the Bubbler on 70 patients admitted to Rhode Island Hospital showed that it was both more predictive of lower respiratory track involvement (i.e. abnormal chest X-rays) and less invasive than alternatives. In addition, the Bubbler sample of exhaled air was 3 times more enriched for SARS-CoV-2 RNA than tongue swabs implying viral particles were being directly sampled. The demonstration of how barcode-enabled Bubblers can simultaneously diagnose large batches of pooled samples at a detection limit of 334 genomic copies/sample was given. Diagnosis by sequencing can provide additional information such as viral load and strain identity. Finally, the Bubbler was configured to sample nucleic acids in water droplets circulating in air, demonstrating this devices potential for environmental monitoring and the protective effect of adequate ventilation.","output":"Efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 from exhaled breath."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus never identified before in humans.

In this paper, with the aim of providing a fully automatic and faster diagnosis, we propose the adoption of deep learning for COVID-19 detection from X-rays. Method: In particular, we propose an approach composed by three phases: the first one to detect if in a chest X-ray there is the presence of a pneumonia. The second one to discern between COVID-19 and pneumonia. The last step is aimed to localise the areas in the X-ray symptomatic of the COVID-19 presence.

We also consider pooled testing, a method of grouping samples to conserve tests. When pooled testing is an option, it may be optimal to test two groups of individuals: those who are very likely to be infected and those who are very unlikely to be infected.

However, the exact interplay between HT, shoulder range of motion (ROM), competition level differences, and injury risk is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between HT, ROM, and injury risk in baseball players. Secondarily, to determine HT based on competition level. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until November 4, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) HT measurements and (2) arm injury or shoulder ROM. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 3. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers recorded patient demographics, competition level, HT, shoulder ROM, and injury data. RESULTS A total of 32 studies were included. There was no difference between baseball players with shoulder and elbow injuries and noninjured players (side-to-side HT difference: mean difference [MD], 1.75 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]; dominant arm: MD, 0.17 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]). Meta-regression determined that for every 1 increase in shoulder internal rotation (IR), there was a subsequent increase of 0.65 in HT (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.02). HT did not explain external rotation (ER ROM: 0.19 [95% CI, -0.24 to 0.61]) or horizontal adduction (HA ROM: 0.18 [95% CI, -0.46 to 0.82]). There were no differences between HT at the high school, college, or professional levels. CONCLUSION No relationship was found between HT and injury risk. However, HT explained 65% of IR ROM but did not explain ER ROM or HA ROM. There were no differences in HT pertaining to competition level. The majority of IR may be nonmodifiable. Treatment to restore and maintain clinical IR may be important, especially in players with naturally greater torsion.

Whilst a number of recent reports suggest that COVID-19 associated stroke tends to be severe, there is limited data on the effects of COVID-19 in prospective registries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine how COVID-19 infection may affect cerebrovascular disease, we evaluated the ischemic stroke sub-types, clinical course and outcomes prior to and during the pandemic in Qatar. The Hamad General Hospital (HGH) stroke database was interrogated for stroke admissions during the last 4 months of 2019 and January-May 2020. RESULTS: In Qatar the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from only 2 in February to 779 in March, 12,628 in April and 45,501 in May. Stroke admissions to HGH declined marginally from an average of 97/month for six pre-COVID months to 72/month in March-May. There were 32 strokes that were positive for COVID-19. When compared to non-COVID-19 stroke during the three months of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients were younger with significantly lower rates of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Information regarding cardiac markers for precise risk-stratification is limited. We aim to discover sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarkers for optimizing management and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 2954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment from the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China from February 4 to April 10 were included in this retrospective cohort. Serum levels of cardiac markers were collected after admission. Coronary artery disease diagnosis and survival status were recorded. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing from different cohorts of non-COVID-19 were performed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. RESULTS: Among 2954 COVID-19 patients in the analysis, the median age was 60 years (50C68 years), 1461 (49.5%) were female, and 1515 (51.3%) were severe/critical. Compared to mild/moderate (1439, 48.7%) patients, severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of BNP (42 [24.6%] vs 7 [1.1%]), hs-TNI (38 [48.1%] vs 6 [1.0%]), - HBDH (55 [10.4%] vs 2 [0.2%]), CK-MB (45 [36.3%] vs 12 [0.9%]), and LDH (56 [12.5%] vs 1 [0.1%]) had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to patients with normal levels. The same trend was observed in the ICU admission rate. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of BNP (52 [46.5%] vs 119 [16.5%]), hs-TNI (24 [26.7%] vs 9.6 [%], - HBDH (86 [55.5%] vs 443 [34.4%]), CK-MB (27 [17.4%] vs 97 [7.5%]), and LDH (65 [41.9%] vs 382 [29.7%]), when compared with those without coronary artery disease. There was enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls.

No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules.

Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication.

RESULTS: Most patients want frank information from their physicians about their condition at all times over the course of their treatment, from the moment of diagnosis to the end of their life. This has no lasting adverse effects, but rather enables patients to take decisions that are appropriate to their stage of disease. Early integration in palliative care can improve patients' quality of life, symptom control, and mood.

For community-based studies, home-based specimen collection by parents could be a resource-saving alternative to collection by healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we compared parent and HCW groups for their likelihood to collect specimens and the timeliness and quality of such collection. METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, parents from Brisbane, Australia, were taught to identify new ARI episodes in their children aged <2 years. When their child had a new ARI, parents either collected a nasal swab from the child (P group) or contacted an HCW who visited to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab (HCW group). We compared the likelihood and timeliness of specimen collection and respiratory pathogen detection. A nested diagnostic study compared paired specimen collections from children in the HCW group. RESULTS: Included were 76 incident ARI episodes from 31 children and 102 episodes from 33 children in the P and HCW groups, respectively. The proportions of ARIs for which a specimen was collected were similar (P group, 69.7%; HCW group, 72.5%; P = .77), and pathogens were detected in 93.8% and 77.5% of the specimens, respectively (P = .03). The period between ARI onset and specimen collection was shorter in the P group than in the HCW group (mean difference, 1.9 days [95% confidence interval, 0.7C3.0 days]; P < .001). For the 69 paired specimens, viral loads were lower in the parent-collected swabs (mean cycle threshold difference, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 3.1C5.9]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and HCWs obtained samples in similar proportions of ARI episodes, but the parents collected the samples fewer days after ARI onset and with a resulting higher likelihood of pathogen identification. This method can be used in population-based epidemiological studies of ARI as a resource-saving alternative.

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in at least 1 published systematic review comparing the use of masks with a control group, either in community or health care settings, on the risk of viral respiratory infections. SYNTHESIS In total, 11 systematic reviews were included and 18 RCTs of 26 444 participants were found, 12 in the community and 6 in health care workers. Included studies had limitations and were deemed at high risk of bias. Overall, the use of masks in the community did not reduce the risk of influenza, confirmed viral respiratory infection, influenzalike illness, or any clinical respiratory infection. However, in the 2 trials that most closely aligned with mask use in real-life community settings, there was a significant risk reduction in influenzalike illness (risk ratio [RR] = 0.83; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). The use of masks in households with a sick contact was not associated with a significant infection risk reduction in any analysis, no matter if masks were used by the sick individual, the healthy family members, or both. In health care workers, surgical masks were superior to cloth masks for preventing influenzalike illness (RR = 0.12; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98), and N95 masks were likely superior to surgical masks for preventing influenzalike illness (RR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00) and any clinical respiratory infections (RR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00). CONCLUSION This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections. In the community setting, a possible reduced risk of influenzalike illness was found among mask users. In health care workers, the results show no difference between N95 masks and surgical masks on the risk of confirmed influenza or other confirmed viral respiratory infections, although possible benefits from N95 masks were found for preventing influenzalike illness or other clinical respiratory infections. Surgical masks might be superior to cloth masks but data are limited to 1 trial.","output":"Masks for prevention of viral respiratory infections among health care workers and the public: PEER umbrella systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Diastolic dysfunction has been reported in patients with COVID-19. Due to the role of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure, this study investigated the relationship between serum NT-proBNP levels and diastolic heart failure in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : This descriptive-analytical study was performed at Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital in Babol. Fifty-four patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to the ICU were included in the study. The primary outcome was the relationship and predictive role of NT-proBNP and diastolic heart failure in patients with severe SARS-COV-2 infection. Patients with pro BNP >125 pg/mL underwent echocardiography and the relationship between echocardiographic indices and NT-proBNP was assessed as a secondary outcome. Results: : Our study showed that plasma NT-proBNP levels in patients with increased diastolic dysfunction were associated with disease severity. It was also found that the cut-off point of NT-proBNP = 799 pg/mL could be a predictor of diastolic dysfunction grades two and three. In this study, patients with a serum NT-proBNP level equal or above 799 had 37 times higher chance of having diastolic dysfunction than those with a serum NT-proBNP level below 799. Patients with NT-proBNP above 556 had RV_EA> 2 in echocardiography, indicating increased right-sided filling pressures. Conclusion: Despite the confounding factors in the interpretation of the pro BNP level in COVID-19, its level can be used to estimate the presence of high-grade diastolic heart failure on the left and right sides of the heart and the presence of high filling pressures. Lower levels of NT-proBNP are associated with right-sided diastolic failure.","output":"The Relationship Between Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) Levels and Diastolic Heart Failure in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is one of the most useful preventive interventions in healthcare.

Telemedicine enables provision of care when in-person visits are not possible. Sheba Medical Center made a rapid transition of outpatient clinics to video consultations (VC) during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. Reported are results of a survey of patient and clinician user experience with VC. METHODS: Satisfaction surveys were sent by text messages to patients, clinicians who practice VC (users) and clinicians who do not practice VC (non-users). Questions referred to general satisfaction, ease of use, technical issues and medical and communication quality. Questions and scales were based on Sheba's clinics patient experience surveys, outpatient clinics. RESULTS: More than 1200 clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, social workers, dietitians, speech therapists, genetic consultants and others) provided VC during the study period. Five hundred forty patients, 162 clinicians who were users and 50 clinicians who were non-users completed the survey. High level of satisfaction was reported by 89.8% of patients and 37.7% of clinician users. Technical problems were experienced by 21% of patients and 80% of clinician users. Almost 70% of patients but only 23.5% of clinicians found the platform very simple to use. Over 90% of patients were very satisfied with clinician's courtesy, expressed a high sense of trust, thought that clinician's explanations and recommendations were clear and estimated that the clinician understood their problems and 86.5% of them would recommend VC to family and friends.Eighty seven percent of clinician users recognize the benefit of VC for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic but only 68% supported continuation of the service after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study reports on high levels of patient satisfaction from outpatient clinics VC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower levels of clinician satisfaction can mostly be attributed to technical and administrative challenges related to the newly implemented telemedicine platform. Our findings support the continued future use of VC as a means of providing patient centered care.

Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae. Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.

Though only a small percentage of infected individuals reach the critical stage of the disease, i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), this percentage represents a significant number of patients that can overwhelm the healthcare system. Patients presenting with ARDS need mechanical ventilation, as their lungs are unable to oxygenate blood on their own due to fluid accumulation. One way to manage this excess pressure of fluid build-up around the lung tissues is to relieve the dorsal alveoli by prompting the patient to lie face down on the stomach; this is called awake proning. It is a procedure that is directed towards the recruitment of lung parenchyma when infected with pneumonia or when the condition has worsened into ARDS. This helps in relieving the pressure from the dorsal lung surface that has markedly higher perfusion than the ventral surface. Awake proning delays the use of mechanical ventilation and facilitates the patients with severe ARDS or severe pneumonia in maintaining the supply of oxygen to the body tissues. Since medical institutes are overburdened and limited ventilators are available, awake proning can reduce not only the burden on hospitals but also decrease the need for ventilators.","output":"Awake Proning: A Necessary Evil During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of different acupuncture manipulations on Deqi sensations and surface myoelectricity, and explore the correlation between Deqi sensations and needling manipulations. METHODS Forty-five healthy participants accepted twirling, lifting-thrusting, and twirling plus lifting-thrusting manipulanions at right Zusanli (ST 36), respectively. The acupuncturist's and participants' Deqi sensations were collected by MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS). The intensity and occurrence rate of soreness, dull pain, pressure, heaviness, fullness, numbness, sharp pain, warmth, coolness, and throbbing feelings of participants, and tightness, smooth, and tangle feelings of acupuncturist were measured. The correlation between the acupuncturist's and participant's Deqi sensations was analyzed. Surface electromyogram (EMG) were recorded before, during and after needling in 30 participants. The integrated EMG (iEMG), mean power frequency (MPF) and media frequency (MF) were analyzed. RESULT Both fullness and soreness of participants and tightness of acupuncturist were the most frequently occurred ones. A positive correlation between participants' fullness and acupuncturist's tightness was observed during the three aforementioned needling manipulations (P<0.05, OR>1). Almost all the needling sensations measured in the present study could be induced by the three needling manipulations. However, strength of Deqi sensations was exhibited as lifting-thrusting > twirling plus lifting-thrusting > twirling according to MASS index.

According to the D-AMY change, we divided patients into five patterns and defined delayed PF cases. We analyzed clinical characteristics, including serum amylase and D-AMY, and examined the correlation between the period of drain insertion and PF grade. In 15 delayed PF cases, 12 cases were grade B or C, pancreatic cancer was less frequent, pancreatic ducts were smaller, and soft pancreas texture was more commonly observed. The D-AMY on postoperative day (POD) 1 was higher in cases of delayed PF compared with non-PF cases (P < 0.0001). In 28 cases with drain removal before POD 7, grade B or C PF was not observed afterward. The average D-AMY on POD 1 in cases with drain removal before POD 1 was significantly lower than in delayed PF cases. Although further studies are required to determine the most appropriate timing of drain removal, it is thought that intra-abdominal drains should be removed within seven days of PD in cases without signs of PF.

METHODS: A rapid review was conducted based on a search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PyscINFO, Global Health, epistemonikos.org, covid19reviews.org, and eppi.ioe.ac.uk/covid19_map_v13.html. Eligible studies include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies published between 1/1/2000 and 28/05/2020 and that examined the impact of various activities on mental health outcomes in low-resource settings and contexts that lead to social isolation. Studies of activities that require mental health professionals or that could not be done at home were excluded. Two review authors performed title/abstract screening. At the full-text review stage, 25% of the potentially eligible studies were reviewed in full by two review authors; the rest were reviewed by one review author. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by one review author and checked by a second review author. The main outcome assessed was change or differences in mental health as expressed in Cohen's d; analysis was conducted following the synthesis without meta-analysis guidelines (SWiM). PROSPERO registration: CRD42020186082. RESULTS: Of 1,236 unique records identified, 160 were reviewed in full, resulting in 16 included studies. The included studies reported on the beneficial effects of exercise, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and listening to relaxing music. One study reported on the association between solitary religious activities and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. While most of the included studies examined activities in group settings, particularly among individuals in prisons, the activities were described as something that can be performed at home and alone. All included studies were assessed to be at risk of bias in one or more of the bias domains examined. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that certain home-based activities can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines are needed to help optimize benefits while minimizing potential risks when performing these activities.","output":"A rapid review of home-based activities that can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The remed System Pivotal Trial was a prospective, multi-center, randomized trial demonstrating transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (TPNS) therapy is safe and effectively treats central sleep apnea (CSA) and improves sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness Subsequently, the remed System was approved by FDA in 2017 As a condition of approval, the Post Approval Study (PAS) collected clinical evidence regarding long-term safety and effectiveness in adults with moderate to severe CSA through five years post implant Methods: Patients remaining in the Pivotal Trial at the time of FDA approval were invited to enroll in the PAS and consented to undergo sleep studies (scored by a central laboratory), complete the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire to assess daytime sleepiness, and safety assessment All subjects (treatment and former control group) receiving active therapy were pooled;data from both trials were combined for analysis Results: Fifty-three of the original 151 Pivotal Trial patients consented to participate in the PAS and 52 completed the 5-year visit Following TPNS therapy, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), central-apnea index (CAI), arousal index, oxygen desaturation index, and sleep architecture showed sustained improvements Comparing 5 years to baseline, AHI and CAI decreased significantly (AHI baseline median 46 events/hour vs 17 at 5 years;CAI baseline median 23 events/hour vs 1 at 5 years), though residual hypopneas were present In parallel, the arousal index, oxygen desaturation index and sleep architecture improved The ESS improved by a statistically significant median reduction of 3 points at 5 years Serious adverse events related to implant procedure, device or delivered therapy were reported by 14% of patients which include 16 (9%) patients who underwent a pulse generator reposition or lead revision (primarily in the first year) None of the events caused long-term harm No unanticipated adverse device effects or related deaths occurred through 5 years Conclusion: Long-term TPNS safely improves CSA, sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness through 5 years post implant Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials gov Identifier: NCT01816776","output":"Transvenous Phrenic Nerve Stimulation for Treatment of Central Sleep Apnea: Five-Year Safety and Efficacy Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, analysis of changes of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein during pandemic is reported. ORF3a, a conserved coronavirus protein, is involved in virus replication and release. A set of 70,752 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID databank at the end of August 2020 have been scanned. All ORF3a mutations in the virus genomes were grouped according to the collection date interval and over the entire data set. The considered intervals were: start of collection-February, March, April, May, June, July and August 2020. The top five most frequent variants were examined within each collection interval. Overall, seventeen variants have been isolated. Ten of the seventeen mutant sites occur within the transmembrane (TM) domain of ORF3a and are in contact with the central pore or side tunnels. The other variant sites are in different places of the ORF3a structure. Within the entire sample, the five most frequent mutations are V13L, Q57H, Q57H + A99V, G196V and G252V. The same analysis identified 28 sites identically conserved in all the genome isolates. These sites are possibly involved in stabilization of monomer, dimer, tetramerization and interaction with other cellular components.

Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures.

Under Neutral theory, the amount of relevant and irrelevant indicators selected to operationalise the construct contribute equally to the accuracy of the observation. The Neutral or accurate observation is achieved by observing all relevant indicators only. Generic QoL instruments such as EQ-5D are increasingly being accepted as imprecise, especially in rare diseases, based on the relevance of their indicators. QoL is a construct that embodies a patient's subjectivity, individuality, and local circumstances at measurement. SEIQoL-DW is an instrument designed to respect these characteristics of QoL through eliciting indicators or cues directly from the subject along with the proportion of the overall QoL they contribute. EQ-5D and SEIQoL can therefore be considered as being at opposing ends of accuracy in QoL measurement. XLH is a hereditary, progressive, rare disease characterised by phosphate wasting, affecting both children and adults and impacting their QoL. The purpose of this study was to observe if any change in QoL of adult XLH patients were detectable using EQ-5D, SEIQoL eliciting new cues at each visit, and SEIQoL administering baseline cues overall visits (thereby silencing its time-dependency) versus baseline over 12 months. In addition, any association between the three sets of observations was explored. RESULTS: All quality of life scores were observed to decrease from baseline by 13.36%, 7.32% and 2.7% based on SEIQoL(visit_cues), SEIQoL(baseline_cues), and EQ-5D assessments, respectively. The decrease in the quality of life scores was only statistically significant (p = 0.037) for SEIQoL(visit_cues). Beyond the baseline visit, the only highly positive and statistically significant pairwise association was between SEIQoL(visit_cues) and SEIQoL(baseline_cues) at M6 ( = 0.782, P value < 0.05) and M9 ( = 0.879, P value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D and SEIQoL(baseline_cues) failed to detect the same statistically significant decrease in QoL observed by SEIQoL(visit_cues). Both sets of SEIQoL observations were more closely associated with each other than with EQ-5D. Observing constructs such as QoL in rare diseases benefit from a Neutrality in indicator selection and respecting variation in dominance of various indicators over time.","output":"Concordance between the schedule for the evaluation of individual quality of life-direct weighting (SEIQoL-DW) and the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) measures of quality of life outcomes in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Current Development Essay discusses the international legal implications of constitutional amendments adopted in the Russian Federation by an all-Russian vote, a quasi-referendum from June 25 to July 1, 2020 The most important of these amendments gives the Russian Constitution priority over decisions made by international courts and treaty bodies The amendments also address Russia's state succession to the Soviet Union Another provision protects Russia's territorial integrity The Essay discusses the background to these amendments, their content, and their significance for international law","output":"International Law and the 2020 Amendments to the Russian Constitution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study analysed the spatial distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over India during the COVID-19 lockdown phase -1 (March 25 to April 15, 2020) using MODIS Terra (MOD04) AOD data (550 nm) during 2001C2020.

In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist's crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals' choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","output":"The role of community pharmacists in increasing access and use of self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: examples from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy, all the hospital facilities had to reform their daily activities.

Design: descriptive study. Setting: Germany. Population: Patients with reported cerebrovascular events within the first month after a COVID-19 vaccine administration. Methods: We designed web-based questionnaire, which was e-mailed to all Departments of Neurology of University and non-university hospitals in Germany on April 6, 2021. Data collection was closed at midnight on April 14, 2021. We asked to report cases of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke and haemorrhage within one month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Incidence rates of cerebral events and CVT within one month from first vaccine shot administration was calculated by using official statistics of 9 German States. Results: A total of 62 cases were detected, of whom 45 had CVT, 9 primary ischemic stroke, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 4 other events. Eleven patients of 60 (18.3%) had a fatal outcome. Mean age was 46.7 years (48 patients <60 years, 77.4%), 75.8% of patients were female. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%). No events were reported after mRNA-1273 vaccination. The overall incidence rate of CVT within one month from first dose administration was 6.5 (95% CI, 4.4 to 9.2) per 100,000 person-years and 8.8 (95% CI, 6.4 to 11.9) for any included cerebrovascular event. The one-month incidence rate of CVT was higher among ChAdOx1 vaccinated persons (17.9, 95% CI, 11.8 to 26.1). The incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (3.46 to 34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (1.22 to 10.65) for women compared to non-women after adjusting for age group. In 26/45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable, in 19/45 patients (42.2%) the association was less likely. A high-grade probability was not confined to CVT but also occurred in 5/9 patients (55.6%) with primary ischemic stroke and 2/4 patients (50%) with ICH following vaccination.

Methods: We reviewed and compiled the responses to our questions on Twitter regarding the management and safety of deferred treatment in the setting of COVID\\\\19 related constraints on non\\\\urgent care. We chronicled the guidance published on this subject by various health authorities and professional organizations. Further, we analyzed peerreviewed literature on the safety of deferred treatment (surgery or systemic therapy) to make made evidence\\\\based recommendations. Results: Due to the rapidly changing information about epidemiology and infectious characteristics of COVID\\\\19, the health authorities and professional societies guidance required frequent revisions which by design take days or weeks to produce. Several active discussions on Twitter provided real\\\\time updates on the changing landscape of the restrictions being placed on non\\\\urgent care. For separate discussion threads on prostate cancer and bladder cancer, dozens of specialists with expertise in treating urologic cancers could be engaged in providing their expert opinions as well as share evidence to support their recommendations. Our analysis of published studies addressing the safety and extent to which delayed cancer care does not compromise oncological outcome revealed that most prostate cancer care and certain aspects of the bladder and kidney cancer care can be safely deferred for 2\\\\6 months. Urothelial bladder cancer and advanced kidney cancer require a higher priority for timely surgical care. We did not find evidence to support the idea of using nonsurgical therapies, such as hormone therapy for prostate cancer or chemotherapy for bladder cancer for safer deferment of previously planned surgery. We noted that the comments and recommendations made by the participants in the Twitter discussions were generally consistent with our evidence\\\\based recommendations for safely postponing cancer care for certain types of urologic cancers. Conclusion: The use of social media platforms, such as Twitter, where the comments and recommendations are subject to review and critique by other specialists is not only feasible but quite useful in addressing the situations requiring urgent resolution, often supported by published evidence. In circumstances such as natural disasters, this may be a preferable approach than the traditional expert panels due to its ability to harness the collective intellect to available experts to provide responses and solutions in real\\\\time. These real\\\\time communications via Twitter provided sound guidance which was readily available to the public and participants, and was generally in concordance with the peerreviewed data on safety of deferred treatment.","output":"Genitourinary cancer management during a severe pandemic: Utility of rapid communication tools and evidence\\\\based guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are intensely scrutinized for biomedical applications due to their excellent biocompatibility and adjustable magnetic field (MF) responsiveness. Three-dimensional spheroid culture of ADSC improves stem cell proliferation and differentiation, increasing their potential for clinical applications. In this study we aimed to detect if MF levitated culture of ADSC loaded with proprietary MNP maintain the properties of ADSC and improve their performances. Levitated ADSC-MNP formed aggregates with increased volume and reduced number compared to nonlevitated ones. ADSC-MNP from levitated spheroid displayed higher viability, proliferation and mobility compared to nonlevitated and 2D culture. Levitated and nonlevitated ADSC-MNP spheroids underwent three lineage differentiation, demonstrating preserved ADSC stemness. Quantitative osteogenesis showed similar values in MNP-loaded levitated and nonlevitated spheroids. Significant increases in adipogenic conversion was observed for all 3D formulation. Chondrogenic conversion in levitated and nonlevitated spheroids produced comparable ratio glucosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA. Increased chondrogenesis could be observed for ADSC-MNP in both levitated and nonlevitated condition. Taken together, ADSC-MNP levitated spheroids retain stemness and display superior cell viability and migratory capabilities. Furthermore, the method consistently increases spheroid maneuverability, potentially facilitating large scale manufacturing and automation.

Humans are estimated to ingest tens of thousands to millions of MP particles annually, or on the order of several milligrams daily. Available information suggests that inhalation of indoor air and ingestion of drinking water bottled in plastic are the major sources of MP exposure. Little is known on the occurrence of MPs in human diet. Evidence is accumulating that feeding bottles and medical devices can contribute to MP exposure in newborns and infants. Biomonitoring studies of human stool, fetus, and placenta provide direct evidence of MP exposure in infants and children. MPs <20 m were reported to cross biological membranes. Although plastics were once perceived as inert materials, MP exposure in laboratory animals is linked to various forms of inflammation, immunological response, endocrine disruption, alteration of lipid and energy metabolism, and other disorders. Whereas exposure to MPs itself is a concern, MPs can also be sources of exposure to plastic additives and other toxicants. Exposure of human cell lines to MP additives such as phthalates, bisphenols, and organotins causes adverse effects through the activation of nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) , , and , and retinoid X receptor (RXR), leading to oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid hormone disruption, and altered adipogenesis and energy production. The size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and hydrophobicity of MPs influence their toxicity. Maternal transfer of MPs to the developing fetus has been demonstrated in exposed laboratory animals and through the analysis of human placenta. In laboratory animal studies, maternal exposure to MPs altered energy and lipid metabolism in offspring and subsequent generations. Moreover, concomitant with the global increase in plastics production, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in human populations has increased over the past five decades, and there is evidence to support the hypothesis that MPs and their additives are potential obesogens. Even though MP exposures are ubiquitous and toxic effects from such exposures are a concern, systematic studies on this topic remain urgently needed.","output":"A Review of Human Exposure to Microplastics and Insights Into Microplastics as Obesogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present xspells, a model-agnostic local approach for explaining the decisions of a black box model for sentiment classification of short texts.

During cancer development, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dominatingly support disease progression and resistance to therapy by promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression, thereby making TAMs a target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we started with evidence that TAMs are highly plastic and heterogeneous in phenotype and function in response to microenvironmental cues. We pointed out that efforts to tear off the heterogeneous camouflage in TAMs conduce to target de facto protumoral TAMs efficiently. In particular, several fate-mapping models suggest that most tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are generated from embryonic progenitors, and new paradigms uncover the ontogeny of TAMs. First, TAMs from embryonic modeling of TRMs and circulating monocytes have distinct transcriptional profiling and function, suggesting that the ontogeny of TAMs is responsible for the functional heterogeneity of TAMs, in addition to microenvironmental cues. Second, metabolic remodeling helps determine the mechanism of phenotypic and functional characteristics in TAMs, including metabolic bias from macrophages ontogeny in macrophages functional plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. Both models aim at dissecting the ontogeny-related metabolic regulation in the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in TAMs. We argue that gleaning from the single-cell transcriptomics on subclonal TAMs origins may help understand the classification of TAMs population in subclonal evolution and their distinct roles in tumor development.

A cross-sectional study was conducted from 7 to 29 April 2020 on 5423 students at eight universities across Vietnam, including five universities in the North, one university in the Center, two universities in the South. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data on participants' characteristics, health literacy, fear of COVID-19 using the FCoV-19S, and health-related behaviors. The results showed that seven items of the FCoV-19S strongly loaded on one component, explained 62.15% of the variance, with good item-scale convergent validity and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90). Higher health literacy was associated with lower FCoV-19S scores (coefficient, B, -0.06; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, -0.08, -0.04; p < 0.001). Older age or last academic years, being men, and being able to pay for medication were associated with lower FCoV-19S scores. Students with higher FCoV-19S scores more likely kept smoking (odds ratio, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.14; p < 0.001) or drinking alcohol (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; p < 0.001) at an unchanged or higher level during the pandemic, as compared to students with lower FCoV-19S scores. In conclusion, the FCoV-19S is valid and reliable in screening for fear of COVID-19. Health literacy was found to protect medical students from fear. Smoking and drinking appeared to have a negative impact on fear of COVID-19.

The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective population\\\\based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test during pregnancy to non\\\\infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to ensure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) symptoms. RESULTS: Among 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID\\\\19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.41C3.41) and being foreign born (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70C2.64). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID\\\\19 included obesity (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.00C7.51), smoking (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.58C13.90), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22C27 weeks: OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.16C12.29; GA 28C36 weeks: OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.60C14.12), and having asthma (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.39C14.79).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of these behaviors in China and Israel. We relied on the 3Cs model that has been used to predict the adoption of a specific preventive behavior (vaccinations) with the goal of testing its applicability to other preventive behaviors such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The model indicates that confidence in social institutions, complacency (fear of and assessments about the risk of becoming ill) and constraints (levels of self-efficacy and confidence in being able to engage in the behaviors) are predictors of adopting preventive behaviors. Data were collected in China and Israel through an online survey of the population (n = 1406). We used latent variables and structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses derived from the 3Cs model. The findings indicate that there are some differences in the types of preventive behaviors adopted in the two countries. In Israel, higher levels of confidence predicted the adoption of avoidant behaviors and more constraints predicted engaging in fewer avoidant behaviors. In China, more constraints also contributed to the adoption of fewer avoidant behaviors, but peoples level of confidence fully mediated this result.

During this time, there has been a rapid expansion of telemedicine and its implementation in various clinical specialties and settings. In this observational study we aim to examine the utility of telemedicine in a pediatric rheumatology clinic, for 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A review of outpatient pediatric rheumatology telemedicine encounters were conducted from AprilCJune 2020. Telemedicine visits (n = 75) were compared to patients seen in practice over the prior year in office-based visits (March 2019CMarch 2020) (n = 415). Patient characteristics, information on no-show visits, completed visits, new patient or follow-up status, and if new patients had received a visit within 2 weeks of calling to schedule an appointment were analyzed by chart review. An independent sample t-test and Chi Square statistic was used to determine statical significance between the two groups. A two-proportion z-test was used to compare visit metrics. RESULTS: The percentage of new patients utilizing telemedicine (60%) was lower and statistically significant compared to the percentage of new patient office visits (84%) the previous year (p < 0.0001). There was no change in no-show rate between groups and patient characteristics were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a statistically significant decrease in new patient visits during the pandemic with telemedicine-only appointments compared to in-office visits over the previous year. This suggests a possible hesitation to seek care during this time. However, there was no significant difference among patient characteristics between telemedicine visits during the pandemic and during in-office visits in the previous year. In our experience, patient visits were able to be conducted via telemedicine with a limited physical exam using caregivers help during the pandemic.

Free radical reactions have been implicated in the pathology of more than 50 human diseases. Radicals and other reactive oxygen species are formed constantly in the human body, both by deliberate synthesis (e.g. by activated phagocytes) and by chemical side- reactions. They are removed by enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress, occurring when antioxidant defences are inadequate, can damage lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. A few clinical conditions are caused by oxidative stress, but more often the stress results from the disease. Sometimes it then makes a significant contribution to the disease pathology, and sometimes it does not. Several antioxidants are available for therapeutic use. They include molecules naturally present in the body [superoxide dismutase (SOD), -tocopherol, glutathione and its precursors, ascorbic acid, adenosine, lactoferrin and carotenoids] as well as synthetic antioxidants [such as thiols, ebselen (PZ51), xanthine oxidase inhibitors, inhibitors of phagocyte function, iron ion chelators and probucol].

This study investigated the relationships between parental closeness, self-efficacy and suicidal ideation among adolescents in Malaysia. The mediation effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation was also examined. METHOD A total of 684 school-going adolescents aged 14-17 years old were recruited via multistage cluster sampling. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's correlation analysis. The mediation model was tested using SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes. RESULTS The results showed that mother closeness, father closeness and self-efficacy had significant negative correlation with suicidal ideation. Specifically, self-efficacy emerged as a partial mediator in the relation between mother closeness and suicidal ideation. Self-efficacy also fully mediated the relationship between father closeness and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS The findings implied that mother closeness had stronger correlation with adolescents' suicidal ideation compared to father closeness, while self-efficacy plays an important role in the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation. Prevention and intervention efforts by practitioners dealing with adolescents' mental health issues, specifically on suicidal ideation, should seriously consider providing them with skills to enhance mother-adolescent relationship and their self-efficacy.","output":"Self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation among Malaysian adolescents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To achieve minimum DNA input and tumor purity requirements for next-generation sequencing (NGS), pathologists visually estimate macrodissection and slide count decisions. Misestimation may cause tissue waste and increased laboratory costs. We developed an AI-augmented smart pathology review system (SmartPath) to empower pathologists with quantitative metrics for determining tissue extraction parameters. Using digitized H&E-stained FFPE slides as inputs, SmartPath segments tumors, extracts cell-based features, and suggests macrodissection areas. To predict DNA yield per slide, the extracted features are correlated with known DNA yields. Then, a pathologist-defined target yield divided by the predicted DNA yield/slide gives the number of slides to scrape. Following model development, an internal validation trial was conducted within the Tempus Labs molecular sequencing laboratory. We evaluated our system on 501 clinical colorectal cancer slides, where half received SmartPath-augmented review and half traditional pathologist review. The SmartPath cohort had 25% more DNA yields within a desired target range of 100-2000ng. The SmartPath system recommended fewer slides to scrape for large tissue sections, saving tissue in these cases. Conversely, SmartPath recommended more slides to scrape for samples with scant tissue sections, helping prevent costly re-extraction due to insufficient extraction yield. A statistical analysis was performed to measure the impact of covariates on the results, offering insights on how to improve future applications of SmartPath. Overall, the study demonstrated that AI-augmented histopathologic review using SmartPath could decrease tissue waste, sequencing time, and laboratory costs by optimizing DNA yields and tumor purity.","output":"AI-augmented histopathologic review using image analysis to optimize DNA yield and tumor purity from FFPE slides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes by STATs is a critical host defense mechanism against virus infection.

Despite encoding other inhibitors of IFN-induced signaling, a poxvirus mutant lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 ? crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a phosphotyrosine-independent mode of 018 binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1. Moreover, the STAT1-binding motif of 018 shows similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which, similar to 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor.

Currently, no specific prophylaxis or treatment is available for CoV infections. Therefore we investigated the virucidal and antiviral potential of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce?) against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoVs, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. METHODS: To evaluate the antiviral potential of the extract, we pre-treated virus particles and cells and evaluated remaining infectivity by limited dilution. Furthermore, we exposed cells to the extract after infection to further evaluate its potential as a prophylaxis and treatment against coronaviruses. We also determined the protective effect of Echinaforce? in re-constituted nasal epithelium. RESULTS: In the current study, we found that HCoV-229E was irreversibly inactivated when exposed to Echinaforce? at 3.2 g/ml IC(50). Pre-treatment of cell lines, however, did not inhibit infection with HCoV-229E and post-infection treatment had only a marginal effect on virus propagation at 50 g/ml. However, we did observe a protective effect in an organotypic respiratory cell culture system by exposing pre-treated respiratory epithelium to droplets of HCoV-229E, imitating a natural infection. The observed virucidal activity of Echinaforce? was not restricted to common cold coronaviruses, as both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoVs were inactivated at comparable concentrations. Finally, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was also inactivated upon treatment with 50g/ml Echinaforce?. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that Echinaforce? is virucidal against HCoV-229E, upon direct contact and in an organotypic cell culture model. Furthermore, MERS-CoV and both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were inactivated at similar concentrations of the extract. Therefore we hypothesize that Echinacea purpurea preparations, such as Echinaforce?, could be effective as prophylactic treatment for all CoVs due to their structural similarities.","output":"In vitro virucidal activity of Echinaforce?, an Echinacea purpurea preparation, against coronaviruses, including common cold coronavirus 229E and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the most leading causes of mortality across the globe are infectious diseases which have cost tremendous lives with the latest being coronavirus (COVID-19) that has become the most recent challenging issue.

METHODS Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody and its titer in 113 convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were followed up from February 19, 2020 to April 6, 2020. The basic characteristics and treatment factors of patients in the high titer group (antibody titer1?160, n=22) and the low titer group (antibody titer <1?160, n=91) were analyzed. The IgG antibody titer in the high titer group was continuously monitored and the trend of titer was analyzed. RESULTS The difference in the clinical type of COVID-19, onset time, first admission C-reactive protein, absolute value of lymphocyte, absolute value of CD19+CD3- lymphocytes, and the treatment of glucocorticoid were not statistically significant between the patients in the high titer group and the low titer group (all P>0.05).

Bariatric surgery reduces progression of CKD to ESKD, but the risk of perioperative complications remains a concern. Methods: The 24-month data spanning 2017-2018 were obtained from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database and analyzed. Surgical complications were assessed on the basis of the length of hospital stay, mortality, reoperation, readmission, surgical site infection (SSI), and worsening of kidney function during the first 30 days after surgery. Results: The 277,948 patients who had primary bariatric procedures were 4411.9 (mean  SD) years old, 79.6% were women, and 71.2% were White. Mean BMI was 45.77.6 kg/m2. Compared with patients with an eGFR90 ml/min per BSA, those with stage 5 CKD/ESKD were 1.91 times more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of a bariatric procedure (95% CI, 1.37 to 2.67; P<0.001). Similarly, length of hospital stay beyond 2 days was 2.05-fold (95% CI, 1.64 to 2.56; P<0.001) higher and risk of deep incisional SSI was 6.92-fold (95% CI, 1.62 to 29.52; P=0.009) higher for those with stage 5 CKD/ESKD. Risk of early postoperative mortality increased with declining preoperative eGFR, such that patients with stage 3b CKD were 3.27 (95% CI, 1.82 to 5.89; P<0.001) times more likely to die compared with those with normal kidney function. However, absolute mortality rates remained relatively low at 0.53% in those with stage 3b CKD. Furthermore, absolute mortality rates were <0.5% in those with stages 4 and 5 CKD, and these advanced CKD stages were not independently associated with an increased risk of early postoperative mortality. Conclusions: Increased severity of kidney disease was associated with increased complications after bariatric surgery. However, even for the population with advanced CKD, the absolute rates of postoperative complications were low. The mounting evidence for bariatric surgery as a renoprotective intervention in people with and without established kidney disease suggests that bariatric surgery should be considered a safe and effective option for patients with CKD.","output":"The Impact of CKD on Perioperative Risk and Mortality after Bariatric Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Galectin-1 (gal-1), an endogenous lectin secreted by a variety of cell types, has pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions, including regulation of lymphocyte survival and cytokine secretion in autoimmune, transplant disease, and parasitic infection models. However, the role of gal-1 in viral infections is unknown. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe, often fatal, febrile encephalitis. The primary targets of NiV are endothelial cells. NiV infection of endothelial cells results in cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation triggered by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins of NiV that bear glycan structures recognized by gal-1. In the present study, we report that NiV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion is blocked by gal-1. This inhibition is specific to the Paramyxoviridae family because gal-1 did not inhibit fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, including two retroviruses and a pox virus, but inhibited fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of the related Hendra virus and another paramyxovirus. The physiologic dimeric form of gal-1 is required for fusion inhibition because a monomeric gal-1 mutant had no inhibitory effect on cell fusion. gal-1 binds to specific N-glycans on NiV glycoproteins and aberrantly oligomerizes NiV-F and NiV-G, indicating a mechanism for fusion inhibition. gal-1 also increases dendritic cell production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, known to be protective in the setting of other viral diseases such as Ebola infections. Thus, gal-1 may have direct antiviral effects and may also augment the innate immune response against this emerging pathogen.","output":"Novel innate immune functions for galectin-1: galectin-1 inhibits cell fusion by Nipah virus envelope glycoproteins and augments dendritic cell secretion of proinflammatory cytokines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is one of the most prevalent viruses detected in laboratory mouse colonies.

The aim of this work is to analyse the medium-term consequences during the first 9 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in children with acute appendicitis (AA). Methods: A retrospective study was performed on children operated on for AA in our institution between 2017-2020, who were distributed in two groups according to the date of surgery: COVID-19 group (after March 9, 2020) and control group (before March 9, 2020).

Results: A total of 1274 patients were included (288 COVID group;986 control group), without demographic differences between them. Time from symptom onset was significantly longer in COVID-19 group patients (34.5 vs. 24.2 hours;p=0.021), although no differences in associated symptoms were observed between both groups.

An important target is the main protease (Mpro), which plays a major role in replication of the virus. In this study, Gaussian and residue network models are employed to reveal two distinct potential allosteric sites on Mpro that can be evaluated as drug targets besides the active site. Then, FDA-approved drugs are docked to three distinct sites with flexible docking using AutoDock Vina to identify potential drug candidates. 14 best molecule hits for the active site of Mpro are determined. 6 of these also exhibit high docking scores for the potential allosteric regions. Full-atom molecular dynamics simulations with MM-GBSA method indicate that compounds docked to active and potential allosteric sites form stable interactions with high binding free energy (?Gbind) values. ?Gbind values reach -52.06 kcal/mol for the active site, -51.08 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 1, and -42.93 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 2.

After the elimination of LAB strains with high cytotoxicity to Vero cells, the protective effects of the remaining 6 strains against PEDV infection were determined. Vero cells pretreated with the intracellular extracts or cell wall fractions of YM22 and YM33 strains for 24 h before infection with PEDV showed significantly higher cell viabilities and lower mRNA expression of PEDV nucleocapsid (PEDV-N) than the unpretreated cells, indicating that the intracellular extracts and cell wall fractions of YM22 and YM33 possessed prophylactic effects on Vero cells against PEDV infection. PEDV-infection significantly increased the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in Vero cells.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Desk research and interview method have been applied in this paper. The literature review concerned two areas, i.e., the analytical approach to management and the management of university educational processes. Unstructured interviews conducted with university authorities located in Poland were the second research method applied. Findings: Based on literature studies, conducted interviews and authors' personal experience, the original model of academic teachers' remote work evaluation that implements an analytical approach and utilises data mart concept and business intelligence tools has been created. This model contains the following elements, the conceptual model of data mart allowing the evaluation of courses realisation and teachers job, KPIs utilised in this evaluation, and the dashboard presenting KPI's values. Two main areas representing courses evaluation and teachers' evaluation have been considered. Practical Implications: The authors propose the solution that utilises an analytical approach to improve the management of the evaluation process of educational processes at the university. Created model may be a valuable source of inspiration for university authorities responsible for ensuring the high efficiency of these processes, and for people responsible for developing teachers' competencies.

We analyze the degree of housing deprivation faced by households in European countries when COVID-19 lockdown measures were enacted. To do so, we propose a synthetic measure that includes more dimensions than the official Eurostat indicator of severe housing deprivation. We use a fuzzy set approach to measure housing deprivation so that, unlike traditional deprivation approaches, based on a dichotomous variable, we can identify different degrees of housing deprivation for each household in the population. We find similar orderings of housing deprivation dimensions by country with the highest degree of deprivation in the living space dimension and the lowest one in the standard housing or technology deprivation dimension. Nonetheless, housing deprivation levels differ across countries, with Eastern European households being significantly more housing deprived than the rest when the lockdown began.

The study examined the mental health trajectories of a sample of employed adults in Hamilton, Ontario during the initial lockdown and after the re-opening following the first wave in Canada. Further, this study also identified the pandemic-related stressors and coping strategies associated with changes in depressive symptoms in employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The InHamilton COVID-19 longitudinal study involved 579 employees aged 22C88 years from a large public university in an urban area of Hamilton, Ontario at baseline (April 2020). Participants were followed monthly with 6 waves of data collected between April and November 2020. A growth mixture modeling approach was used to identify distinct groups of adults who followed a similar pattern of depressive symptoms over time and to describe the longitudinal change in the outcome within and among the identified sub-groups. RESULTS: Our results showed two distinct trajectories of change with 66.2% of participants displaying low-consistent patterns of depressive symptoms, and 33.8% of participants displaying high-increasing depressive symptom patterns. COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences including health concerns, caregiving burden, and lack of access to resources were associated with worsening of the depressive symptom trajectories. Frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies and less frequent use of emotion-focused coping strategies were associated with the high and increasing depressive symptom pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are specific to subgroups within the population and stressors may persist and worsen over time. Providing access to evidence-informed approaches that foster adaptive coping, alleviate the depressive symptoms, and promote the mental health of working adults is critical.","output":"The trajectories of depressive symptoms among working adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal analysis of the InHamilton COVID-19 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two rapid tests for the coronavirus will be rolled out in the UK, but neither is supported by published data, reports Jessica Hamzelou","output":"Rapid tests questioned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prone position (PP) is increasingly used in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. However, studies investigating the influence of the PP are currently lacking in these patients. This is the first study to investigate the influence of the PP on the oxygenation and decarboxylation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective bicentric study design was used, and in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, PP was indicated from a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio of <200. Patients were left prone for 16 h each. Pressure levels, FIO2, were adjusted to ensure a PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg. Blood gas analyses were performed before (baseline 0.5 h), during (1/2/5.5/9.5/13 h), and after being in the PP (1 h), the circulatory/ventilation parameters were continuously monitored, and lung compliance (LC) was roughly calculated. Responders were defined compared to the baseline value (PaO2/FIO2 ratio increase of &#8805;15%; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) decrease of &#8805;2%). RESULTS: 13 patients were included and 36 PP sessions were conducted. Overall, PaO2/FIO2 increased significantly in the PP (p < 0.001). Most PaO2/FIO2 responders (29/36 PP sessions, 77%) were identified 9.5 h after turning prone (14% slow responders), while most PaCO2 responders (15/36 PP sessions, 42%) were identified 13 h after turning prone. A subgroup of patients (interval intubation to PP &#8805;3 days) showed less PaO2/FIO2 responders (16% vs. 77%). An increase in PaCO2 and minute ventilation in the PP showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). LC (median before the PP = 38 mL/cm H2O; two patients with LC >80 mL/cm H2O) showed a significant positive correlation with the 28 day survival of patients (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The PP significantly improves oxygenation in COVID-19 ARDS patients. The data suggest that they also benefit most from an early PP. A decrease in minute ventilation may result in fewer PaCO2 responders. LC may be a predictive outcome parameter in COVID-19 patients.

Tregs are critical for preventing systemic autoimmunity and maintaining peripheral tolerance, and yet they also assist in orchestration of immunity to pathogenic insult, wherein they limit collateral immunopathology and assist in facilitating a fine balance between immune tolerance and effector activity. Tregs have been extensively studied in lymphoid tissues, and a growing body of work has characterized phenotypically distinct Tregs localized in various nonlymphoid tissue compartments. These tissue Tregs can perform location-specific, alternative functions, highlighting their dynamic, context-dependent roles. Tregs have also been identified in mucosal tissues where specialized physiological functions are paramount, including helping the host to respond appropriately to pathogenic versus innocuous antigens that are abundant at mucosal portals of antigen entry. As in other tissue Treg compartments, mucosal Tregs in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts are distinct from circulating counterparts and can carry out mucosa-specific functions as well as classic suppressive functions that are the hallmark of Tregs.

The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) up and down state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the up state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in up state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.","output":"Glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Control the Receptor Binding Domain Conformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering from pneumonia from unknown causes.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 44 commercial poultry farms in Oyo and Kano states of Nigeria. Serum and tissue samples and data on flock, clinical and vaccination records were collected on each farm. Farms were classified as being protected or not protected against ND, IBD and IB based on a defined criterion. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing was performed for each target virus on tissue samples and positive samples were sequenced. A total of 15/44 (34.1%), 35/44 (79.5%), and 1/44 (2.3%) farms were considered to be protected against ND, IBD, and IB, respectively, at the time of sampling. NDV RNA was detected on 7/44 (15.9%) farms and sequences obtained from 3/7 farms were characterized as the lentogenic strain. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) RNA was detected on 16/44 (36.4%) farms tested; very virulent (vv) IBDV and non-virulent (nv) IBDV strains were both detected in 3/16 (18.8%) positive samples. Sequences of IBDV isolates were either clustered with a group of genotype 3 virulent IBDV strains or were related to vaccine strains MB and D78 strains.

Sequences of IBV isolates were either clustered with the vaccines strains Massachusetts M41 and H120 or were most closely related to the D274-like strains or a clade of sequences reported in Nigeria and Niger in 2006 and 2007. This study revealed that most study farms in Oyo and Kano states did not have adequate protective antibody titers against IBV and NDV and were therefore at risk of field challenge. Infectious bursal disease virus and IBV RNA were detected on farms with a history of vaccination suggesting potential vaccination failure, or that the vaccine strains used mismatch with the circulating strains and are therefore not protective.","output":"Evaluating Disease Threats to Sustainable Poultry Production in Africa: Newcastle Disease, Infectious Bursal Disease, and Avian Infectious Bronchitis in Commercial Poultry Flocks in Kano and Oyo States, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite one of the world's strictest and longest lockdown policies, the Philippines' securitized approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unnecessary suffering, especially in poor communities This article explores how the Philippine government's prioritizing of punitive policies such as detaining quarantine violators or attempting to decongest Manila by sending poor families to neighbouring provinces, magnifies existing socio-spatial inequalities and further spreads disease In many of these communities, poverty is a co-morbidity As local governments struggle to provide frontline health and social welfare services, high-profile arrests, media shutdowns, and the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill spark concerns about restrictions on free speech while movement is curtailed Nevertheless, community and private sector efforts around localized healthcare, food security, and inclusive mobility indicate potential paths towards a 'better normal' that goes beyond just survival","output":"Misplaced Priorities, Unnecessary Effects: Collective Suffering and Survival in Pandemic Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) treatment consists of eculizumab.

Goal of this study was to compare VRP parameters when performed without and with FFP2/3 masks. Further, formant analysis for sustained vowels, singer's formant and analysis of reading standard text samples were performed without/with FFP2/3 masks. METHODS: 20 subjects (6 male and 14 female) were enrolled in this study with an average age of 3616 y (mean  SD). 14 patients were rated as euphonic/not hoarse and 6 patients as mildly hoarse. All subjects underwent the VRP measurements, vowel and text recordings without/with FFP2/3 mask using the software DiVAS by XION medical (Berlin, Germany). Voice range of singing voice, equivalent of voice extension measure (eVEM), fundamental frequency (F0), sound pressure level (SPL) of soft speaking and shouting were calculated and analyzed. Maximum phonation time (MPT) and jitter-% were included for Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) measurement. Analyses of singer's formant were performed. Spectral analyses of sustained vowels /a:/, /i:/ and /u:/ (first=F1 and second=F2 formants), intensity of long term average spectrum (LTAS) and alpha-ratio (-ratio) were calculated using the freeware praat. RESULTS: For all subjects the mean values of routine voice parameters without/with mask were analyzed: no significant differences were found in results of singing voice range, eVEM. SPL and frequency of soft speaking/shouting, except significant lower mean SPL of shouting with FFP2/3 mask, in particular that of the female subjects (p=0.002). Results of MPT, jitter and DSI without/with FFP2/3 mask showed no significant differences.

The longest P-wave duration, shortest P-wave durations, P-wave dispersion and P-wave peak duration were calculated in the surface electrocardiography of these patients. Results: Patients with both real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive and pneumonia had the highest P-wave maximum duration (113.089.671 ms vs 102.447.412 ms. and 99.189.292 ms;p=0.000) and the highest P-wave dispersion (53.347.705 ms vs 40.584.813 ms. and 35.424.116 ms;p=0.000) and the longest P-wave peak time (56.797.767 ms vs 51.92 ms 6.443 ms and 50.5511.63 ms;p=0.008).

Hires of black, Hispanic, and Asian American faculty declined disproportionately. Public institutions and research-oriented institutions, which faced the greatest resource challenges and uncertainty about the future, made the biggest cuts in the hiring of people of color.

We aimed to investigate whether there was a gender imbalance in the division of household labour within families during the pandemic, and whether this imbalance was associated with gender differences in personal outcomes (work-family conflict, burnout) as well as career-related outcomes (career self-efficacy and aspirations). Participants were 240 heterosexual individuals with or without caregiving responsibilities who lived with a partner and worked from home during the pandemic. They completed self-report questionnaires and indicated the division of domestic tasks within their household, the extent to which they experienced burnout and work-family conflict, and their career aspirations and career self-efficacy. The findings showed a significant gender imbalance, such that female caregivers spent significantly less time on work compared to the other groups and significantly more time on caregiving compared to male caregivers during the lockdown. There was a significant direct effect of caregiving on career outcomes for women, such that the more caregiving women performed during the lockdown relative to other tasks, the more negative their self-reported career outcomes were. Among men, caregiving did not predict career outcomes. Overall, our study showed that the gender imbalance in distributions of caregiving duties during the pandemic is associated with negative personal and professional outcomes for women who are caregivers. Practical implications are discussed accounting for this gender imbalance in the context of the pandemic and its influence on wellbeing and career outcomes, particularly for heterosexual women.

Post declaration, India announced lockdown and various guidelines were issued by Health authorities worldwide for the organizations to function in this emergency aeon. Different organizations strategized differently to respond to COVID 19 pandemic. The aim was to implement COVID 19 guidelines across all the centres of a chain of Eye hospitals in India in short span of time overcoming the challenges. METHODS: A SMART strategy was confabulated within the team. There were numerous challenges like lack of time, rapidly changing guidelines, no travelling scenarios, training and educating the staff in huge numbers, rapidly evolving situation, change management, need of increased vigilance, and language barrier at certain centres, sustaining quality assurance and motivating the staff in stressful times. The challenges were surpassed using a power packed strategy, dedicated efforts and team work grasping the available tools and technology from a single location. This template can serve us and other hospitals to respond in a better way for similar future challenges. RESULTS: The COVID 19 protocols were implemented across all the centres successfully. The entire Quality assurance system drifted to online platform and education and awareness methods took the digital thread. Teamwork synergized with the aforementioned things and we came out with flying colours achieving the goals in short span of time overcoming all the barriers.

Addressing the major challenges that we face from climate change can often appear to conflict with economic priorities. Add to this the fact that environmental mitigation steps can inadvertently exclude sections of the population and the enormity and complexity of climate change responses can result in paralysis.

A mean glucose level upon hospital admission >166 mg/dl correlates positively with acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with hyperglycemia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between sustained hyperglycemia and the outcome of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. We also evaluated the effect of high glucose concentrations on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We carried out a case-control study with hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 with and without sustained hyperglycemia. In a second stage, we performed in vitro assays evaluating the effects of high glucose concentrations on ACE2 gene expression. Fifty hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were included, of which 28 (56%) died and 22 (44%) recovered. Patients who died due to COVID-19 and COVID-19 survivors had a high prevalence of hyperglycemia (96.4% versus 90.9%), with elevated central glucose upon admission (197.7 mg/dl versus 155.9 mg/dl, p = 0.089) and at discharge (185.2 mg/dl versus 134 mg/dl, p = 0.038). The mean hypoxemia level upon hospital admission was 81% in patients who died due to COVID-19 complications and 88% in patients who survived (p = 0.026); at the time of discharge, hypoxemia levels were also different between the groups (68% versus 92%, p  0.001). In vitro assays showed that the viability of A549 cells decreased (76.41%) as the glucose concentration increased, and the ACE2 gene was overexpressed 9.91-fold after 72 h (p  0.001). The relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 plays an important role in COVID-19-related complications and the outcome for these patients.

Due to social distancing measures introduced during the pandemic, face-to-face contact between staff and patients had to be minimised. This led to an increase in remote prescribing, including from home. Feedback from team doctors was that the process of following the Remote Prescribing Protocol (RPP) was taking up a significant portion of their day, preventing them from doing other clinical work. Our aim was to reduce the time taken to complete a remote prescription to pre-pandemic levels (under 15 minutes). Method We used PDSA methodology in this QI project: Plan: Survey sent out to team duty doctors to identify the most time-consuming steps in RPP which could be safely delegated to administrative staff Do: Email sent requesting administrative staff clarify several details with patients/families when they request a prescription. This included the names and doses of medication, how many days they had left, where they wanted the prescription sent to (home/pharmacy) and the relevant address. If the patient usually received their repeat prescription from their GP, they were re-directed to their GP Study: Following the intervention above, team doctors recorded how long it took to complete a remote prescription Result The average time taken to complete a prescription fell from 31 minutes (pre-intervention) to 22 minutes (post-intervention). The range of time taken also dropped from 10-241 minutes (pre-intervention) to 0-46 minutes (post-intervention). The medications taking above the average time to complete were more likely to be non-controlled drugs rather than controlled drugs (which one may typically think would be more time-consuming to write out). Conclusion Whilst we have successfully reduced the time for remote prescribing, we have not reached the target of reducing it down to less than 15 minutes (pre-pandemic timings). As part of the next PDSA cycle, we have carried out a survey to ask what barriers remain. Checking patient's notes and recent prescriptions can still be inefficient. We propose introducing an intervention whereby this can also be safety delegated to administrative staff e.g. including a copy of the most recent prescription in the request. In the future, we will continue to improve the RPP with further PDSA cycles and carry out an audit on the system on a regular basis to ensure standards are met.","output":"Improving remote prescribing in a CAMHS community team during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this work is to study the dynamics of a fractional-order Covid-19 model.

However, strict confinement had a particular impact on people suffering from misophonia and their families. Misophonia is a condition in which hearing certain sounds triggers intense anger, disgust and even severe autonomic nervous system responses. This prospective cohort study examined the impact of strict confinement (Spain, March 14CJune 21, 2020) on a sample of 24 people (16 women and eight men) who had been diagnosed with moderate to extreme misophonia and were regularly attending a medical psychology center in Barcelona. The 3-month period of confinement caused general emotional maladjustment, distress, and a transitory crisis. Long-term biomonitoring of their heart variability rate (HRV) enabled to identify a significant increase in physiological arousal after the confinement period, which had already been recorded in a loss of cardiac coherence under basal rest/relaxation conditions. Certain auditory stimuli triggered adverse responses, lowered HRV scores, and an increased stress level and heart rate. Loss of cardiac coherence in their responses to these auditory stimuli (triggering mouth, nose and other sounds), as well as to non-triggering mouth, nose and other sounds was increased when compared to two assessments performed during the previous year. Despite the limited sample size, sex differences were observed in the incidence. Loss of cardiac coherence worsened with the severity of the misophonia. Most importantly, imagined or evoked triggering sounds, as well as real ones, were enough to cause the aversive responses, as displayed by the increased loss of cardiac coherence with respect to the at-rest basal level. A semi-structured interview revealed the exceptional nature of the situations, increased hyper-sensorial sensitivity, fear of being infected with or dying from COVID-19, the patients' coping strategies, and the difficulties and constraints they faced. Finally, the article gives recommendations for better management of misophonia. Improved knowledge of this disorder would help address the current lack of health and social care, hopefully preventing this shortfall's impact on social and affective relationships, which are particulary important for well-being now and in the coming periods of physical distancing measures.","output":"Sounds of Silence in Times of COVID-19: Distress and Loss of Cardiac Coherence in People With Misophonia Caused by Real, Imagined or Evoked Triggering Sounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Pregnant women are a vulnerable group to the COVID-19 infection;although it is expected that adaptive changes of pregnancy put them at increased risk of adverse outcome from any respiratory tract infection, interventions for the COVID-19 may put them in more danger Nigeria is one of the leading countries with very poor maternal mortality indices and many other sub-Saharan African nations are in the same boat Contingency plans need to beput in place to prevent precipitous deterioration in mortality rates occasioned by the dreaded SARS-Cov-2 pandemic This mini-review of literature and WHO global statistics is aimed to determine the trends in COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates to provide evidence-based information that may enable governments to tailor their interventions to the peculiar needs, of sub-Saharan African populations Main body:Emerging epidemiological trends on transmission and mortality within Africa and the worst affected regions of the world suggests better outcomes of this infection in sub-Saharan Africa, than in other regions of the world Also, present data allude to similar outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant women The present containment measures of isolation and quarantine, including city-wide lockdowns, may put pregnant women at higher risk of death from other causes rather than COVID-19 The danger posed, is the limitation of access to emergency obstetric care services when pregnant women develop non-COVID-19 complications of pregnancy Conclusion:The COVID-19 pandemic has lower local transmission rates and fatality in Africa, the region where the virus arrived last While special efforts should be geared at shielding the elderly and infirm from contracting the infection, preventive measures in pregnant women must allow for access to emergency obstetric care to forestall iatrogenic adverse maternal outcomes","output":"Emerging statistics on the epidemiology of COVID-19: Making prevention in pregnancy less grievous than the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ceramic tiles are bacteriostatic materials;however, the COVID-19 emergency has pushed tile producers to improve surfaces antibacterial properties.

Wide differences emerge between Germany, France and the UK on the one hand, and Italy and Spain on the other. Estimation of the housing cost burden by means of logit models allows us to relate the probability of a high burden to both micro and macro-economic variables and to identify differences among countries. As for socio-economic variables, our results reveal the existence of life-cycle effects and a lower burden for homeowners. As for aggregate variables, GDP growth and higher consumer confidence contribute to reducing the probability of a high burden, whereas high levels of unemployment and inequality contribute to increase it. At country level, we observe differences in the size of the impact of the explanatory variables on the probability of perceiving a high burden, especially for covariates such as age, homeownership status and education.","output":"Differences in Perceptions of the Housing Cost Burden Among European Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: passive immunotherapy is a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19.

The aim of this work was to renew the epidemiology characteristics of respiratory pathogens found in children and adults with RTIs from 2018 to 2020 in southern China. Methods: : In this work, a total of 134,552 nasopharyngeal or throat swabs (patients from 407 hospitals) were analyzed, and fourteen respiratory viruses (Influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human Coronavirus, human bocavirus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae) were detected using PCR/RT-PCR. Result: The most common respiratory pathogens in southern china were ADV (16.19%), RSV (15.48%), RHV (11.51%), IAV (10.93%), MP (8.95%), EBV (8.70%), PIV (7.67%), IBV (5.44%), with IAV and ADV as the most prevalent pathogens in adults (11.68%) and children (17.10%) respectively. In detail, ADV (16.30%) and RSV (18.93%) are most common in 0-4 years old, with IAV (16.68%), ADV (20.36%) in 5-14 years old, with EBV (7.48%, 8.74%), IAV (15.43, 9.76%) in 15-49y, 50-64y and IAV (7.37%), IBV (2.43%) in 65-105y. Over three years witnessed an increase in PDR of PIV in 0-4y, 5-14y and 65-105y, and RHV in 5-14y and 15-49y. In month distribution, the positive detection rate of pathogens in adults were generally lower than that in children except for EBV and majority of pathogens has shown a sharp decline in 2020. In Upper RTIs, 77.27% (17/ 22) of co-infected patients had infection to ADV, with poly-infection to ADV and RHV the highest (8/22). In Lower RTIs, the ADV infected patients showed that its co-infection rate to MP, PIV, RHV or RSV were 19.51% (48/246), 15.45% (38/246), 14.63% (36/246) and 14.63% (36/246) respectively. Only IAV, IBV and EBV were detected in co-infection patients with lower RTIs. Conclusion: IAV and ADV were the most important respiratory pathogen in adults and children respectively in southern Chin and cross-reactivity might exist between ADV, RHV, PIV and MP. These should be taken into consideration when they formulate the strategies for co-infection avoidance in patients.","output":"Epidemiology Characteristic and Co-infection Pattern of Pathogens in Patients With Respiratory Tract Infection in Southern China, 2018-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most African countries have recorded relatively lower COVID-19 burdens than Western countries. This has been attributed to early and strong political commitment and robust implementation of public health measures, such as nationwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, face mask wearing, testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with community education and engagement. Other factors include the younger population age strata and hypothesized but yet-to-be confirmed partially protective cross-immunity from parasitic diseases and/or other circulating coronaviruses. However, the true burden may also be underestimated due to operational and resource issues for COVID-19 case identification and reporting. In this perspective article, we discuss selected best practices and challenges with COVID-19 contact tracing in Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. Best practices from these country case studies include sustained, multi-platform public communications; leveraging of technology innovations; applied public health expertise; deployment of community health workers; and robust community engagement. Challenges include an overwhelming workload of contact tracing and case detection for healthcare workers, misinformation and stigma, and poorly sustained adherence to isolation and quarantine. Important lessons learned include the need for decentralization of contact tracing to the lowest geographic levels of surveillance, rigorous use of data and technology to improve decision-making, and sustainment of both community sensitization and political commitment. Further research is needed to understand the role and importance of contact tracing in controlling community transmission dynamics in African countries, including among children. Also, implementation science will be critically needed to evaluate innovative, accessible, and cost-effective digital solutions to accommodate the contact tracing workload.","output":"Contact Tracing and the COVID-19 Response in Africa: Best Practices, Key Challenges, and Lessons Learned from Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 that has affected the world with over two million cases globally Malaysia has witnessed over 5,000 thousand with almost 1","output":"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Petaling District, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Life expectancy varies across geographical and political landscapes for a multitude of reasons Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pandemic, is present in 215 countries, and is described as a pathogen that is most deadly to individuals 65 years and older However, it is unclear if the majority of COVID-19-related deaths are targeting individuals above or below life expectancy Methods: Through seven months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an association between life expectancy and COVID-19 related deaths was assessed The reported age of those suffering from COVID-19-related deaths was evaluated across eight countries (United States, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland), and placed into binary categories depending on whether or not the death occurred above or below the country's life expectancy Results: Given this dataset, it was observed that there was a greater proportion of COVID related deaths above life expectancy (M=64 58%, SD=6 46) as opposed to below life expectancy (M=35 41%, SD=6 46), as these differences were significant (95%CI [18 518, 42 881], p&lt;0 001) In contrast, an insignificant trend was observed when examining the relationship between deaths above life expectancy and Gini index (Pearson correlation coefficient r= -0 62, n=8, p=0 09) The disparity, or percent difference in death occurring above versus below life expectancy was greatest in the countries with life expectancies of 80+ (Sweden, Switzerland, Germany) Conclusions: Considering life expectancy may be an appropriate approach for reporting COVID-19-related deaths, as well as planning responses to localized COVID-19 outbreaks, prioritizing drug treatment, and assessing ICU capacity [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Germs is the property of Asociatia Pentru Cresterea Vizibilitatii Cercetarii Stiintifice (ACVCS) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Across regions: Are most COVID-19 deaths above or below life expectancy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, millions of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections with hundreds of thousands of deaths already reported.

The questionnaire is based on literature and includes the perceived level of stress scale. RESULTS: We found no significant association between the use of PPE and stress. Nurses who wore masks for more than 8 h had significant higher stress levels than those who used the masks for a shorter period. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of wearing masks is associated with nurse's stress level. Our findings can help nurses to argue a higher frequency of breaks and a maximum duration of mask usage in their organisations.

Results of the observational studies published during this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-center, parallel group, randomized controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. METHODS: 60 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more liters of oxygen to maintain a saturation of &#8805;92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomized to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. RESULTS: In the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the 2 groups and there were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure is feasible and safe under clinical trial conditions.

METHODS: Ninety-one HERV-K indexes with entire proviral sequences were used as the reference database. Nine raw sequencing datasets with 243 BCa and 137 control samples were mapped to this database by Salmon software. The differential proviral expression across several groups was analyzed by DESeq2 software. RESULTS: First, the clustering of each dataset demonstrated that these 91 HERV-K proviruses could well cluster the BCa and control samples when the normal controls were normal cells or healthy donor tissues. Second, several common HERV-K proviruses that are closely related with BCa risk were significantly differentially expressed (p(adj) < 0.05 and absolute log2FC > 1.5) in the tissues and cell lines. Additionally, almost all the HERV-K proviruses had higher expression in BCa tissue than in healthy donor tissue. Notably, we first found the expression of 17p13.1 provirus that located with TP53 should regulate TP53 expression in ER+ and HER2+ BCa. CONCLUSION: The expression profiling of these 91 HERV-K proviruses can be used as biomarkers to distinguish individuals with BCa and healthy controls. Some proviruses, especially 17p13.1, were strongly associated with BCa risk. The results suggest that HERV-K expression profiles may be appropriate biomarkers and targets for BCa.","output":"Screening and Identification of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K mRNAs for Breast Cancer Through Integrative Analysis of Multiple Datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Massage and touch-based treatment are popular despite limited evidence from high quality clinical trials. This article reviews the rationale and evidence of treating older patients with psychiatric symptoms by touch-based therapy. METHODS: Narrative literature review, based on Medline search with the following key words: massage, social touch, affective touch, clinical trial, meta-analysis. Citations of identified articles were searched for additional relevant studies. RESULTS: Evidence from clinical trials in adult patients with mainly chronic disorders of the musculoskeletal system suggests that massage therapy results in significant short-term improvement of symptoms; however, treatment effects appear not to be sustained. In addition, conclusions are difficult to draw owing to very heterogeneous study interventions, difficulties with definition of control conditions and treatment outcomes. There appears to be better evidence for improvement of psychological variables and subjective symptoms, such as pain and quality of life. A neuronal system of affective and social touch has been identified with specific afferents from C?fibre coupled low threshold mechanoreceptors projecting into the insular cortex and the limbic system. This system may also mediate effects of massage in adult patients. Positive clinical trials for depressive symptoms of dementia and for behavioral symptoms of advanced dementia are available with encouraging results. CONCLUSION: The neuronal system of social and affective touch suggests a potential mechanism of action of touch-based interventions in geriatric psychiatry. In addition, it provides a rationale for applying and designing novel touch-based treatment strategies as adjunctive treatment for psychiatric disorders of old age.","output":"Massage and touch-based therapy: Clinical evidence, neurobiology and applications in older patients with psychiatric symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, the degree of its negative impact on the development of economic systems throughout the world economy increases. At the same time, the issues of the future world order and the restoration of the global economy are becoming more and more uncertain. The purpose of our study was to review the conceptual and practical approaches to substantiating the possibilities of postcrisis recovery of the global economy in the context of the continuing negative impact of the pandemic on international trade, capital flows and the development of the world financial system. The article reviews the materials of international economic organizations to assess the longterm economic consequences of the pandemic. The analysis shows that the main problem in assessing the possibilities for the recovery of the world economy is the existing heterogeneity in the degree of the pandemic's impact on individual sectors and economies of countries, as well as the differentiation and inconsistency of the applied economic policy instruments. In addition, it was found that the world retains a high potential for financial instability, and \\"vaccine nationalism\\" is getting worse. The main contradiction is the transboundary nature of the challenges to further economic development with a significant slowdown in globalization pro-cesses. The author considers the current pandemic to be one of the new global problems of the world economy, since its recovery in the current conditions is of an indefinite spasmodic nature, and there are also risks of a permanent slowdown in economic mobility. The solution to the key problem of economic growth - increasing productivity - is possible only with a clear understanding and planning of progress with inclusive vaccination, which is so far elusive. Although shortterm economic policy is a priority for governments, a wellcoordinated international agenda is needed at the global level to ensure the transition from income support to stimulating economic growth, as well as to overcome the existing structural imbalances and distortions in the system of economic relations between countries.","output":"Post-Pandemic Recovery of the Global Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical history of COVID-19 was an exclusion criterion in the clinical trial that led to the vaccination regimen of two-doses for the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Herein, we have analyzed a wide panel of immune responses triggered by this immunization in a cohort of na?ve and COVID-19-recovered individuals. Plasma levels of S-specific immunoglobulins peaked after one vaccine shot in COVID-19-recovered individuals, while a second dose was needed in na?ve subjects to achieve similar levels. However, na?ve individuals did not reach as much neutralizing titers as COVID-19-recovered participants did after a complete vaccination regimen. At that point, after T cell stimulation with S-protein antigens from SARS-CoV-2, na?ve individuals exhibited higher cytokine production levels, CD4+ T cells activation and proliferation than COVID-19-recovered individuals. Moreover, patent inverse correlations were observed between humoral and cellular immune variables, discriminating na?ve from COVID-19-recovered subjects.

In addition to respiratory infections, SARS-COV-2 has been shown to include cardiovascular (CV) complications, including myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome. Risk of severe complications from SARS-COV-2 in individuals with existing CV and metabolic disease has been shown to be increased. Evidence indicates SARS-COV-2 enters tissues via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and that the virus is primed and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The goal of this study was to determine ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in pre-clinical swine models of heart failure (HF). We hypothesized sex, pressure-overload, and comorbidities would increase ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels. A retrospective analysis was conducted in previously completed studies in our lab including: 1) Female, intact Ossabaw swine that were either lean control or western diet-fed aortic-banded (N=4-5/group);2) Female Yucatan mini-swine subject to ovariectomy and/or aortic banding (N=5-8/group);and 3) Sedentary and exercise trained male, intact Yucatan mini-swine that were aortic banded. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and coronary vasculature using qRT-PCR. Linear regression analysis was used to determine differences between the following variables: pig species, sex hormones, aortic banding, comorbidities, exercise training, and tissue. Data was log-transformed to meet linear regression assumptions. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were significantly influenced by sex, comorbidity, and tissue type. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were also influenced by species and disease status. Specifically, ACE2 mRNA levels decreased 57.1% in the LV and increased 169.9% in the RV of males compared to coronary vessels in intact females. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased in the LV and RV of males (1,218.6% and 5,479.8%, respectively) compared to coronary vessels in intact females. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 344% and 453.4%, respectively, in the LV of Ossabaw swine fed a Western Diet compared to coronary vessels from Yucatan and Ossabaw swine without comorbidities. Species differences indicated TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 449.2% in the RV and 498.6% in the LV in Yucatan mini-swine compared to coronary vessels in Ossabaw swine. A 107.3% increase in TMPRSS2 mRNA level was observed in male swine without HF compared to female intact swine with HF highlighting the importance of sex and disease state. Exercise training did not impact ACE2 or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels irrespective of tissue. In conclusion, these results suggest differences in RV, LV and coronary mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are dependent upon sex and comorbidities. TMPRSS2 levels are additionally influenced by pig species and pressure-overload. These results provide insight into how ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels may influence the cardiovascular involvement of SARS-COV-2 infection in an experimental setting of pre-clinical HF incorporating different swine species, sex, and comorbidities.","output":"Tissue-Specific Differences in Myocardial and Coronary Vascular ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA Levels are Dependent Upon Sex, Comorbidities, Pressure-Overload, and Pig Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emerged as the most challenging global health problem of this century. The concomitant presence of co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, CHD, further complicates the problem. AIM: To assess the patterns of LFT abnormalities in patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without CKD and evaluate the probable outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective observational study done on 600 patient samples (Group 1: SARS-CoV-2 without CKD, Group 2: SARS-CoV-2 with CKD and Group 3: CKD uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) which were processed for LFT and KFT. RESULTS: AST and ALT were significantly higher in all SARS-CoV-2 infected; Group 1 mean  2SD, (63.63  42.89U/L & 50.25  46.53U/L), group 2 (90.59  62.51U/L & 72.09  67.24 U/L) as compared to Group 3 (25.24  7.47U/L & 24.93  11.44U/L). A statistically significant elevation is seen in these two parameters in Group 2 as compared to Group 1. There was a negative significant correlation between eGFR and AST/ALT levels in Group 1 (p < 0.05). In Group 2, a weak positive correlation was seen with ALT. Group 3, eGFRs showed strong correlations with AST and ALT levels; reduction in kidney function correlated well with increase in serum ALP levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes that SARS-CoV-2 infected, with CKD, show higher elevations in serum aminotransferase levels in comparison to those without CKD. In contrast, the CKD group not infected, shows a decline in serum aminotransferase levels. Serum ALT values in SARS-CoV-2 show significant correlation with eGFR. Also, elevated ALP values in CKD patients may be used as an indicator of declining kidney function.","output":"An evaluation of liver function tests in severe acute respiratory syndrome - Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the backdrop of chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we use exponentiated exponential distribution as a suitable statistical lifetime model for novel corona virus (covid-19) Kerala patient data.

Patients with cancer are at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19, but it is not well known whether COVID-19 outcomes in this patient population were associated with geography. OBJECTIVE: To quantify spatiotemporal variation in COVID-19 outcomes among patients with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This registry-based retrospective cohort study included patients with a historical diagnosis of invasive malignant neoplasm and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and November 2020. Data were collected from cancer care delivery centers in the United States. EXPOSURES: Patient residence was categorized into 9 US census divisions. Cancer center characteristics included academic or community classification, rural-urban continuum code (RUCC), and social vulnerability index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome consisted of receipt of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and all-cause death. Multilevel mixed-effects models estimated associations of center-level and census divisionClevel exposures with outcomes after adjustment for patient-level risk factors and quantified variation in adjusted outcomes across centers, census divisions, and calendar time. RESULTS: Data for 4749 patients (median [IQR] age, 66 [56-76] years; 2439 [51.4%] female individuals, 1079 [22.7%] non-Hispanic Black individuals, and 690 [14.5%] Hispanic individuals) were reported from 83 centers in the Northeast (1564 patients [32.9%]), Midwest (1638 [34.5%]), South (894 [18.8%]), and West (653 [13.8%]). After adjustment for patient characteristics, including month of COVID-19 diagnosis, estimated 30-day mortality rates ranged from 5.2% to 26.6% across centers. Patients from centers located in metropolitan areas with population less than 250 000 (RUCC 3) had lower odds of 30-day mortality compared with patients from centers in metropolitan areas with population at least 1 million (RUCC 1) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.84). The type of center was not significantly associated with primary or secondary outcomes. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome rates across the 9 census divisions, but adjusted mortality rates significantly improved over time (eg, September to November vs March to May: aOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17-0.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this registry-based cohort study, significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes across US census divisions were not observed. However, substantial heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes across cancer care delivery centers was found.

Disparities on the provider side include ordering of initial or follow-up imaging studies and providing standard-of-care interventional procedures, while patient factors include differences in awareness of screening exams and confidence in the healthcare system. Disparate utilization of mammography and lung cancer screening lead to delayed diagnosis, while differential provision of minimally invasive interventional procedures contributes to differential outcomes related to treatment. Interventions designed to mitigate social determinants of health could help to equalize the healthcare system. Here we review disparities in access and health outcomes in radiology.

This research was conducted using a 3D printer and a simple mechanical system. Handless door openers are made for the lever handle type. With a weight of 15 kg like the weight of a regular footstep the design can move the handle and open the door. The use of this door opener on a broader scale is expected to suppress the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The design of feet-based door opener to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through doorknob"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: On February 26(th) 2020, a high alert was issued in Sweden in response to the diagnosis of the first few coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the country. Subsequently, a decreased supply of essential goods, including medical products, was anticipated. We aimed to explore the weekly patterns of prescription dispensing and over-the-counter (OTC) medication sales in Sweden in 2020 compared with previous years, to assess the influence of the government restrictions on medication sales, and to assess whether there is evidence of medication stockpiling in the population. METHODS: Aggregated data on the weekly volume of defined daily doses (of prescription medication dispensed and OTC sales from 2015 to 2020 were examined. From 2015C2019 data, the predicted weekly volume of s f2020 was estimated and compared to the observed volume for each ATC anatomical main group and therapeutic subgroup. RESULTS: From mid-February to mid-March 2020, there were increases in the weekly volumes of dispensed medication, peaking in the second week of March with a 46% increase in the observed versus predicted number of s disped (16,440 vs 11,260 s per 100nhabitants). A similar pattern was found in all age groups, in both sexes, and across metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions. In the same week in March, there was a 96% increase in the volume of OTC sold (2,504 vs 1,277 s per 1000 ibitants), specifically in ATC therapeutic subgroups including vitamins, antipyretics, painkillers, and nasal, throat, cough and cold preparations. CONCLUSION: Beginning in mid-February 2020, there were significant changes in the volume of prescription medication dispensed and OTC drugs sold. The weekly volume of s quickly decred following recommendations from public authorities. Overall, our findings suggest stockpiling behavior over a surge in new users of medication.","output":"Patterns of prescription dispensation and over-the-counter medication sales in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic.

Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact 1 in the oligomeric form (200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in vitro was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact 1 oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region.

There were 114 valid questionnaires returned;The scores of nurse's Organizational justice, Distributive justice, Procedural justice and Interactive justice, Organizational identity,and Job involvement were 3.5320.581, 3.3970.691, 3.4870.729, 3.8400.641 and 3.9120.615 respectively. The score of organization justice positively correlated with the scores of Organizational identity (r=0.627, P&lt;0.001), and positively correlated with the score of Job involvement (r=0.627,P&lt;0.001). The scores of Organizational identity were positively correlated with the score of Job involvement (r=0.724,P&lt;0.001). The results of regression analysis showed that Organizational justice, Organizational identity can positively affect nurses' Job involvement, and explained 59.9% of the cumulative variance. At the same time,Organization identity played a partial mediating role between Organizational justice, as well as its three sub-dimensions and Job involvement. The scores of Organizational justice and Job involvement in selected nurses in Zhuhai are only a little higher than the average levels, which needs to be improved.

From 2017 to 2020, the New England Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) collected data in real-time on the training and technical assistance (TA) requested and attended by the front-line workforce. This article synthesizes practice-based evidence on the types of TA requests, topics of TA, attendance numbers, and socio-demographics of TA attendees over a 3-year period spanning an unprecedented public health syndemic. METHODS: We assessed TA events hosted by the New England ATTC using SAMHSAs Performance Accountability and Reporting System post-event survey data from 2017 to 2020. Events were coded by common themes to identify the most frequently requested training types/topics and most frequently attended training events. We also evaluated change in training topics and attendee demographics over the three-year timeline. RESULTS: A total of 258 ATTC events reaching 10,143 participants were analyzed. The number of TA events and attendance numbers surged in the 2019C2020 fiscal year as TA events shifted to fully virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absolute number of opioid-related events increased, but the relative proportion remained stable over time. The relative proportions of events and attendance rates focused on evidence-based practice and health equity both increased over the 3-year period, with the largest increase after the onset of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd. As events shifted to virtual, events were attended by providers with a broader range of educational backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current analysis indicate that the demand for TA increased during the pandemic, with a prioritization of TA focused on evidence-based practice and health equity. The practice-based evidence generated from the New England ATTC may help other training and TA centers to anticipate and nimbly respond to the needs of the workforce in the face of the intersecting epidemics.","output":"Substance use workforce training needs during intersecting epidemics: an analysis of events offered by a regional training center from 2017 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifac-torial condition with intestinal, psychological, and environmental factors participating to symptoms onset. The enforced condition of isolation due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to radical changes in lifestyle, probably affecting quality of life (QoL) and mental health. Our aim was to investigate the influence of COVID-19 lockdown in a well-studied cohort of IBS patients. Materials and methods: 41 IBS patients (28F, age range 18-65 ys) from the outpatients clinic of the University Federico II of Naples were invited to join an online survey during the first and second lockdown (April - October 2020). The survey consisted of 5 sections assessing: i) anthropometric data, ii) IBS symptoms (IBS symptom severity scale, IBS-SSS and Bristol Stool Form Scale, BSFS), iii) life-style changes, iv) psychological data (Visceral Sensitivity Index, VSI, and Patient Health Questionnaire-15, PH15), v) QoL (Short Form 12, SF-12, including the physical and mental component summary;PCS and MCS, respectively). Data from the first (T1) and second (T2) lockdown were compared with those collected in person before the pandemic (T0). Results: All subjects completed the study. Compared to baseline, at T1 there was a significant improvement in IBS symptoms (25769 vs 222105), loose stools frequency (41 vs 22) and PCS (46 7 vs 517;all p<0,05), whilst MCS remained unchanged (4010 vs 4110). These findings were associated with a radical change in lifestyle with 81% of the subjects working remotely from home. At T2, both BSFS and PCS (41 vs 22 and 466 vs 508;all p<0,05) remained steadily improved;however, IBS-SSS scores returned to baseline (25769 vs 24593). This effect was not associated with a worsened mental status since the MCS (4010 vs 4110), VSI (5520 vs 56 19) and PH15 scores (8 4 vs 84;all p=ns) were unchanged between T1 and T2. On the contrary, at T2 most patients resumed their routinely work (57% vs 19%, p<0.05). Conclusions: Our survey showed an unforeseen improvement of IBS symptoms during the first Italian lockdown without a nega-tive impact on patients QoL. However, during the second COVID-19 wave, we observed an inverted trend with a new clinical worsen-ing associated with the return to patients pre-pandemic routine.

In Haiti, the 2019 dog vaccination campaign did not include the capital city, and the 2020 campaign was cancelled because of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and redirection of funds. We estimated the number of human lives that could be saved by resuming dog vaccination in 2021 compared to 2022 and compared the cost-effectiveness of these two scenarios. METHODS: We modified a previously published rabies transmission and economic model to estimate trends in dog and human rabies cases in Haiti from 2005-2025. We compared model outputs to surveillance data on human rabies deaths from 2005-2020 and animal rabies cases from 2018-2020. We then estimated the human health and cost implications of restarting dog vaccination programs in either 2021 or 2022. FINDINGS: Model predictions and animal surveillance data from Haiti both suggest a 5- to 8-fold increase in animal rabies cases has occurred in the capital city between Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. We estimate that restarting dog vaccination in Haiti in 2021 compared to 2022 could save 285 human lives and prevent 6,541 human rabies exposures over a five-year period and may decrease program costs due to reduced need for human post-exposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: A one-year delay in resuming dog vaccination in Haiti, from 2021 to 2022, could cost hundreds of lives over the next 5 years.

We first show that ILC2s are activated but are not required to handle acute illness after respiratory viral infection. In contrast, we find that this type of infection also activates ILC2s chronically for IL-13 production and consequent asthma-like disease traits that peak and last long after active viral infection is cleared. However, to manifest this type of disease, the Csf1-dependent myeloid-macrophage lineage is also active at two levels: first, at a downstream level, this lineage provides lung tissue macrophages (interstitial macrophages and tissue monocytes) that represent a major site of Il13 gene expression in the diseased lung; and second, at an upstream level, this same lineage is required for Il33 gene induction that is necessary to activate ILC2s for participation in disease at all, including IL-13 production.

Gasification resulted in lower yields of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) compared to direct combustion. A two-stage process, including gasification followed by syngas combustion, reduced the emissions of HCl and PCDD/F in the flue gas to <1.4% and <0.2%, respectively, compared to the levels from direct combustion of the PR feedstock. Most of the PCDD/F (>99%) was captured along with particulate matter (soot) during gasification. The contribution to the toxic concentration of PCDD/F was mainly from the PCDF congeners.

METHODS We undertook a prospective audit in a single dialysis unit. All patients were established on a simple anticoagulation protocol for at least 1 month prior to the audit. Blood anti-Xa activity was measured at time 0, 30, 60 and 120 min into and at the end of HD. Efficacy and safety data were collected on the study day and the two sessions before and after it. RESULTS Fifty-two patients were included in the efficacy and safety analysis with 43 patients undergoing anti-Xa analysis (9 sampling errors). Using current consensus (an end-HD anti-Xa activity of <0.4 IU/ml), our fixed-dose protocol resulted in satisfactory safety in all patients tested. Of 260 HD sessions, 10 (4%) had reduced tinzaparin efficacy. During 105 dialysis sessions (21 patients) using an arteriovenous fistula, 4 patients had one episode of minor bleeding and there were 6 episodes (2 patients) of post-needle-compression time greater than 15 min.

Methods We employed population-wide electronic health records (EHRs; from 1998-2020) consisting of almost 4 million adults to assess regional variations in disease burden of five liver conditions, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), autoimmune liver disease, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV), chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) and NAFLD, in England. We analysed regional differences in incidence rates for 17 manifestations of CVD in people with or without liver disease. The associations between biomarkers and comorbidities and risk of CVD in patients with liver disease were estimated using Cox models. For each liver condition, we estimated excess years of life lost (YLL) attributable to CVD (i.e., difference in YLL between people with or without CVD). Results The age-standardised incidence rate for any liver disease was 114.5 per 100,000 person years. The highest incidence was observed in NAFLD (85.5), followed by ALD (24.7), HCV (6.0), HBV (4.1) and autoimmune liver disease (3.7). Regionally, the North West and North East regions consistently exhibited high incidence burden. Age-specific incidence rate analyses revealed that the peak incidence for liver disease of non-viral aetiology is reached in individuals aged 50-59 years. Patients with liver disease had a 2-fold higher incidence burden of CVD (2,634.6 per 100,000 persons) compared to individuals without liver disease (1,339.7 per 100,000 persons). When comparing across liver diseases, atrial fibrillation was the most common initial CVD presentation while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the least common. We noted strong positive associations between body mass index and current smoking and risk of CVD. Patients who also had diabetes, hypertension, proteinuric kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, diverticular disease and gastro-oesophageal reflex disorders had a higher risk of CVD, as do patients with low albumin, raised C-reactive protein and raised International Normalized Ratio levels. All types of CVD were associated with shorter life expectancies. When evaluating excess YLLs by age of CVD onset and by liver disease type, differences in YLLs, when comparing across CVD types, were more pronounced at younger ages. Conclusions We developed a public online app (https://lailab.shinyapps.io/cvd_in_liver_disease/) to showcase results interactively. We provide a blueprint that revealed previously underappreciated clinical factors related to the risk of CVD, which differed in the magnitude of effects across liver diseases. We found significant geographical variations in the burden of liver disease and CVD, highlighting the need to devise local solutions. Targeted policies and regional initiatives addressing underserved communities might help improve equity of access to CVD screening and treatment.","output":"Increased burden of cardiovascular disease in people with liver disease: unequal geographical variations, risk factors and excess years of life lost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite efforts to develop effective treatments and vaccines, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), particularly pulmonary Mtb, continues to provide major health challenges worldwide. To improve immunization against the persistent health challenge of Mtb infection, we have studied the CD8+ T cell response to Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) and recombinant BCG (rBCG) in mice. Here, we generated CD8+ T cells with an rBCG-based vaccine encoding the Ag85B protein of M. kansasii, termed rBCG-Mkan85B, followed by boosting with plasmid DNA expressing the Ag85B gene (DNA-Mkan85B). We identified two MHC-I (H2-Kd )-restricted epitopes that induce cross-reactive responses to Mtb and other related mycobacteria in both BALB/c (H2d ) and CB6F1 (H2b/d ) mice. The H2-Kd -restricted peptide epitopes elicited polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses that were also highly cross-reactive with those of other proteins of the Ag85 complex. Tetramer staining indicated that the two H2-Kd -restricted epitopes elicit distinct CD8+ T cell populations, a result explained by the X-ray structure of the two peptide/H2-Kd complexes. These results suggest that rBCG-Mkan85B vector-based immunization and DNA-Mkan85B boost may enhance CD8+ T cell response to Mtb, and might help to overcome the limited effectiveness of the current BCG in eliciting tuberculosis immunity.","output":"MHC-restricted Ag85B-specific CD8+ T cells are enhanced by recombinant BCG prime and DNA boost immunization in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More timely, accurate, and relevant data and methodological innovation could exploit the full power of modelling, argue Feng Chen and colleagues","output":"Better modelling of infectious diseases: lessons from covid-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Employee welfare represents a critical element of success for companies to remain competitive.

CBT-I is the guideline-recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but availability of CBT-I therapists is limited. Somryst addresses this need by providing asynchronous access to CBT-I treatment. As a contactless therapeutic medium, Somryst is also an ideal option when face-to-face therapy is not available or recommended for safety reasons (e.g., because of possible exposure to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus). Areas covered: PDTs are the first class of software-based medical devices FDA-cleared and available via mobile applications. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and technical features of Somryst, and describes safety and effectiveness data from the randomized trials on which FDA clearance was based.

Real World evidence based on large MS registry data suggests the superiority of early HE DMT over a slow treatment escalation approach; delaying HE DMT leads to more rapid and often irreversible disability accrual. Mechanistically, B-cell depletion, particularly memory B-cell suppression, is a common denominator closely associated with DMT efficacy. SUMMARY The concept that HE DMTs are necessarily associated with a high risk of adverse effects, is no longer supported by the evidence.

This study analyzes the true impact of RL length by comparing the long-term outcomes of proximal RYGB (PRYGB) and very-very long limb RYGB (VVLL-RYGB). METHODS RL length in PRYGB was 150 cm. In VVLL-RYGB, common channel length was 100 cm. In both groups, biliopancreatic limbs measured 50-60 cm, resulting in equal total alimentary limb lengths. To adjust for pre-operative differences between groups, and to predict the long-term outcome, a mixed model analysis was performed. RESULTS Two hundred thirty-two patients with VVLL-RYGB (73.7% female, mean age 41.1  10 years, initial BMI 45.8  6.3 kg/m2) and 223 with PRYGB (83.9% female, mean age 38.5  11 years, initial BMI 42.9  4.9 kg/m2) were included. Mean follow-up was 9.4  4 years in VVLL-RYGB and 5.3  1.9 years in PRYGB. After 5 years, mean BMI reduction was 15.7  5.9 kg/m2 in VVLL-RYGB and 11.9  4.1 kg/m2 in PRYGB (p < 0.001), and mean %EWL was 78.3  23.1% and 70.2  23.7% (p = 0.002) with a follow-up rate of 78% and 75.9%, respectively.

However, daily vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021?; vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy (4). A cohort study of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated residents (5), but no studies comparing mortality rates within the general population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have been conducted. To assess mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during December 2020-July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites. After standardizing mortality rates by age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons.

METHODS: An expert panel created a survey, which was circulated twice (in April and May 2020) to members of the Paediatric Assembly of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and via the social media of the ERS. The survey stratified patients by the following conditions: asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and other respiratory conditions. RESULTS: In total 174 centres responded to at least one survey. 80 centres reported no cases, whereas 94 entered data from 945 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from 49 children with asthma of whom 29 required no treatment, 19 needed supplemental oxygen and four children required mechanical ventilation. Of the 14 children with CF and COVID-19, 10 required no treatment and four had only minor symptoms.

Conclusion: In our research, various suggestions were made for indoor and outdoor activities that can be done at home and in rural recreation areas in these and similar situations, and it was tried to help individuals to maintain the continuity of physical activity behaviors and to develop health-related physical fitness elements.","output":"Recommendations for Improving Physical Activity and Health-Related Physical Fitness Elements During Pandemic Periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to every country around the world taking on pandemic proportions Since March 8th, 2020, the Italian government ordered a nationwide lockdown with unavoidable social isolation Healthcare professionals (HCPs) represent the most physically and emotionally involved category The aim of this study is to assess the social distress among HCPs in Italy Methods In this online, totally anonymous survey, 24 multiple choice questions were posed to medical staff employed in the Italian healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic Data collection was performed from 30th March to 24th April 2020 Results A total of 600 HCPs completed the questionnaire The majority of respondents expressed the fear of being at higher risk of contagion than the general population (83 3%) and the weighty concern of infecting their families (72 5%) An insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (p = 0 0003) and inadequate training about procedures to follow (p = 0 0092) was seen to significantly coincide with these worries More than two thirds declared a change in family organisation showing a significant correlation with the concern of infecting their relatives (p &lt; 0 0001) Discussion This is the first Italian survey on social distress among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic The unavailability of personal protective equipment, screening procedures and adequate training strongly affected HCPs emotional status Although there was a predominance of oncologists (especially from the North of Italy) which impairs the generalisation of our findings, this survey underlined the social impact that this health emergency has had on HCPs","output":"Social distress among Medical Oncologists and other Health Care Professionals during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With both cost and safety taken into account in the context of the life-threatening COVID-19 pandemic globally, rural tourism is expected to be the top choice for Chinese residents for relaxation and enhancing parent-child relationships. In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists' intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together.","output":"How to Influence Rural Tourism Intention by Risk Knowledge during COVID-19 Containment in China: Mediating Role of Risk Perception and Attitude"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has generated restrictions in the mobility of people, affecting the face-to-face care of patients with chronic diseases, including autoimmune. The health emergency has created the need to establish follow-up alternatives, giving rise to telemedicine. Objectives: To evaluate the level of attendance to teleconsultation and the faceto-face usual care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who underwent to a developed innovative telemedicine program after the declaration of quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from patients with RA and SLE from March to June, 2020;. Since the beginning of March 2020 when Covid-19 was declared in Colombia as a health emergency establishing specific standards for outpatient care, our center has made the necessary legal and technical adjustments to develop an innovative telemedicine service to prevent the epidemiological risk. To all contacted patients were offered the option of teleconsultation or face-to-face consultation;a standardized protocol was set with clinimetry measures evaluated in both groups. Continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables were described using numbers and percentages. We performed chi-square tests of independence to determine differences between teleconsulting and conventional face-to-face consultation. Results: A total of 5745 RA patients were followed-up, 5292 (92.1%) by teleconsulting and 453 (7.9%) by conventional face-to-face consultation;among the group of SLE patients, a total of 646 were assessed, of which there were 386 (60%) by teleconsultation and 260 (40%) by face-to-face consultation;this highlights an important difference in the level of acceptance of the teleconsultation between patients with RA and SLE, being much lower in patients with SLE (p value< 0.0001). Regarding gender differences, in men, there were 33 (12.7%) SLE and 89 (19.6%) RA face-to-face consultations, while in women there were 227 (87.3%) SLE and 364 (80.4%) RA in a face-to-face consultation. Regarding patients who were attended through telemedicine, 45 (11.7%) SLE and 966 (18.3%) RA were men, while 341 (88.3%) SLE and 4326 (81.7%) RA were women;that means, in the RA cohort, a greater number of men prefer the faceto-face consultation than in the SLE cohort (p value< 0.0185). 10 RA patients were diagnosed with the Covid-19 in teleconsultation;in all cases, close contact with infected relatives was verified as the probable cause. Conclusion: Telemedicine may provide a viable option for the follow-up of patients with rheumatological diseases even beyond the pandemic. But unexpectedly, data showed an important difference in the acceptance of teleconsultation between patients with RA and SLE, being much higher in older and/or male patients with RA compared to patients with SLE;however, further studies are needed to support this conclusion.","output":"Unexpected difference in acceptance of teleconsultation between patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis who underwent to a developed and implemented telemedicine innovative program after the declaration of quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-term effects of COVID-19, also called Long COVID, affect more than 10% of patients. The most severe cases (i.e. those requiring hospitalization) present a higher frequency of sequelae, but detailed information on these effects is still lacking. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the frequency and outcomes associated with the presence of sequelae or persistent symptomatology (SPS) during the 6 months after discharge for COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective observational 6-month follow-up study conducted in four hospitals of Spain. A cohort of all 969 patients who were hospitalized with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to April 15, 2020, was included. We collected all the SPS during the 6 months after discharge reported by patients during follow-up from primary care records. Cluster analyses were performed to validate the measures. The main outcome measures were return to the Emergency Services, hospital readmission and post-discharge death. Surviving patients' outcomes were collected through clinical histories and primary care reports. Multiple logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: The 797 (82.2%) patients who survived constituted the sample followed, while the rest died from COVID-19. The mean age was 63.0 years, 53.7% of them were men and 509 (63.9%) reported some sequelae during the first 6 months after discharge. These sequelae were very diverse, but the most frequent were respiratory (42.0%), systemic (36.1%), neurological (20.8%), mental health (12.2%) and infectious (7.9%) SPS, with some differences by sex. Women presented higher frequencies of headache and mental health SPS, among others. A total of 160 (20.1%) patients returned to the Emergency Services, 35 (4.4%) required hospital readmission and 8 (1.0%) died during follow-up. The main factors independently associated with the return to Emergency Services were persistent fever, dermatological SPS, arrythmia or palpitations, thoracic pain and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the first wave of the pandemic developed a significant range of mid- to long-term SPS. A detailed list of symptoms and outcomes is provided in this multicentre study.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study in a sample of 1,402 senior high school students; students were asked to complete a questionnaire which comprised the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) to assess the QoL, the Self-rating Scale of Systemic Family Dynamics (SSFD) for assessing family functioning, the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) for assessing mental health and general demographic variables. RESULTS: Grades of senior high school students were defined as Grade 1 (first year), Grade 2 (second year), and Grade 3 (third year). Compared to Grade 3 students, Grade 1 students had higher scores in physical functioning, role-emotional, bodily pain, and reported health transition of the QoL over the last 1 year (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression showed that the place of residence, subscales of systemic family dynamics, somatization, and depression significantly affected the total QoL score.

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis.

However, based on observational studies and randomized controlled trials, beneficial effects of CCP were limited, and its use was virtually discontinued early in 2021, in concurrence with increased vaccination rates and availability of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. However, as new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spread, interest in CCP derived from vaccine-boosted CCP donors is resurging. The effect of vaccination of previously infected CCP donors on antibodies against rapidly spreading variants of concern (VOC) is still under investigation. Study Design/Methods: In this study, paired samples from 11 CCP donors collected before and after vaccination were tested to measure binding antibodies levels and neutralization activity against the ancestral and SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, D614G, B.1.617.2, B.1.427) on the Ortho Vitros Spike Total Ig and IgG assays, the MSD V-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 Panel 6 arrays for IgG binding and ACE2 inhibition, and variant-specific Spike Reporter Viral Particle Neutralization (RVPN) assays. Results/Findings: Binding and neutralizing antibodies were significantly boosted by vaccination, with several logs higher neutralization for all the variants tested post-vaccination compared to the pre-vaccination samples, with no difference found among the individual variants. Discussion: Vaccination of previously infected individuals boosts antibodies including neutralizing activity against all SARS-CoV-2 VOC, including the current spreading delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Animal model and human studies to assess clinical efficacy of vaccine boosted CCP are warranted, especially since 15-20% of current donations in the US are from previously infected vaccine-boosted donors.","output":"Vaccination of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donors Increases Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern livestock production became highly intensive and large scaled to increase production efficiency. This production environment could add stressors affecting the health and growth of animals. Major stressors can include environment (air quality and temperature), nutrition, and infection. These stressors can reduce growth performance and alter immune systems at systemic and local levels including the gastrointestinal tract. Heat stress increases the permeability, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in the gut. Nutritional stress from fasting, antinutritional compounds, and toxins induces the leakage and destruction of the tight junction proteins in the gut. Fasting is shown to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas deoxynivalenol increases the recruitment of intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines and the level of lymphocytes in the gut. Pathogenic and viral infections such as Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus can lead to loosening the intestinal epithelial barrier. On the other hand, supplementation of Lactobacillus or Saccharaomyces reduced infectious stress by ETEC. It was noted that major stressors altered the permeability of intestinal barriers and profiles of genes and proteins of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mucosal system in pigs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Hyperoxic lung injured mice were used as the disease model. Pulmonary fibrosis was determined by H&E and Masson's staining. Autophagy was investigated by western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. KEY FINDINGS We observed that increased CX3CR1 expression corresponded with increased pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, silencing of CX3CR1 significantly alleviated the fibrosis when compared to the control. We observed that exposure of mouse to hyperoxic environment increased macrophage levels along with an increased CD11b expression in the lung tissues. Subsequently, we also observed an increased expression of LC3-II and decreased p62 expression in hyperoxic mice models, suggesting the potential role of hyperoxia induced autophagy. CD11b and LC3/CX3CR1 were expressed and co-localized in a manner indicating CX3CR1 indeed does regulate macrophage autophagy in the hyperoxic lung injury model. We observed a decrease in hyperoxia-associated fibrosis, along with a decrease in autophagy when we used 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) in our hyperoxic lung injury model. To elucidate the pathway through which CX3CR1 regulated autophagy, we further analyzed the Akt1 pathway. Our experimental results indicated that the Akt1 inhibitor (A-674563) did significantly decrease macrophage autophagy and fibrosis in hyperoxic mice models.

However, with the unilateral thoracic approach, it can be difficult to ensure the operative field in the neck and difficult to identify the location of the contralateral phrenic nerve. In 2015, we reported on a robotic subxiphoid thymectomy (RST) in which the camera is inserted from the subxiphoid incision and robotic forceps are inserted from the bilateral intercostal spaces. With this approach, a camera is inserted into a subxiphoid incision which is the midline of the body and a surgical field comparable to that in a median sternotomy can be achieved. This makes it easier to identify the location of the bilateral phrenic nerves and offer the good visualization in the neck area. Here we report on our RST techniques. For a thymectomy without suturing, a subxiphoid, single-port thymectomy is performed because it is minimally invasive. In patients who require suturing, such as with a pericardial patch closure, RST is selected.

We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged &#8805;18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time. RESULTS: 17a??282a??905 adults were included, of whom 27a??480 (016%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14a??882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 290 (95% CI 196-430; p<00001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 259 (95% CI 174-384; p<00001).

Since 1997, several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered: influenza A viruses H5N1 and H1N1, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses SARS, NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, human rhinoviruses C and D and potential respiratory pathogens, the KI and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus. The detection of previously known viruses has also improved. Currently, a viral cause of respiratory illness is almost exclusively identifiable in children, but in the elderly, the detection rates of a viral etiology are below 40%, and this holds also true for exacerbations of chronic respiratory illnesses. The new viruses cause respiratory symptoms like the common cold, cough, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure may occur. These viruses are distributed throughout the globe and affect people of all ages. Data regarding these viruses and the elderly are scarce. This review introduces these new viruses and reviews their clinical significance, especially with regard to the elderly population.","output":"New Respiratory Viruses and the Elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinct SARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/or vaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediated response is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responses against SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories, including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, the variant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and that individuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposure exhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that the interplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape the antigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future vaccine design. Author Summary Neutralising antibodies provide protection against viruses and are generated because of vaccination or prior infections. The main target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies is a protein called Spike, which decorates the viral particle and mediates viral entry into cells. As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, mutations accumulate in the spike protein, allowing the virus to escape antibody-mediated immunity and decreasing vaccine effectiveness. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants have appeared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing various waves of infection through the population and infecting-in some cases-people that had been previously infected or vaccinated. Since the antibody response is highly specific, individuals infected with different variants are likely to have different repertoires of neutralising antibodies. We studied the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants using sera from vaccinated people as well as from people infected with different variants. We show that potency of the antibody response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants depends on the particular variant that infected each person, the exposure type (infection or vaccination) and the number and order of exposures. Our study provides insight into the interplay between virus evolution and immunity, as well as important information for the development of better vaccination strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth and potency of antibody-mediated immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reportamos el caso de un adolescente varn de 11 a?os, con clnica de MISC-PIMS, RT-PCR negativa y serologa negativa para COVID-19, contacto familiar RT-PCR positiva para COVID-19, atendido en un centro hospitalario referencial, recibiendo tratamiento estandarizado para MIS-C, sin respuesta a la teraputica inicial, a pesar de recibir en 3 oportunidades el mismo esquema, catalogado como refractario, por lo que se decide estudio ampliado para otras entidades;encontrndose Linfohistiocitosis hemofagoctica asociada a Lupus eritematoso sistmico, entidad que muchas veces comparten marcadores inflamatorios similares con el MISC, inclusive usualmente confundida con entidades reumatolgicas, hematolgicas y neoplsicas, por eso la importancia de reportar el caso para identificar este grupo refractario al tratamiento e identificar otra enfermedad con estudio ampliado, ya que podra ser perjudicial hasta inclusive mortal si no se obtiene un diagnostico definitivo.","output":"LA LINFOHISTIOCITOSIS HEMOFAGOCTICA SECUNDARIA A LUPUS SISTEMICO CON CLINICA DE MIS-C REFRACTARIO EN NI?OS: REPORTE DE CASO (preprint)/ pt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to clarify the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer surgery in Gunma Prefecture.

Specifically, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a large number of people with respective enrollments meeting an exponential growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only a small number of enrolled learners successfully complete their studies creating an interest in early prediction of dropout. This paper presents the findings of a study conducted during a MOOC for smart city professionals, in which we analyzed demographic and personal information on their own and in tandem with a small set of interaction data between learners and the MOOC, in order to identify factors influencing the decision of starting the MOOC or not. We also applied different models for predicting whether a person previously registered to a MOOC will eventually start it or not, as well as for identifying the most informative attributes for the prediction process. Results show that prediction reached 85% accuracy based only on the number of the first days logins in the MOOC and few demographic data such as current job role or occupation and number of study hours that the learner estimates he/she can devote on a weekly basis.

A timely example of such a challenge is to retrieve the subset of papers that report on immune signatures (coherent sets of biomarkers) to understand the immune response mechanisms which drive differential SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. A systematic and scalable approach is needed to identify and extract COVID-19 immune signatures in a structured and machine-readable format. Materials and MethodsWe used SPECTER embeddings with SVM classifiers to automatically identify papers containing immune signatures. A generic web platform was used to manually screen papers and allow anonymous submission. ResultsWe demonstrate a classifier that retrieves papers with human COVID-19 immune signatures with a positive predictive value of 86%. Semi-automated queries to the corresponding authors of these publications requesting signature information achieved a 31% response rate. This demonstrates the efficacy of using a SVM classifier with document embeddings of the abstract and title, to retrieve papers with scientifically salient information, even when that information is rarely present in the abstract. Additionally, classification based on the embeddings identified the type of immune signature (e.g., gene expression vs. other types of profiling) with a positive predictive value of 74%. ConclusionCoupling a classifier based on document embeddings with direct author engagement offers a promising pathway to build a semistructured representation of scientifically relevant information.

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens. These findings may indicate that non-citizens and less educated individuals may be less attentive to preventive measures.

Despite this, no previous study has amalgamated the data on noise across all OHNS ORs to determine how much noise is present during OHNS surgeries. This study aims to review all the literature on noise associated with OHNS ORs and procedures. METHODS Ovid Medline, EMBASE Classic, Pubmed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases were searched following PRISMA guidelines. Data was collected on noise measurement location and surgery type. Descriptive results and statistical analysis were completed using Stata. RESULTS This search identified 2914 articles. Final inclusion consisted of 22 studies. The majority of articles analyzed noise level exposures during mastoid surgery (18/22, 82%). The maximum noise level across all OHNS ORs and OHNS cadaver studies were 95.5 a-weighted decibels (dBA) and 106.6 c-weighted decibels (dBC), respectively (P = 0.2068). The mean noise level across all studies was significantly higher in OHNS cadaver labs (96.9 dBA) compared to OHNS ORs (70.1 dBA) (P = 0.0038).

METHODS: Participants in the study were 2349 university students with a mean age of 23 years (M = 23.15, SD = 4.66). There was a predominance of women (69.26%) and individuals studying at the bachelor level (78%). The research was conducted between May and July 2020 in nine countries: Slovenia (n=209), the Czech Republic (Czechia)(n=308), Germany (n=267), Poland (n=301), Ukraine (n=310), Russia (n=285), Turkey (n=310), Israel (n=199), and Colombia (n=153). Participants completed an online survey involving measures of satisfaction with life (SWLS), exposure to COVID-19, perceived negative impact of coronavirus (PNIC) on students' well-being, general self-reported health (GSRH), physical activity (PA), and some demographics (gender, place of residence, level of study). A one-way ANOVA was used to explore cross-national differences in life satisfaction. The (2) independence test was performed separately in each country to examine associations between life satisfaction and other variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify life satisfaction predictors among a set of demographic and health-related variables in each of the nine countries. RESULTS: The level of life satisfaction varied between university students from the nine countries. The results for life satisfaction and the other variables differed between countries. Numerous associations were noted between satisfaction with life and several variables, and these showed cross-national differences. Distinct predictors of life satisfaction were observed for each country. However, poor self-rated physical health was a predictor of low life satisfaction independent of the country.

The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and host surface receptor protein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), prior to cellular entry. Hence, blocking at the initial stage of virus entry could be a promising strategy/therapy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many drugs as SARS-CoV-2 blocker have been proposed. Among them, peptide-based antivirals are one. This Viewpoint discusses the potential antiviral role and feasibility of two classes of peptides for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, where (1) a designed peptide (replication of virus binding domain of hACE2), and (2) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; natural and first line host defense peptide), both may reduce virus load into the host cell by blocking cellular surface receptors and/or disruption of virus cell membrane at the stage of virus entry. These finding may provide a novel antiviral therapy against COVID-19, which might control the current global health crisis.","output":"Potential Role of Peptide-Based Antiviral Therapy Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The penetration of e-mobility is growing thanks to the European guidelines on climate preservation regarding the reduction in CO2 emission. Governments are adapting their economic policies with the aim to incentivize e-mobility. At the same time, with a view to equality and accessibility, countries are working to introduce e-mobility services also for people with disabilities in order to improve the quality of their lives. The paper reports the deployment of an e-mobility service for persons with disabilities carried out in a project financed by Sapienza University of Rome. The project includes a feasibility study and a costCbenefit analysis in order to identify the optimal solution from a technical and environmental point of view for a sustainable e-mobility service for people with reduced mobility. A methodology to design a service based on optimal routes and electric vehicles with respect to energy consumption, time travel, energy and vehicle costs and quality of service is proposed. The 5-step methodology calculates the most energy-efficient routes and defines the optimal charging schedule, taking into account charging points dislocated along the routes and choosing vehicle typologies with the best performance based on economic evaluations.

The measures were widely believed to increase women's risk of violent victimization, most of which is by an intimate partner. We examined help-seeking during this period in a large U.S. city and used an interrupted time series analysis to assess the effects of three government interventions on domestic violence and sexual assault hotline calls and on \\"911\\" calls regarding domestic violence, assault, and rape. Declaration of an emergency appeared to reduce victim calls to the rape crisis hotline and the few \\"911\\" calls about rape. School closure was associated with a reduction in \\"911\\" calls about assault and rape and victim calls to the domestic violence hotline. Implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although \\"911\\" calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes over time in violence against women.

Therefore, we followed and examined COVID-19-related rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, including fact-checking agency websites, Facebook, Twitter, and online newspapers, and their impacts on public health. Information was extracted between December 31, 2019 and April 5, 2020, and descriptively analyzed. We performed a content analysis of the news articles to compare and contrast data collected from other sources. We identified 2,311 reports of rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in 25 languages from 87 countries.

RESULTS: An estimated 15%C46% of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infections are asymptomatic. The reported mean incubation period is 3 to 7 days with a range of 1C14 days. The blood phase of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 appears to be brief and low level, with RNAaemia detectable in only a small proportion of patients, typically associated with more severe disease and not demonstrated to be infectious virus. An asymptomatic blood phase has not been demonstrated. Given these characteristics of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and the absence of reported transfusion transmission (TT), the TT risk is currently theoretical. To mitigate any potential TT risk, but more importantly to prevent respiratory transmission in donor centres, blood centres can implement donor deferral policies based on travel, disease status or potential risk of exposure.

Here, we retrospectively evaluated and integrated laboratory parameters of 45 elderly subjects from a long-term care facility with Sars-CoV-2 outbreak and spread, to identify potential common patterns of systemic response able to better stratify patients clinical course and outcome. METHODS: Baseline white blood cells, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets counts, hemoglobin, total iron, ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 concentration were used to generate a principal component analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by using R statistical package version 4.0. RESULTS: We identified 3 laboratory patterns of response, renamed as low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk, strongly associated with patients survival (p < 0.01). D-dimer, iron status, lymphocyte/monocyte count represented the main markers discriminating high- and low-risk groups.

For the first problem increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve ODC) is of advantage, for the 2nd, however, the contrary is the case. Indeed a right shift of the ODC has been found in former studies for anemia caused by reduced cell production or hemolysis. This resulted from increased 2,3-biphosphglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. In 3 investigations in COVID-19, however, no change of hemoglobin affinity was detected in spite of probably high [2,3-BPG]. The most plausible cause for this finding is formation of methemoglobin, which increases the oxygen affinity and thus apparently compensates for the 2,3-BPG effect. But this \\"useful effect\\" is cancelled by the concomitant reduction of functional hemoglobin. In the largest study on COVID-19 even a clear left shift of the ODC was detected when calculated from measurements in fresh blood rather than after equilibration with gases outside the body. This additional \\"in vivo\\" left shift possibly results from various factors (e. g. concentration changes of Cl-, 2,3-BPG, ATP, lactate, nitrocompounds, glutathione, glutamate, because of time delay between blood sampling and end of equilibration, or enlarged distribution space including interstitial fluid and is useful for O2 uptake in the lungs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this online survey was to assess the changes and current status of rheumatology departments and practices in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient operations. Questions addressed the following issues: characteristics of the department, impact on patient care, application of recommendations, personal protective equipment (PPE), and organizational adaptations to the new framework conditions. The survey was available for 14 days and closed on 3 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 66 complete answers were recorded and evaluated. In the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 crisis the proportion of outpatients in the institutions decreased on average by ?40.6%. The number of outpatients receiving infusions decreased by ?25.6%. Of the inpatient facilities 81% reported an average decrease of hospitalized patients of ?54.9% and 52% of the participants complained of a lack of PPE. Organizational adjustments are reported.

There is no question that the current global COVID-19 crisis, now more than ever, is underscoring the importance of leveraging digital approaches to optimize pediatric health care delivery in the era of this pandemic. In this perspective piece, we highlight some of the available digital approaches that have been and can continue to be used to streamline remote pediatric patient care in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to telemedicine. JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting is currently publishing a COVID-19 special theme issue in which investigators can share their interim and final research data related to digital approaches to remote pediatric health care delivery in different settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care systems worldwide, with significant variations and innovations in adaptation. There has been rapid expansion of the leveraging and optimization of digital approaches to health care delivery, particularly integrated telemedicine and virtual health. Digital approaches have played and will play major roles as invaluable and reliable resources to overcome restrictions and challenges imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to increase access to effective, accessible, and consumer-friendly care for more patients and families. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, and further research is needed. Optimizing digital approaches to health care delivery and integrating them into the public health response will be an ongoing process during the current COVID-19 outbreak and during other possible future pandemics. Regulatory changes are essential to support the safe and wide adoption of these approaches. Involving all relevant stakeholders in addressing current and future challenges as well as logistical, technological, and financial barriers will be key for success. Future studies should consider evaluating the following research areas related to telemedicine and other digital approaches: cost-effectiveness and return on investment; impact on quality of care; balance in use and number of visits needed for the management of both acute illness and chronic health conditions; system readiness for further adoption in other settings, such as inpatient services, subspecialist consultations, and rural areas; ongoing user-centered evaluations, with feedback from patients, families, and health care providers; strategies to optimize health equity and address disparities in access to care related to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and rural communities; privacy and security concerns for protected health information with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-secured programs; confidentiality issues for some specific populations, especially adolescents and those in need of mental health services; early detection of exposure to violence and child neglect; and integration of training into undergraduate and graduate medical education and subspecialty fellowships. Addressing these research areas is essential to understanding the benefits, sustainability, safety, and optimization strategies of telemedicine and other digital approaches as key parts of modern health care delivery. These efforts will inform long-term adoption of these approaches with expanded dissemination and implementation efforts.","output":"Digital Approaches to Remote Pediatric Health Care Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Existing Evidence and a Call for Further Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative stress caused by free radicals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBDCACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between CoV-2 or CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 110 pN, and are 30-50% higher than those of CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the CoV-1 RBDCACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After the removal of N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the CoV-1 RBDCACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 receptor-binding domain and human ACE2.

Most subjects had upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), while lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) occurred in three children (7%), one complicated by respiratory failure requiring ventilation support. All patients recovered. Nasopharyngeal aspirates tested for HPIV-4 were positive by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in all 41 cases (100%), by direct immunofluorescence in 29 of 39 tested cases (74%), and by cell cultures in 6 of 37 cases (16%), and serum was positive for antibodies against HPIV-4 in all 35 cases (100%) with serum samples available. In addition, RT-PCR detected HPIV-4 in four children (three LRTI and one URTI) out of 115 patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infection. Molecular analysis of the 1,198-bp phosphoprotein sequences showed that HPIV-4 isolates among the cases were genetically similar, whereas the community controls were more genetically distant, supporting nosocomial transmission of a single HPIV-4 genotype during the outbreak. Moreover, the HPIV-4 causing the outbreak is more closely related to HPIV-4A than HPIV-4B. HPIV-4 may be an important cause of more severe respiratory illness in children.

Methods and findings: This work, part of the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study comparing patients with COVID-19 treated with ACEI/ARB during hospitalization to those not treated. The primary endpoint was incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis (IMV [Invasive Mechanical Ventilation], NIMV [Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation], ICU admission [Intensive Care Unit], and/or all-cause mortality). The secondary endpoint was incidence of MACE. We evaluated both outcomes in patients whose treatment with ACEI/ARB continued or was withdrawn during hospitalization. Between February and June 2020, 11,205 patients were included. The mean age was 67 years (SD=16.3) and 43.1% were female; 2,162 patients received ACEI/ARB treatment and 9,043 did not. ACEI/ARB treatment showed a protective effect on all-cause mortality (p<.0001), but was only protective in hypertensive patients in terms of IMV, ICU admission, and the composite outcome of prognosis (p<.0001 for all). No differences were found in incidence of MACE. Patients previously treated with ACEI/ARB who continued treatment during hospitalization had a lower incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis compared to those whose treatment was withdrawn (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.63-0.76). ARB had a more beneficial effect on survival than ACEI (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.96). The main study limitations include its retrospective, observational nature; the fact that treatment decisions were made by individual clinicians; and that treatment duration was not recorded. Conclusion: ACEI/ARB treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization was not shown to be harmful and indeed had a protective effect on mortality.

In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, females were 2.21 times more likely to have anxiety compared to males [AOR: 2.21; CI 95% (1.28C53.70); p-value: 0.004] and participants age was negatively associated with increased levels of anxiety (AOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05C0.57; p = 0.001). In addition, participants who were worried about academic delays were more anxious than those who were not worried about it (AOR: 2.82; 95% CI 1.50C5.31, p = 0.001). These findings of this study will add value to the existing limited evidence and strongly advocate in designing gender-specific, low-intensity interventions to ensure comprehensive mental health services for the young adult population of Bangladesh.","output":"Generalized anxiety disorder among Bangladeshi university students during COVID-19 pandemic: gender specific findings from a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies indicate that increasing self-awareness leads to individuals reflecting on their values and ideals (Silvia & Duval, 2001). This self-reflection appears to increase prosocial behaviour (Berkowitz, 1987). However, previously studies typically manipulated self-awareness in situations in which the individual may have felt pressure from the researcher to help. Thus, experimenter pressure to behave prosocially confounds the self-awareness explanation provided in past research. We used a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness and remove the researcher's presence to decrease the likelihood that the participant would conform to experimenter demand. Participants were 36 college students (Mage = 19.52; 25 women). The results indicated a strong probability that the experimental condition participants were more prosocial than control condition participants. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that self-reflection increases prosocial behaviour, even without experimenter demands.

Methods: From March 9 to April 24, 2020 we have retrospectively evaluated 62 patients who underwent elective surgery in the urology department of IRCCS Policlinico San Donato which became a COVID-hospital. We identified non-deferrable patients that needed to be treated within one month. All patients followed a dedicated pathway from the day-hospital till the discharge. Clinical data, nasopharyngeal swabs, chest X-ray, type of anaesthesia, surgical procedure and days of hospitalization were collected. All patients were interviewed 14 days after surgery to check any Covid-related complications. Results: The population included 48 (77.42%) men and 14 (22.58%) women, aged between 17 and 88 years old. We performed sixty-four (64) preoperative screenings and two (2) patients were excluded. 47 (75.81%) patients underwent oncological procedures while 15 (24.19%) patients underwent non-oncological surgery. The average hospitalization time was 2.392.21 days.After at least 14 postoperative days (25.0010.35 days), we interviewed all patients to check their conditions. No patients showed symptoms related to COVID-19, except for 2 (3.23%) who manifested coryza, 28 and 35 days after discharge respectively. Neither patients nor hospital workers developed COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The duration of pandemic period is undefined;therefore, our protocol could be considered a good model for every type of surgery and its application could ensure a continuous treatment for non-deferrable conditions, in a safe way for both the patients and health workers.","output":"Safety of urologic elective surgery in a Covid-hospital: our experience in Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: We present a complex case of a 56-year-old man with multiple left-sided rib pathology including nonunion, rib heterotopic ossification (HO) forming a rib-to-rib synostosis, and rib malunion.

Although transgenic rats that express the HIV-1 receptor complex hCD4 and hCCR5 are susceptible to infection, HIV-1 replicates very poorly in these animals. To demonstrate the molecular basis for developing a better rat model for HIV-1 infection, we evaluated the effect of human CyclinT1 (hCycT1) and CRM1 (hCRM1) on Gag p24 production in rat T cells and macrophages using both established cell lines and primary cells prepared from hCycT1/hCRM1 transgenic rats. RESULTS Expression of hCycT1 augmented Gag production 20-50 fold in rat T cells, but had little effect in macrophages. Expression of hCRM1 enhanced Gag production 10-15 fold in macrophages, but only marginally in T cells. Expression of both factors synergistically enhanced p24 production to levels approximately 10-40% of those detected in human cells. R5 viruses produced in rat T cells and macrophages were fully infectious.

Recently, remarkable progressions have been made in human-to-robot handovers of unknown objects by using learning-based grasp generators. However, how to responsively generate smooth motions to take an object from a human is still an open question. Specifically, planning motions that take human comfort into account is not a part of the human-robot handover process in most prior works. In this paper, we propose to generate smooth motions via an efficient model-predictive control (MPC) framework that integrates perception and complex domain-specific constraints into the optimization problem. We introduce a learning-based grasp reachability model to select candidate grasps which maximize the robot's manipulability, giving it more freedom to satisfy these constraints.

At the end of February, the outburst of the pandemic has hit hard on northern Italian's hospitals. As of today, no data have been published regarding the severity of respiratory failure of patients presenting to the Emergency Departments. Moreover, the outcome the patients forced to undergo Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) due to lack of Intensive Care resources is unknown. Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital (HPG23) of Bergamo is one of the largest hospitals in the Country, with an Emergency Department (ED) managing over 100,000 patients per year. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study based on chart review of patients presenting to the Emergency Department of HPG23 from 29/02/2020 to 10/03/2020 with a clinical condition highly suspicious for COVID-19 infection. Registration of admission rates, severity of respiratory failure (ARDS classification), need of respiratory support, SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and outcome of patients treated with a ventilatory support were registered on 10th of May 2020. FINDINGS: From 29/02 to 10/03 611 patients with a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were evaluated in our ED; 320 (52%) met the criteria for hospital admission and 99 (31%) needed to be immediately started on ventilatory support (81% CPAP, 7% NIPPV, 12% Invasive Mechanical Ventilation). Eighty-five (86%) of the 99 patients needing a ventilatory support eventually had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test on nasal-pharyngeal swab. Their median PO2/FiO2 ratio was 128 (IQR 85C168), with 23 patients (29.5%) classified as severe ARDS. Mortality rate as of 10th of May was 76.5%, ranging from 44.4% within patients <60 years old to 85% within those older than 60 years (p = 0.001). NIPPV/CPAP failure occurred in 91.5% of patients. INTERPRETATION: The population of patients suspected for COVID-19 infection presenting at our ED showed a very high rate of severe respiratory failure, with urgent need of a large amount of intensive care resources. Mortality rates of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 (76.5%) are similar to previously reported studies with similar population. CPAP/NIPPV could be a valid strategy to treat severely hypoxic patients that cannot be intubated in the ED due to lack of intensive care resources.

METHODS: Recruitment used school communication, community organisations and snowball sampling in South West England. Audio recorded online or phone individual/group semi-structured interviews were conducted in JulyCSepttember 2020 and lasted 30C60 min. Interviews focused on views towards social distancing, hand hygiene and testing. Framework analysis was performed on interview notes/transcripts. RESULTS: Participants were 15 staff, 20 parents and 17 students (11C16 years) from 14 diverse schools. Concerns about COVID-19 risk at school, especially to vulnerable individuals, were outweighed by perceived risks of missed learning. Some staff felt guilt around being a potential spreader by teaching multiple classes. Findings highlighted a wide variety of school COVID-19 mitigation measures being deployed due to ambiguous government guidance. Participants generally saw mitigation measures as an acceptable and pragmatic solution to the perceived impossibility of social distancing in crowded schools, although anticipated challenges changing habitual behaviour. Participants supported school COVID-19 testing but identified the need to consider data security and stigma around COVID-19 diagnosis. Staff were concerned about unintended consequences of risk-reduction strategies on student behaviour, learning and pastoral care, particularly for those with Special Educational Needs or mental health issues who may find the measures especially challenging, and resultant widening inequalities. CONCLUSION: Families and staff supported COVID-19 mitigation measures in schools and would welcome the roll out school COVID-19 testing. Clear messaging and engendering collective responsibility are important for compliance and success of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, schools and policy-makers should consider unintended consequences of measures, providing extra support for vulnerable students and those with additional needs, and consider ways to avoid widening educational and health inequalities. Findings demonstrate the acceptability of school COVID-19 infection control measures is likely to be influenced by the balance of risks and benefits to students.","output":"Reducing COVID-19 risk in schools: a qualitative examination of secondary school staff and family views and concerns in the South West of England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, plays an important role in host defense and innate immunity due to its broad antibacterial and antiviral properties.

A significant increase in serum hepcidin levels was found in DS, compared to controls and AD subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Hepcidin protein was visible in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus, meningeal macrophages and in the astrocytes close to the endothelium of blood vessels. Hepcidin co-localized with IL-6, indicating its anti-inflammatory properties. We found significant correlation between hypoferritinemia and elevated levels of serum hepcidin in AD and DS. Hepcidin can be transported via macrophages and the majority of the vesicular hepcidin enters the brain via a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB).

Research shows that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is the most successful measure to combat the virus and could also address its indirect consequences. However, vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and the WHO names this hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health. This study investigates the trend in positive attitudes towards vaccines across ten countries since a positive attitude is important. Furthermore, we investigate those variables related to having a positive attitude, as these factors could potentially increase the uptake of vaccines. We derive our text corpus from vaccine-related tweets, harvested in real-time from Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we derive the sentiment and emotions contained in the tweets to construct daily time-series data. We analyse a panel dataset spanning both the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1 February 2021 to 31 July 2021. To determine the relationship between several variables and the positive sentiment (attitude) towards vaccines, we run various models, including POLS, Panel Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variables estimations. Our results show that more information about vaccines safety and the expected side effects are needed to increase positive attitudes towards vaccines. Additionally, government procurement and the vaccine rollout should improve. Accessibility to the vaccine should be a priority, and a collective effort should be made to increase positive messaging about the vaccine, especially on social media. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the emotional challenges associated with vaccine uptake and inform policymakers, health workers, and stakeholders who communicate to the public during infectious disease outbreaks.

As COVID-19 is studied, new data are emerging regarding the risk of severe coronavirus infection in patients with 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 1-Antitrypsin is the main inhibitor and key endogenous regulator of the serine leukocyte proteinase activitry released from the granules of activated neutrophils to the cell surface and into the extracellular space. It has been established that the number of cases of severe course and death of COVID-19 in the territories of 68 countries of the world correlates with the frequency of the spread of mutations in the proteinase inhibitor gene among the population of these countries, at which the concentration of 1-antitrypsin in the human blood plasma is 10 times lower than normal. All this contributes to the revision of a number of provisions of the pathogenesis and therapy of a new coronavirus infection. The review presents an analysis of the literature on the role of an inhibitor of serine leukocyte proteinases in protecting the body from COVID-19. The participation of 1-antitrypsin in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 penetration into the respiratory tract epithelial cells, in the protection of the vascular endothelium, blood plasma proteins and elastin of the lung tissue from the damaging effect of leukocyte elastase released during neutrophil degranulation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is considered. The role of 1-antitrypsin in suppressing inflammation by limiting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil extracellular traps into the blood has been shown.

Mumbai was amongst the first cities to see the increase. In this report, we use our agent based simulator to computationally study the second wave in Mumbai. We build upon our earlier analysis, where projections were made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance, infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain the second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak and valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible scenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for Mumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February and mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate after around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this observed sharp convexity. This is not an easy phenomena to replicate, and we find that explanations such as increased laxity in the population, increased reinfections, increased intensity of infections in Mumbai transportation, increased lethality in the virus, or a combination amongst them, generally do a poor job of matching this pattern. We find that the most likely explanation is presence of small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that grows rapidly thereafter and becomes a dominant strain by Mid-March.

Due to fear of infection, government and local authorities in China immediately closed academic institutions and tried to find survival techniques to cope with market turbulence. COVID-19 was present in China at the end of 2019. However, little attention has been paid by researchers to coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and few measures were taken to assess the coping strategies of university students, specifically following the closure of their institutions. To address this gap, this study attempted to discover the coping strategies of Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: We conducted an online survey using a semi-structured questionnaire with a simple random sampling technique and received 559 responses. The survey questions captured information about students lives during the COVID-19 outbreak, actions to control anxiety, and what students care about during the pandemic. The associations between coping strategies used and levels of anxiety were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures. SPSS Statistics v27 was used for statistical analysis in this study. Results: The university students reported that coping strategies and survival techniques were required due to high levels of anxiety and psychological pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the respondents reported the prompt closure of their academic institutions due to COVID-19. Psychological concerns, such as lack of sleep, emotional support, mental support and social appeal, were also reported.

Among individuals with established CVD, African Americans have a higher risk of major cardiac events, which underscores the importance of CR use among African Americans. However, despite their high likelihood of adverse outcomes, CR is poorly utilized in African Americans with CVD. We review data on CR utilization among African Americans, barriers to participation, and the implications for policy and practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Although established as a highly effective secondary prevention strategy, CR is underutilized in general, but especially by African Americans. Notwithstanding efforts to increase CR participation among all groups, participation rates remain low for African Americans and other minorities compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. The low CR participation rates by African Americans can be attributed to an array of factors including differential referral patterns, access to care, and socioeconomic factors. There are several promising strategies to improve CR participation which include promoting evidence-based guidelines, reducing barriers to access, novel CR delivery modalities, including more African Americans in CR clinical research, and increasing diversity in the CR workforce. SUMMARY: African Americans with CVD events are less likely to be referred to, enroll in, and complete CR than Non-Hispanic Whites. There are many factors that impact CR participation by African Americans.

Pregnancy and childbirth could be a time of vulnerability to violence because of changes in physical, emotional, social, and economic demands and needs. Prevalence of IPV against women during the perinatal period is increasingly researched and documented. However, evidence on IPV prevalence among intimate partners as well as on the course of IPV over the perinatal period is scarce. The purpose of this review was to provide a narrative synthesis of the existing literature regarding the prevalence estimates of IPV among intimate partners over the perinatal period. Through this review, we also gained better insight into associated factors, as well as the various forms of IPV. Of the 766 studies assessing prevalence estimates identified, 86 were included, where 80 studies focused on unidirectional IPV (i.e., perpetrated by men against women) and six studies investigated bidirectional IPV (i.e., IPV perpetrated by both partners). Most of the included studies reported lower overall prevalence rates for unidirectional IPV postpartum (range: 2C58%) compared to pregnancy (range: 1.5C66.9%). Psychological violence was found to be the most prevalent form of violence during the entire perinatal period. Studies on bidirectional IPV mostly reported women's perpetration to be almost as high as that of their partner or even higher, yet their findings need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, our results also highlighted the associated factors of IPV among partners, in which they were assimilated into a multi-level ecological model and were analyzed through an intersectional framework. Based on our findings, IPV is found to be highly prevalent during the entire perinatal period and in populations suffering from social inequalities.

This suggests, while older adults who have access to economic, social, and health-related resources can maintain/enhance their LS under the global crisis, those without such assets face the risk of being penalized. In these uncertain times, it is therefore imperative to shed light on the resilience divide among older adults alongside their average strength.","output":"The Resilience Divide Among Older Adults Under Uncertainty: A Positive Sociological Study of Life Satisfaction During the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 has a less severe course in children. In April 2020, some children presented with signs of multisystem inflammation with clinical signs overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD), most of them requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This study aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of KD SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and negative patients during the pandemic in Spain. Material and Methods: Medical data of KD patients from January 1, 2018 until May 30, 2020 was collected from the KAWA-RACE study group. We compared the KD cases diagnosed during the COVID-19 period (March 1CMay 30, 2020) that were either SARS-CoV-2 confirmed (CoV+) or negative (CoVC) to those from the same period during 2018 and 2019 (PreCoV). Results: One hundred and twenty-four cases were collected. There was a significant increase in cases and PICU admissions in 2020 (P-trend = 0.001 and 0.0004, respectively). CoV+ patients were significantly older (7.5 vs. 2.5 yr) and mainly non-Caucasian (64 vs. 29%), had incomplete KD presentation (73 vs. 32%), lower leucocyte (9.5 vs. 15.5  10(9)) and platelet count (174 vs. 423  10(9)/L), higher inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein 18.5vs. 10.9 mg/dl) and terminal segment of the natriuretic atrial peptide (4,766 vs. 505 pg/ml), less aneurysm development (3.8 vs. 11.1%), and more myocardial dysfunction (30.8 vs. 1.6%) than PreCoV patients. Respiratory symptoms were not increased during the COVID-19 period. Conclusion: The KD CoV+ patients mostly meet pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19/multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children criteria.

BACKGROUND: Both ANL and healthy work environment (HWE) contribute to staff and patient outcomes. Our 1st study of these 2 variables revealed a positive relationship. Will this be upheld in a pandemic year? METHODS: More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study using the Authentic Nurse Leadership Questionnaire, the Critical Elements of a Healthy Work Environment Scale, and a pandemic impact on practice question. RESULTS: Overall, nurses perceived ANL and HWE were present despite a high level of pandemic impact; however, when clinical nurses were separated from managers/directors, HWE was not present for frontline nurses. The moderate correlation of ANL and HWE was replicated in this larger study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 2nd study of the positive relationship between ANL and HWE using these models, supporting ANL as an essential standard of a HWE. ANL was present for clinical nurses in a pandemic year signaling that nurse leaders rose to meet frontline leadership needs. HWE was present overall, but not for clinical nurses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this observational retrospective study, the application of the VITOM? exoscope was studied in a group of 21 patients undergoing mono- or bilateral DCR. The primary endpoint was to evaluate resolution of symptoms (epiphora/dacryocystitis) at the 6-month follow-up and time for surgery. Qualitative features of the exoscope (intraoperative view of the surgical field) and comparison with the typical setting for DCR were analyzed as secondary endpoints. A questionnaire was administered to surgical team members (ENT surgeon, ophthalmologist, and scrub nurse) to evaluate the perceived quality of this new technology (12 items valued as \\"good\\" = 2, \\"acceptable\\" = 1, and \\"not acceptable\\" = 0). A questionnaire score of 24 out of 24 was valued as \\"completely approved,\\" score 20-23 as \\"moderately approved,\\" and score 19 as \\"weakly approved.\\" Patients were divided into 3 consecutive groups, and questionnaire scores by each team member were analyzed for tendencies. Statistical analysis was performed to test significance at p < 0.05. Local Ethical Committee approval was obtained. RESULTS No significant differences were found between exoscope-set DCR and classic setting for concerned patient outcomes (failure rate: 3.2 vs. 3.8%, respectively, p = 0.896) and mean time for surgery (20' vs. 23', respectively, p = 0.091).

We describe how the pandemic affected Emergency Department (ED) accesses in a tertiary children's hospital, composed by two different pediatric centers, one located in Rome's city center and the second, Palidoro (regional COVID-19 center), in its surrounding metropolitan area, both in the Lazio region, analyzing the profile of admitted patients during the pandemic period in terms of their general characteristics (at presentation in the ED's) and urgent hospitalizations compared to prepandemic period. METHODS: The study compare the period between the 21st of February and the 30th of April 2020, covering the three phases of the national responses (this period will be referred to as the pandemic period) with the same period of 2019 (prepandemic period). The study analyzes the number of ED visits and urgent hospitalizations and their distribution according to selected characteristics. RESULTS: The reduction of ED visits was 56 and 62%, respectively in Rome and Palidoro centers. The higher relative decline was encountered for Diseases of Respiratory System, and for Diseases of the Nervous System and Sense Organs. A doubling of the relative frequency of hospitalizations was observed, going from 14.2 to 24.4% in Rome and from 6.4 to 10.3% in Palidoro. In terms of absolute daily numbers the decrease of urgent hospitalizations was less sharp than ED visits. For pathologies such as peritonitis, tumors or other possible life-treathening conditions we did not observe a significative increase due to delayed access. CONCLUSIONS: In the pandemic period there was a general reduction in the number of children referred to ED, such reduction was greater in low-acuity levels. The reduction for respiratory tract infections and other communicable diseases during school closure and the national lockdown must make us reflect on the possible impact that these conditions may have on the health system, in particular the ED, at the reopening of schools. The major problem remains the fear for possible diagnostic delays in life-threatening or crippling diseases; our study doesn't demonstrate an increase in number or significant delay in some serious conditions such as tumors, peritonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ileo-colic intussusception and testis/ovary torsion.

In this study, we examined the relationship between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 28-day mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients not previously diagnosed as having diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving all consecutive COVID-19 patients with a definitive 28-day outcome and FBG measurement at admission from 24 January 2020 to 10 February 2020 in two hospitals based in Wuhan, China. Demographic and clinical data, 28-day outcomes, in-hospital complications and CRB-65 scores of COVID-19 patients in the two hospitals were analysed. CRB-65 is an effective measure for assessing the severity of pneumonia and is based on four indicators, i.e. confusion, respiratory rate (>30/min), systolic blood pressure (90 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (60 mmHg), and age (65 years). RESULTS: Six hundred and five COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 114 who died in hospital. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.00, 1.04]), male sex (HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.17, 2.60]), CRB-65 score 1C2 (HR 2.68 [95% CI 1.56, 4.59]), CRB-65 score 3C4 (HR 5.25 [95% CI 2.05, 13.43]) and FBG 7.0 mmol/l (HR 2.30 [95% CI 1.49, 3.55]) were independent predictors for 28-day mortality.

The aim of this study was to assess DyeVert System clinical effectiveness and safety by implementing a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing evidence. METHODS: Systematic electronic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform database. Relevant data were extracted from included studies and meta-analyses were performed to synthesize evidence across studies. RESULTS: The review included 17 eligible studies involving 1,731 DyeVert System cases and 1,387 control cases (without the use of DyeVert). Meta-analyses demonstrated use of the DyeVert System reduced CMV delivered to the patient by 39.27% (95% CI, 36.10C42.48%, P < 0.001), reduced CMV/baseline renal function ratios (Hedgess g, ?0.56; 95% CI, ?0.70 to ?0.42, P < 0.001) and percentage of cases exceeding the maximum CMV threshold (risk difference ?0.31, 95% CI, ?0.48 to ?0.13, P < 0.001) while maintaining adequate image quality in 98% of cases. DyeVert System cases demonstrated lower CA-AKI incidence vs. controls (absolute risk reduction 5.00% (95% CI, 0.40C9.80%; P = 0.03), relative risk 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40C0.90; P = 0.01) with a pooled estimate of the number needed to treat with the DyeVert System to avoid 1 CA-AKI event of 20. CONCLUSION: DyeVert System use significantly reduces CMV delivered to the patient, CMV/baseline renal function ratios, and CA-AKI incidence while maintaining image quality. Accordingly, the device may serve as an adjunctive, procedure-based strategy to prevent CA-AKI. Future multi-center studies are needed to further assess effects of minimizing CMV on endpoints such as CA-AKI prevention, incidence of adverse cardiac and renal events, and health care costs.","output":"DyeVert Contrast Reduction System Use in Patients Undergoing Coronary and/or Peripheral Angiography: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Saliva of patients with COVID-19 has a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The risk of spreading the virus is not insignificant, and procedures for reducing viral loads in the oral cavity have been proposed. Little research to date has been performed on the effect of mouthwashes on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and some of their mechanisms of action remain unknown. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swabs measured by RT-PCR were used for virucidal activity in a 1:1 ratio, with an incubation time of 1 min. The solutions used in this study were: iodopovidone (8 mg); * D-limonene, a terpene extracted from citrus peels (0.3%); (?) cetylpyridinium chloride (0.1%) (CPC); (?) chlorhexidine gluconate (10%) (CHX); () a CPC (0.12%) and CHX (0.05%) containing formula; ** a formula containing essential oils; (??) a CPC containing formula (0.07%); (??) a D-limonene (0.2%) and CPC (0.05%) containing formula; () a solution containing sodium fluoride (0.05%) and CPC (0.075%); *** a solution containing CHX (0.12%) and; () a CHX (0.2%) containing formula. () As a control reaction, saline solution or excipient solution (water, glycerin, citric acid, colorant, sodium citrate) was used. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, we can conclude that a mouthwash containing both D-limonene and CPC reduced the virucidal activity in about 6 logs (>99.999% reduction). Hence, establishing a clinical protocol for dentists is suggested, where all patients to be treated rinse pre-operatively with a mouthwash containing both D-limonene and CPC to reduce the likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 for dentists. This is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals within the community.

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iron (Fe) is one of the most important micronutrients for most life forms on earth. While abundant in soil, Fe bioavailability in oxic soil is very low. In environmental conditions, bacteria need to acquire sufficient Fe to sustain growth while limiting the energy cost of siderophore synthesis. Biofilm formation might mitigate this Fe stress, since it was shown to accumulate Fe in certain Gram-negative bacteria and that this Fe could be mobilized for uptake. However, it is still unclear if and to what extent the amount of Fe accumulated in the biofilm can sustain growth, and if the mobilization of this local Fe pool is modulated by the availability of environmental Fe (i.e., Fe outside the biofilm matrix). Here we use a non-domesticated strain of the ubiquitous biofilm-forming soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, and stable Fe isotopes to precisely evaluate the origin of Fe during growth in the presence of tannic acid and hydroxides, used as proxies for different environmental conditions. We report that this B. subtilis strain can accumulate a large quantity of Fe in the biofilm, largely exceeding Fe associated with cells. We also report that only a fraction of biofilm-bound Fe is available for uptake in the absence of other sources of Fe in the vicinity of the biofilm. We observed that availability of environmental Fe modulates the usage of this pool of biofilm-bound Fe. Finally, our data suggest that consumption of biofilm-bound Fe relates to the efficacy of B. subtilis to transport Fe from the environment to the biofilm, possibly through siderophores.Importance Recent evidences suggest that Fe bound to the biofilm could assume at least two important functions; a local source of Fe for uptake and a support to extracellular metabolism such as extracellular electron transfer. Our results show that B. subtilis can use biofilm-bound Fe for uptake only if it does not compromise Fe homeostasis of the biofilm, i.e., maintaining a minimum Fe concentration in the biofilm for extracellular purposes. We propose a theoretical framework based on our results and recent literature to explain how B. subtilis manages biofilm-bound Fe and Fe uptake in response to environmental Fe availability. These results provide important insights into the management of biofilm-bound and environmental Fe by B. subtilis in response to Fe stress.","output":"Bacillus subtilis modulates its usage of biofilm-bound iron in response to environmental iron availability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been observed majorly following mRNA vaccines.

In Thailand, though PA screening is provided under the universal health coverage, the service can be offered only at some centers. Hence, the service availability affects an accessibility of health care in patients. Our study aimed to evaluate the service utilization in PA screening and diagnosis in terms of geographical inequality in health resources in Southern Thailand. METHODS: Data of 688 patients who underwent PA screening from 2011 to 2017 were obtained from the electronic database of Songklanagarind Hospital, a super-tertiary center in this region. The patients residence in the province, district and subdistrict were transformed to a 6-digit numbers corresponding to the global one (GADM?). The areas with PA screening and diagnosis were visualized by disease mapping procedures. A general log linear model was used to identify the factors affecting patients service accessibility. RESULTS: From the geographic distribution, patients living in or near the area of the super-tertiary center (Songkhla) had high probability of receiving PA screening. The analysis of factors contributing to PA screening by multivariate log-linear model demonstrated that the distance from the super-tertiary center was a predictive factor for screening while the presence of endocrinologists and cultural differences were not. The chance of patients living in Songkhla, living less than 200 km, and more than 200 km from Songkhla to receive PA screening was 100, 82, and 66%, respectively. The crude incidence rate of PA in Southern Thailand was 1.66/10(6) person-years. The provinces located adjacent to the Andaman Sea had the highest incidences of PA (3.62-5.17 patients/10(6) person-years).

Notably, mitotic centrosome area scales closely with changing cell size compared to changes in spindle length for both organisms. One interesting difference between the two is that mitotic centrosomes are asymmetric in size across embryonic zebrafish spindles, with the larger mitotic centrosome being 2.140.13-fold larger in size than the smaller. The largest mitotic centrosome is placed towards the embryo center in a Polo-Like Kinase (PLK) 1 and PLK4 dependent manner 87.144.16% of the time. We propose a model in which uniquely large centrosomes direct spindle placement within the disproportionately large zebrafish embryo cells to orchestrate cell divisions during early embryogenesis.","output":"PLK1- and PLK4-mediated asymmetric mitotic centrosome size and positioning in the early zebrafish embryo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major public health concern. A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","output":"Dynamics of the ACE2 - SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interface reveal unique mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These are unprecedented times, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts public health, social interaction, and employment attachments. Evidence to date has been about broad shifts in unemployment rates as a percent of the labor force. We draw on monthly Current Population Survey data to examine subpopulation changes in employment states across the life course, from January through April 2020. COVID-19 downturns produced disparate life-course impacts. There are increases in unemployment and being out of the workforce at all ages, but especially among young adults, with young women most at risk. Intersectional analyses document conjoint life-course vulnerabilities by gender, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity. For example, Black men aged 20C29 with a college degree experienced a 12.4 percentage point increase in being not in the labor force for other reasons (NILF-other). Individuals with less than a college degree in their 50s and 60s were more likely to become unemployed, regardless of race. And more non-college-educated Asian men in their 60s and 70s reported being retired (6.6 and 8.9 percentage point increases, respectively).

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a \\"two-hit\\" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Owing to its highly contagious nature, rapid detection of CPV is crucial in effective control of the disease. Aptamers have emerged as potential alternative to antibodies as affinity reagents in diagnostic field. Present study was aimed to select and validate ssDNA aptamers specific to CPV. Systematic evolution of ligands through exponential enrichment (SELEX) method was employed for selection of CPV structural protein (VP2) specific DNA aptamers. SELEX was performed using a pool of ssDNA library comprising 30 random nucleotide region. A total of seven rounds of SELEX were performed using VP2 protein as target antigen which yielded ten aptamers (1A-10A) with distinct sequences. Target binding of all ten aptamers was assessed by dot blot and enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) which revealed that 5A, 6A, 9A, and 10A were superior binders. In silico analysis of the aptamers revealed the existence of binding site on VP2 protein, and binding pattern was similar to in vitro findings. The affinity (K(D)) of all these four binders against CPV was evaluated by ELONA indicating relatively higher affinity of 6A and 10A than remaining two DNA sequences. Out of which, aptamer 6A displayed cross-reactivity with canine distemper virus and canine corona virus. Hence, aptamer 10A was considered as better binding sequence having high specificity and affinity for CPV. The study confirms the future utility of selected aptamers in development of a reliable diagnostic for rapid detection of CPV. KEY POINTS: ? Canine parvovirus-specific ssDNA aptamers were identified with nanomolar affinity (100C150 nM). ? Three aptamers displayed negligible cross-reactivity with other related viruses. ?

At the start of the lockdown, which imposed the temporary closure of any gym activities, GGT participants were invited to continue to exercise at home. IHT participants continued to exercise at home as usual. Adherence was recorded via logs and measured as the percentage of exercise sessions actually performed out of the total number of scheduled sessions in three 1-month periods: one before (PRE) and two after (M1 and M2) the beginning of lockdown. Before lockdown, IHT (66.8%  26.6) and GGT (76.3%  26.6) adherence were similar. During lockdown, IHT participation increased (M1: 81.5%  31.0; M2: 88.0%  28.3), while that of GGT showed no statistical differences (M1: 79.4%  34.2; M2: 80.6%  36.4).

We describe disease progression trajectories from diagnosis to potential hospital admission, discharge, readmission, or death. Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. RESULTS: Younger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates.

D614G, along with several variants containing both D614G and another amino acid change, were significantly more infectious. Most variants with amino acid change at receptor binding domain were less infectious but variants including A475V, L452R, V483A and F490L became resistant to some neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the majority of glycosylation deletions were less infectious whilst deletion of both N331 and N343 glycosylation drastically reduced infectivity, revealing the importance of glycosylation for viral infectivity. Interestingly, N234Q was markedly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas N165Q became more sensitive.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study used descriptive qualitative and document analysis approaches via focus group discussion (FGD) among various stakeholders in Indonesia. The FGD was conducted once attended by representatives from various sectors, including health, education, manpower, professional associations, and private. Policies on training, inflow and outflow, maldistribution and efficiencies, and private sector regulation were analyzed. Document analysis was used to triangulate the qualitative data. RESULTS: There is a structured policy regarding production, inflow and outflow, distribution, and involvement of the private sector. The number of nursing production shows an excess when entering the labor markets; however, the health-care providers reported a nursing workforce shortage. Policies on outflow encourage the deployment of Indonesian nurses overseas despite various challenges.

However, since the drug is not readily available, it is important to rapidly and appropriately identify high-risk patients who can benefit most from therapy. Therefore, we designed a risk scoring system to identify at-risk COVID-19 patients in our region during the largest surge of COVID-19, from July to September 2021. METHODS: According to the risk scores, confirmed COVID-19 patients were introduced to receive REGN-CoV-2 to our hospital by regional health centre from 18th August (Term 3). The primary outcome was the comparison of the number of hospitalisation and severe condition with other periods, the 4th wave (Term 1) and the early part of the 5th wave (Term 2) in Japan. RESULTS: During Term 3, 115 patients were stratified with the scoring system and administered REGN-COV-2. The number of hospitalisation vs severe cases were 60 (5.2%) vs 14 (1.2%), 8 (1.5%) vs 3 (0.6%) and 21 (1.2%) vs 2 (0.1%), in term 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Among those aged <60 years, compared with term 1, the relative risk of hospitalisation and severe condition were 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12C0.53) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01C0.80), respectively, in term 3.

While the advertising-based model for local news has been under threat for many years, the COVID-19 pandemic and recession have created what some describe as an extinction level threat for local newspapers and other struggling news outlets. More than one-fourth of the countrys newspapers have disappeared, leaving residents in thousands of communities living in vast news deserts.As local news sources decline, a growing proportion of Americans are getting their news and other information from social media. This raises serious concerns, including the spread of misinformation and the use of platform infrastructure to engage in disinformation campaigns. Platforms wield significant advantages over local news sources in the current information environment: the dominant platforms possess proprietary, detailed caches of user data, which the platforms use to force advertisers, users, and news outlets into asymmetrical relationships. In the vacuum left by the disappearance of local news sources, users are increasingly reliant on information sources that are incomplete, and may be misleading or deceptive.This whitepaper examines current research related to the decline of local news, the rise of platforms, and the spread of mis- and disinformation and explores potential regulatory and policy responses to these issues. Some proposals focus on increasing the supply of C and demand for C local news, including increased public education and expanded support for journalists and local news organizations.

However, the previous literature has not yet captured the explicit processes by which these contributions are made.Design/methodology/approachData from 711 respondents selected from an alumni collaboration network were subjected to structural equation modeling analysis.FindingsThe study explored resource conservation (belongingness) as the primary relational mechanism for alumni to share their instrumental resources (knowledge sharing), supporting resources (citizenship behavior) and competent resources (coproduction behavior). Knowledge sharing and citizenship behavior act as intermediate agents to trigger coproduction behavior. The authors show how subjective norm, group norm and trust is regarded as a tool to reduce bonding intrusiveness (i.e. the intrusive side-effects of a bond) and moderate the indirect effect of belongingness on coproduction and the direct effect of citizenship on coproduction.Research limitations/implicationsBy applying attachment theory, conservation of resources theory and digital platform networking perspectives, this study describes major implications for designing inspiring and compatible community platforms.Practical implicationsGuidance is provided for improving sustainable alumni communities through citizenship-sharing and coproduction behavior.Social implicationsOnline alumni communities are regarded as resource conservators, which can result in valuable coproduction, via the sharing of knowledge, expertise and skillsets to create profit for a range of institutions and industries.Originality/valueAlumni networking platforms encourage alumni cohesiveness, stimulate knowledge exchange and improve professionalism.","output":"Capture coproduction behavior in networking alumni communities: Progress from platform belongingness, knowledge sharing, and citizenship behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The level of taxpayer compliance has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regional Revenue Management Agency recorded that as many as 1.6 million motorized vehicles were in arrears in taxes as of September 2020. This study aims to empirically examine the effect of the tax whitening program, taxpayer awareness, and tax knowledge on taxpayer compliance with tax socialization as a moderating variable in the correlation. The questionnaire uses a Likert scale with 100 motor vehicle taxpayers domiciled in the Cilacap, Banyumas, Purbalingga, Banjarnegara, and Kebumen areas. The research sample was taken using the non-probability sampling technique. The questionnaire data was then processed using Partial Least Square (PLS> analysis by testing the outer and inner models. The results show that tax whitening, taxpayer awareness, and tax knowledge directly impact taxpayer compliance. However, tax socialization does not affect taxpayer compliance. Tax socialization cannot moderate the factors that support taxpayer compliance and does not directly affect taxpayer compliance. This study explains that tax whitening can be used as a solution to improve vehicle tax compliance. Meanwhile, tax awareness and tax knowledge which are internal factors, reflect that taxpayers have good knowledge to be aware of their obligations to pay taxes and comply with existing tax regulations. Tax socialization cannot moderate the factors that support taxpayer compliance and does not directly affect taxpayer compliance. These conditions indicate the government's lack of effort in providing tax information and knowledge to the public.

The identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to reveal previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1, for some of the eight chemotherapeutics. Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.","output":"The Gene scb-1 Underlies Variation in Caenorhabditis elegans Chemotherapeutic Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, an emerging coronavirus, has spread rapidly around the world, resulting in over ten million cases and more than half a million deaths as of July 1, 2020. Effective treatments and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection do not currently exist. Previous studies demonstrated that nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) of coronavirus is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent 2-O-methyltransferase (2-O-MTase) that has an important role in viral replication and prevents recognition by the host innate immune system. In the present study, we employed structural analysis, virtual screening, and molecular simulation approaches to identify clinically investigated and approved drugs which can act as promising inhibitors against nsp16 2-O-MTase of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative analysis of primary amino acid sequences and crystal structures of seven human CoVs defined the key residues for nsp16 2-O-MTase functions. Virtual screening and docking analysis ranked the potential inhibitors of nsp16 from more than 4,500 clinically investigated and approved drugs. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on eight top candidates, including Hesperidin, Rimegepant, Gs-9667, and Sonedenoson, to calculate various structural parameters and understand the dynamic behavior of the drug-protein complexes.

We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through respiratory transmission using a quantitative microbial risk assessment framework by retrieving SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from the swab tests of 251 Thai patients. Three virus-generating scenarios were investigated: an infector breathing, breathing with a cough, and breathing with a sneeze. Infection risk (97.5th percentile) was as high as 10-3 with breathing and increased to 10-1 with a cough or sneeze, thus all higher than the risk benchmark of 5 x 10-5 per event. No significant gender differences for toilet users (receptors) were noted. The highest risk scenario of breathing and a sneeze was further evaluated for risk mitigation measures. Risk mitigation to lower than the benchmark succeeded only when the infector and receptor simultaneously wore an N95 respirator or surgical mask and when the receptor wore an N95 respirator and the infector wore a denim fabric mask. Ventilation up to 20 air changes per hour (ACH), beyond the 12-ACH suggested by the WHO, did not mitigate risk. Virus concentration, volume of expelled droplets, and receptor dwell time were identified as the main contributors to transmission risk. Highlights- The use of public toilets poses a risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission - Highest risks generated in the order of sneezing, coughing, and breathing - No gender differences in risk by counteracting dwell times and inhalation rates - Ventilation did not reduce risk even at 20 ACH, beyond the WHO-recommended value - N95 and surgical masks offer the most effective risk mitigation to toilet users Graphical abstract O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\\"FIGDIR/small/457245v1_ufig1.gif\\" ALT=\\"Figure 1\\"> View larger version (36K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e25795org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e429eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c002aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef001e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG","output":"Effects of face masks and ventilation on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission in public toilets: a quantitative microbial risk assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The built environment can contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by facilitating human mobility and social contacts between infected and uninfected individuals.

In this study, we aimed to objectively assess the influence of key built environment factors, which create spaces for activitiesinferred activity rather than actually observed activityon the spread of COVID-19 across townships in China at its initial stage through a random forest approach. Taking data for 2994 township-level administrative units, the spread is measured by two indicators: the ratio of cumulative infection cases (RCIC), and the coefficient of variation of infection cases (CVIC) that reflects the policy effect in the initial stage of the spread. Accordingly, we selected 19 explanatory variables covering built environment factors (urban facilities, land use, and transportation infrastructure), the level of nighttime activities, and the inter-city population flow (from Hubei Province). We investigated the spatial agglomerations based on an analysis of bivariate local indicators of spatial association between RCIC and CVIC. We found spatial agglomeration (or positive spatial autocorrelations) of RCIC and CVIC in about 20% of all townships under study. The density of convenience shops, supermarkets and shopping malls (DoCSS), and the inter-city population flow (from Hubei Province) are the two most important variables to explain RCIC, while the population flow is the most important factor in measuring policy effects (CVIC). When the DoCSS gets to 21/km(2), the density of comprehensive hospitals to 0.7/km(2), the density of road intersections to 72/km(2), and the density of gyms and sports centers to 2/km(2), their impacts on RCIC reach their maximum and remain constant with further increases in the density values.

Background: The pandemic has forced nurse leaders to face new challenges. Knowledge about their experiences may contribute to advancing leadership practices in times of future crises. Methods: A qualitative directed content analysis was chosen. The theoretical perspective was person-centred leadership. Thirteen ward managers from a Danish university hospital were included and interviewed using telephone interviews three months after the first national COVID-19 case was confirmed. Findings: The main findings of the study revealed that the ward managers often experienced a lack of timely, relevant information, involvement in decision-making and acknowledgement from the head nurse of department and the executive management. This was caused by the existing organizational cultures and the traditional hierarchy of communication. This meant that the ward managers' sense of own competences and leadership values and beliefs came under high pressure when they had to balance different stakeholders' needs. Conclusion: When the experience of ward managers results in them being unable to lead authentically and competently in a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of engagement can occur, with serious consequences for patients, staff and the ward managers themselves. Traditional organizational cultures that are hierarchical and controlling needs to be challenged and reoriented towards collaborative, inclusive and participative practices of engagement and involvement.

The proposed optimization algorithm is able to determine the time and duration of social distancing policies in the country. The achieved results are based on data from the period between March and May of 2020, regarding the cumulative number of infections and deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This dataset is assumably largely sub-notified due to the absence of mass testing in Brazil. Thus, the MPC is based on a SIR model which is identified using an uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion. Furthermore, this model includes an additional dynamic variable that mimics the response of the population to the social distancing policies determined by the government, which affect the COVID-19 transmission rate. The proposed control method is set within a mixed-logical formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (existence or the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to avoid too frequent shifts between these two inputs. The achieved simulation results illustrate how such optimal control method would operate in practice, pointing out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August 2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days. This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021.

The timed inspiratory effort (TIE) index is a recently proposed weaning index that has been reported to be effective in predicting successful weaning. We sought to analyze the respiratory muscle groups involved with the TIE index measurement utilizing the surface electromyography (sEMG). METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study including 46 mechanically ventilated subjects. The variable analyzed with sEMG was the root mean square (RMS) for correlation with the degree of recruitment of motor units and strength. The data were obtained along the 60 s of the TIE index measurement and analyzed in each one of the 3 20-s intervals. Pooled and individual muscle RMS values were analyzed comparing success and failure groups. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) age of the participants was 80 (71-87) y. The pooled sEMG data showed that muscle strength increased over time, following the profile observed for maximum inspiratory pressure, irrespective of the analyzed group. However, in line with the findings regarding maximum inspiratory pressure, the RMS medians were statistically higher at every 20-s interval in the success group. Diaphragm strength increased over time, with values reaching statistically significant differences at the end of the observation period, but only in the success group. In addition, diaphragm strength was statistically higher during the whole test in the success group. Finally, there was a substantial increase in sternocleidomastoid strength over time after 40 s of observation, which was not observed in the scalene muscles. CONCLUSIONS Subjects succeeding in a weaning trial had higher muscle strength, confirmed in the pooled and the individual sEMG analysis.

Process quality control of its ethanol precipitation is a topical issue in the pharmaceutical field. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is commonly used for process quality analysis. However, establishing a robust and reliable quantitative model of complex process remains a challenge in industrial applications of NIR. In this paper, modeling design based on quality by design concept (QbD) was implemented for the ethanol precipitation process quality control of Honeysuckle flower. According to the 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots, quadratic model was the best with Radj2 increasing from 0.1395 to 0.9085, indicating the strong interaction among spectral pre-processing methods, variable selection methods, and latent factors. SG9 and CARS was an appropriate combination for modeling. Furthermore, spectral assignment method was creatively introduced for variable selection. Another 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots were established. Compared with the chemometric variable selection method, spectral assignment combined with QbD concept made a higher Rpre2 and a lower RMSEP. When the latent factors of PLS was small, Rpre2 of the model by spectral assignment increased from 0.9605 to 0.9916 and RMSEP decreased from 0.1555 mg/mL to 0.07134 mg/mL. This result suggests that the variable selected by spectral assignment is more representative and precise.

DESIGN: Epidemiological study. SETTING: Six open LTCFs in Albacete (Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 198 residents and 190 workers from LTCF A were included, between 2020 March 6 and April 5. Epidemiological data were also collected from six LTCFs of Albacete for the same period of time, including 1,084 residents. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline demographic, clinical, functional, cognitive and nutritional variables were collected. 1-month and 3-month mortality was determined, excess mortality was calculated, and costs associated with the pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: The pooled mortality rate for the first month and first three months of the outbreak were 15.3% and 28.0%, and the pooled excess mortality for these periods were 564% and 315% respectively. In facility A, the percentage of probable COVID-19 infected residents were 33.6%. Probable infected patients were older, frail, and with a worse functional situation than those without COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever, cough and dyspnea. 25 residents were transferred to the emergency department, 21 were hospitalized, and 54 were moved to the facility medical unit. Mortality was higher upon male older residents, with worse functionality, and higher comorbidity. During the first month of the outbreak, 65 (24.6%) workers leaved, mainly with COVID-19 symptoms, and 69 new workers were contracted. The mean number of days of leave was 19.2. Costs associated with the COVID-19 in facility A were estimated at  276,281/month, mostly caused by resident hospitalizations, leaves of workers, staff replacement, and interventions of healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic posed residents at high mortality risk, mainly in those older, frail and with worse functional status.

Isolation is an important aspect of infection prevention and control, but has been associated with undesirable consequences among hospital inpatients. The aim of the present study was to determine if isolation is associated with an increased length of stay (LOS) in the ED. METHODS: The Registry for Emergency Care Project is a prospective cohort study with a series of nested sub-studies. The present study was a retrospective analysis of adult patients allocated an Australasian Triage Scale category of 1 or 2 who presented to a tertiary ED between 18 and 31 May 2020. The primary outcome was ED LOS. Regression methods were used to determine the independent association between ED isolation and LOS. RESULTS: There were 447 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 123 (28%) were managed in isolation. The median (interquartile range) ED LOS was 259 (210-377) min for the isolation group and 204 (126-297) min for the non-isolation group, a difference in median ED LOS of 55 min (P < 0.001). Isolation was independently associated with a 23% increase in ED LOS (P = 0.002) and doubled the odds of an ED stay of more than 4 h (adjusted odds ratio 2.2 [1.4-3.4], P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Consistent with the anecdotal experience of Australian ED clinicians, the present study demonstrated an increased ED LOS for patients managed in isolation.

Telehealth has the potential to provide timely, patient-centred care where transfer to hospital can be a burden and avoided. The extent to which video telehealth is superior to other forms of telecommunication and its impact on management of acutely unwell residents in aged care facilities has not been explored previously. METHODS: In this study, video-telehealth consultation was added to an existing program, the Aged Care Emergency (ACE) program, aiming at further reducing Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions. This controlled pre-post study introduced video-telehealth consultation as an additional component to the ACE program for acutely unwell residents in RACs. Usual practice is for RACs and ACE to liaise via telephone. During the study, when the intervention RACs called the ED advanced practice nurse, video-telehealth supported clinical assessment and management. Five intervention RACs were compared with eight control RACs, all of whom refer to one community hospital in regional New South Wales, Australia. Fourteen months pre-video-telehealth was compared with 14 months post-video-telehealth using generalized linear mixed models for hospital admissions after an ED visit and ED visits. One thousand two hundred seventy-one ED visits occurred over the 28-month study period with 739 subsequent hospital admissions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hospital admission or ED visits after the introduction of video-telehealth; adjusted incident rate ratios (IRR) were 0.98 (confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.77) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.47) respectively.

It manifests as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma or atopic dermatitis if mast cells are activated in the respective organs. In case of systemic mast cell activation, life-threatening anaphylaxis may occur. Currently, type I hypersensitivities are treated either with glucocorticoids, anti-histamines, or mast cell stabilizers. Although these drugs exert a strong anti-allergic effect, their long-term use may be problematic due to their side-effects. RESULTS In the course of a routine in vitro screening process, we identified beta-escin as a potentially anti-allergic compound. Here we tested beta-escin in two mouse models to confirm this anti-allergic effect in vivo. In a model of the early phase of allergic reactions, the murine passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model, beta-escin inhibited the effects of mast cell activation and degranulation in the skin and dose-dependently prevented the extravasation of fluids into the tissue. Beta-escin also significantly inhibited the late response after antigen challenge in a lung allergy model with ovalbumin-sensitized mice. Allergic airway inflammation was suppressed, which was exemplified by the reduction of leucocytes, eosinophils, IL-5 and IL-13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histopathological examinations further confirmed the reduced inflammation of the lung tissue. In both models, the inhibitory effect of beta-escin was comparable to the benchmark dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated in two independent murine models of type I hypersensitivity that beta-escin has potent anti-allergic properties. These results and the excellent safety profile of beta-escin suggest a therapeutic potential of this compound for a novel treatment of allergic diseases.","output":"Beta-escin has potent anti-allergic efficacy and reduces allergic airway inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The timely release of SARS-CoV-2 first genomic sequences allowed the identification of the etiologic agent and development of diagnostic protocols.

Initial epidiemiology showed that the majority of cases were in returned travellers from overseas. One aspect of Public Health response was to introduce compulsory 14 day quarantine for all travellers returning to New South Wales (NSW) by air or sea in Special Health Accommodation (SHA). We aim to outline the establishment of a specialised health quarantine accommodation service in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe the first month of COVID-19 screening. METHODS: The SHA was established with a comprehensive governance structure, remote clinical management through Royal Prince Alfred Virtual Hospital (rpavirtual) and site management with health care workers, NSW Police and accommodation staff. RESULTS: From 29 March to 29 April 2020, 373 returning travellers were admitted to the SHA from Sydney Airport. 88 (26.1%) of those swabbed were positive for SARS-CoV 2. The day of diagnosis of COVID-19 varied from Day 1 to Day 13, with 63.6% (n = 56) of these in the first week of quarantine. 50% of the people in the SHA were referred to rpavirtual for ongoing clinical management. Seven people required admission to hospital for ongoing clinical care. CONCLUSION: The Public Health response to COVID-19 in Australia included early and increased case detection through testing, tracing of contacts of confirmed cases, social distancing and prohibition of gatherings. In addition to these measures, the introduction of mandated quarantine for travellers to Australia was integral to the successful containment of COVID-19 in NSW and Australia through the prevention of transmission locally and interstate from returning travellers.","output":"Control of COVID-19 in Australia through quarantine: the role of special health accommodation (SHA) in New South Wales, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RationaleCOVID-19 lockdown restrictions profoundly disrupted lives and often adversely affected health and wellbeing.

This study explores how people managed their LTCs, health and wellbeing under social distancing restrictions and self-isolation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examines why some people managed better than others.MethodsTelephone interviews were conducted between 11th May and 13th July 2020 with people (n=44) aged 40 to 75 living in an urban and largely deprived area of North East England with one or more of eight LTCs, often including types 2 diabetes. Audio recorded interviews lasted between 20C120 minutes with an average of 50 minutes. Data were descriptively coded with the assistance of Nvivo 12 software and analysed using a social constructivist thematic analysis.ResultsWe found that while some deployed a range of capitals and/or etched out tactics to make life habitable, others experienced zones of impossibility in which current health and wellbeing deteriorated and tangible futures retreated from view. Our analysis highlights inequalities amongst people with LTCs, and in particular regarding access to greenspace, exercise social and digital connection. Those people who were instructed to shield, had complex health issues, difficult life circumstances, or were living in the most disadvantaged situations were less able to deploy various forms of capital to cope with the lockdown, or to etch out tactics to mitigate negative effects. However, regardless of their circumstances, people expressed an attitude of getting on with it and just coping because they perceived others as in the same boat or worse off than themselves.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the impact of inequalities on the management of long term conditions during social isolation, and highlight the importance of outdoor mobility, exercise and social support for managing wellbeing and health.","output":"Managing disruption at a distance: unequal experiences of people living with long-term conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 is ravaging the lives of millions of people across the globe, a second pandemic black fungus has surfaced robbing people of their lives especially people who are recovering from coronavirus.

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs 4 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of 0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (>28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], 1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, 3.70%). IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds.

People exhibited various reactive behaviors to confront with this stressful situation. In Iran, one of the common motives for alcohol consumption is to scape problems and cope with stresses. It has been shown that personality factors influence alcohol consumption, since they are associated with drinking motives. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between temperament and character and alcohol abuse. METHODS: This cross-section study was conducted on 135 alcohol intoxicated patients admitted to emergency room in March 2020 and 255 participants who were randomly selected from public in Shiraz. A questionnaire consisted of TCI (Temperament and character inventory) and several questions about COVID-19 pandemic. It was completed by a trained interviewer using the matched answer technique. Demographic factors were self-reported. RESULTS: Among the alcohol intoxicated group, 117 (86.7%) were males and 18(13.3%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 32.43  10.81 years. Among control group, 99 (38.8%) were males and 156 (61.2%) were females. The mean age of control group was 33.12  14.77 years. Alcohol toxicity was mostly observed among the young males (male/female ratio was 6.45). According to temperament and character index, mean scores of novelty seeking, harm avoidant, and self-transcendence were higher in the alcohol toxicity group than normal population (P < 0.01). Mean scores of reward dependent, cooperativeness, and self-directedness were higher in normal population than the alcohol toxicity group (P < 0.001). The mean score of persistence was not significantly different between methanol intoxicated and normal population groups (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: Alcohol intoxicated patients had higher scores of novelty-seeking and self-transcendence and lower scores of reward-dependency scores, cooperativeness and self-directedness.

Bedside assessment of lung recruitability is crucial for personalized lung-protective mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Methods: We developed a transoesophageal lung ultrasound (TE-LUS) method in which a quantitative (computer-assisted) grayscale determination served as a guide to PEEP-induced lung recruitment. The method is based on the following hypothesis: when the PEEP increases, inflation of the recruited alveoli leads to significant changes in the air/water ratio. Normally ventilated areas are hypoechoic because the ultrasound waves are weakly reflected while poorly aerated areas or non-aerated areas are hyperechoic. We calculated the TE-LUS re-aeration score (RAS) as the ratio of the mean gray scale level at low PEEP to that value at high PEEP for the lower and upper lobes. A RAS > 1 indicated an increase in ventilated area. We used this new method to detect changes in ventilation in patients with a low (<0.5) vs. high (0.5) recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e., the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and the respiratory system compliance at low PEEP). Results: We included 30 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. In patients with a high R/I ratio, the TE-LUS RAS was significantly higher in the lower lobes than in the upper lobes (1.20 [1.12C1.63] vs. 1.05 [0.89C1.38]; p = 0.05). Likewise, the TE-LUS RAS in the lower lobes was significantly higher in the high R/I group than in the low R/I group (1.20 [1.12C1.63] vs. 1.07 [1.00C1.20]; p = 0.04). Conclusion: The increase in PEEP induces a substantial gain in the ventilation detected by TE-LUS of poorly or non-aerated lower lobes (dependent lung regions), especially in patients with a high R/I ratio.","output":"Transoesophageal Ultrasound Assessment of Lung Aeration in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the betacoronavirus family, which causes COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in humans leads to increased mortality rates due to alterations of significant pathways, including some resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses linked to the \\"cytokine storm\\" and extensive lung pathology, as well as being linked to a number of comorbidities. Our current study compared five SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different geographical regions to those from SARS, MERS and two cold viruses, OC43 and 229E, to identify the presence of miR-like sequences. We identified seven key miRs, which highlight considerable differences between the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, compared with the other viruses. The level of conservation between the five SARS-CoV-2 sequences was identical but poor compared with the other sequences, with SARS showing the highest degree of conservation. This decrease in similarity could result in reduced levels of transcriptional control, as well as a change in the physiological effect of the virus and associated host-pathogen responses. MERS and the milder symptom viruses showed greater differences and even significant sequence gaps. This divergence away from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences broadly mirrors the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the whole-genome alignments. Therefore, patterns of mutation, occurring during sequence divergence from the longer established human viruses to the more recent ones, may have led to the emergence of sequence motifs that can be related directly to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we identified 7 key-microRNAs (miRs 8066, 5197, 3611, 3934-3p, 1307-3p, 3691-3p, 1468-5p) with significant links to KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses. According to Bioproject data (PRJNA615032), SARS-CoV-2 mediated transcriptomic alterations were similar to the target pathways of the selected 7 miRs identified in our study. This mechanism could have considerable significance in determining the symptom spectrum of future potential pandemics. KEGG pathway analysis revealed a number of critical pathways linked to the seven identified miRs that may provide insight into the interplay between the virus and comorbidities. Based on our reported findings, miRNAs may constitute potential and effective therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 and its pathological consequences.","output":"The Prediction of miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes: hsa-miR Databases Identify 7 Key miRs Linked to Host Responses and Virus Pathogenicity-Related KEGG Pathways Significant for Comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Measuring patient experiences provides important insight into the quality of Dutch healthcare.

Trend analyses with repeated measurements (2016C2020) were performed and differences between subgroups were tested with Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Quality of care ratings are mainly positive, also during the COVID-19-pandemic in autumn of 2020. In that year, people are the least satisfied with the coordination between healthcare providers and with preventive healthcare of their illness (64% and 67% is satisfied respectively). Trend analyses show that satisfaction with preventive healthcare has declined and satisfaction with shared decision-making has fluctuated over the years. People who experience consequences for their health(care) during the COVID-19-pandemic, are less satisfied with different aspects of healthcare quality than those who experience no consequences.

Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry.

It is unclear how vaccine-induced antibody levels quantitatively compare to the wide spectrum induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine response kinetics and magnitudes in persons with prior COVID-19 compared to virus-na??ve persons are not well-defined. The relative stability of vaccine-induced versus infection-induced antibody levels is unclear. We addressed these issues with longitudinal assessments of vaccinees with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of anti-RBD antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-na??ve individuals achieved levels similar to mild natural infection after the first vaccination; a second dose generated levels approaching severe natural infection. In persons with prior COVID-19, one dose boosted levels to the high end of severe natural infection even in those who never had robust responses from infection, increasing no further after the second dose. Antiviral neutralizing assessments using a spike-pseudovirus assay revealed that virus-na??ve vaccinees did not develop physiologic neutralizing potency until the second dose, while previously infected persons exhibited maximal neutralization after one dose. Finally, antibodies from vaccination waned similarly to natural infection, resulting in an average of 90% loss within 90 days. In summary, our findings suggest that two doses are important for quantity and quality of humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2-na??ve persons, while a single dose has maximal effects in those with past infection.

While in animals, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies thousands of intracellular proteins, the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii transfers a different sugar, fucose, to proteins involved in transcription, mRNA processing, and signaling. Knockout experiments showed that TgSPY, an ortholog of plant SPINDLY and paralog of host OGT, is required for nuclear O-fucosylation. Here we verify that TgSPY is the nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) by 1) complementation with TgSPY-MYC(3), 2) its functional dependence on amino acids critical for OGT activity, and 3) its ability to O-fucosylate itself and a model substrate and to specifically hydrolyze GDP-Fuc. While many of the endogenous proteins modified by O-Fuc are important for tachyzoite fitness, O-fucosylation by TgSPY is not essential. Growth of spy tachyzoites in fibroblasts is modestly affected, despite marked reductions in the levels of ectopically expressed proteins normally modified with O-fucose. Intact TgSPY-MYC(3) localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas catalytic mutants often displayed reduced abundance. spy tachyzoites of a luciferase-expressing type II strain exhibited infection kinetics in mice similar to wild-type but increased persistence in the chronic brain phase, potentially due to an imbalance of regulatory protein levels. The modest changes in parasite fitness in vitro and in mice, despite profound effects on reporter protein accumulation, and the characteristic punctate localization of O-fucosylated proteins suggest that TgSPY controls the levels of proteins to be held in reserve for response to novel stresses.","output":"The nucleocytosolic O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY affects protein expression and virulence in Toxoplasma gondii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by examining several blood parameters mainly white blood cell (WBC) count, granulocytes, platelet, and novel hemocytometric markers neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR).

Thus, he was referred to a tertiary hospital for management. The electrocardiogram revealed complete AV block and elevated cardiac troponin I level. However, echocardiography was normal. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and a temporary pacemaker was inserted. Then, the patient was transferred to the COVID ward and stayed there for nine days. During the admission, cardiac rhythm became sinusal and an improvement was observed in the patients general condition. Thus, he was discharged. In two weekly follow-up visits after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic and the ECG did not change. Follow-up echocardiography was also normal. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement may occur in healthy individuals without cardiac risk factors and respiratory or cardiac presentations due to COVID-19 infection.","output":"Heart Block in Coronavirus-2019: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine administration is under way worldwide to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic.

However, there is a dearth of efficacious interventions for reducing ARA among SGMY. To address this intervention gap, we designed a novel web-based methodology leveraging the field of human-centered design to generate multiple ARA intervention concepts with SGMY. Objective: This paper aims to describe study procedures for a pilot study to rigorously test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of using web-based human-centered design methods with SGMY to create novel, stakeholder-driven ARA intervention concepts. Methods: We are conducting a longitudinal, web-based human-centered design study with 45-60 SGMY (aged between 14 and 18 years) recruited via social media from across the United States. Using MURAL (a collaborative, visual web-based workspace) and Zoom (a videoconferencing platform), the SGMY will participate in four group-based sessions (1.5 hours each). In session 1, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually document their ideas about healthy and unhealthy relationship characteristics and then use affinity clustering as a group to categorize their self-reported ideas based on similarities and differences. In session 2, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually critique a universal evidence-based intervention to reduce ARA and affinity clustering to aggregate their ideas as a group. In session 3, the SGMY will use a creative matrix to generate intervention ideas for reducing ARA among them and force-rank the intervention ideas based on their potential ease of implementation and potential impact using an importance-difficulty matrix. In session 4, the SGMY will generate and refine intervention concepts (from session 3 ideations) to reduce ARA using round robin (for rapid iteration) and concept poster (for fleshing out ideas more fully). We will use content analyses to document the intervention concepts. In a follow-up survey, the SGMY will complete validated measures about the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the web-based human-centered design methods (a priori benchmarks for success: means &gt;3.75 on each 5-point scale). Results: This study was funded in February 2020. Data collection began in August 2020 and will be completed by April 2021. Conclusions: Through rigorous testing of the feasibility of our web-based human-centered design methodology, our study may help demonstrate the use of human-centered design methods to engage harder-to-reach stakeholders and actively involve them in the co-creation of relevant interventions. Successful completion of this project also has the potential to catalyze intervention research to address ARA inequities for SGMY. Finally, our approach may be transferable to other populations and health topics, thereby advancing prevention science and health equity.

The situation seems to be uncontrollable both because of the widespread of the virus and contamination of surroundings due to it, as well as a longer period of lockdown has emerged new social and economic problems. So, it is advised by the experts that this situation has to be dealt with by taking care of many precautions in mind while carrying out our daily life routine. On the other hand, frontline workers, policemen, and doctors need to protect themselves even after being exposed to the affected patients. For their safety and others, personal protective equipment (PPE) is the safeguard in this situation. The prime aim of PPE is to break the chain and avoid human to human contact. To develop these PPEs, scientists and experts have been designing and manufacturing kits consisting of various types of masks, face visors, gloves, glasses, shoe covers, surgical suits, and caps. Keeping the dimensions of the novel coronavirus in mind, i.e., 80C220 nm, the PPE kits are made to allow ventilation to the body along with the sole purpose of protection. For this, various methods of manufacturing these types of equipment are adapted, especially 3D printing is widely used for making face visors. The potential applications of nanomaterials came into the picture due to their properties such as antibacterial, hydrophobicity, transparency, and flexibility.

Health care personnel were facing an unprecedented problem with limited information. On this background, we have reviewed the operational challenges faced and the protocols followed by us while managing emergency surgical patients. The clinical presentations, RT-PCR testing rates, trend of COVID-19 positivity in emergency surgical patients and its comparison to the general population, swab positivity among screen positive and negative patients, grade of COVID-19 affection, the outcomes in emergency surgical patients, and COVID-19 affection in treating personnel is studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A protocol for triaging patients at presentation into screen positive or negative for COVID-19 was instituted. A proforma for all admitted patients over the period of March 2020 to August 2020 was maintained. A retrospective review of this data was carried out after Institutional Ethics Committee permission. RESULTS: A total of 222 patients presented to the surgical emergency, of which 110 required admission. Of the admitted patients, 28 were COVID-19 positive. The positivity amongst admitted and operated patients increased to 50% and 66.67%, respectively in August. The difference in mortality rate amongst the operated COVID-19 positive (11.1%) and negative (14.28%) patients was nonsignificant. None of the treating doctors had to be quarantined during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The number of COVID-19 positive patients rose serially over the study period. The outcome was not affected by the COVID-19 status in mild cases. A high rate of COVID-19 positivity was seen in patients requiring emergency surgery. Universal precautions ensured delivering treatment to emergency patients in standard time. Testing should continue for all as screening alone is not effective as the virus spreads into the population.

Here we examined the distribution and densities of face masks on some of the main tourist beaches in Chile, and we monitored their daily accumulation rates on one beach in northern-central Chile. Face masks were found on beaches across the country with average densities of 0.006  0.002 (mean  se) face masks m-2, which are higher than densities reported on Peruvian beaches, but lower than those on some Kenyan beaches. Face masks were also found on more remote beaches and rocky shores in northern-central Chile. Daily accumulation rates on one tourist beach were low during austral fall/winter (0.2 face masks km-1 d-1), but were over ten times higher during austral summer (3.0 face masks km-1 d-1). These values are substantially higher than daily accumulation rates reported from urban streets, which is most likely due to the high densities of beach visitors during the summer tourist season. COVID-19 related infrastructure (signposts and PPE waste bins) was present on most beaches, but while signposts about personal protection were abundant, there were few signposts about littering, and only one of the 12 beaches sampled for COVID infrastructure had a signpost that offered recommendations about the proper disposal of used face masks. Specific waste bins for PPE waste were only available at three beaches. Based on these findings it is recommended to provide sufficient PPE-related signs and waste bins, establish general and strict waste disposal regulations, and to improve enforcement. Educational campaigns should aim at recommending proper use and disposal of face masks, litter prevention, reduction of single-use waste and enhanced pro-environmental behaviors.","output":"COVID lessons from the global south C face masks invading tourist beaches and recommendations for the outdoor seasons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erythema gyratum repens (EGR) is considered a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by the eruption of expanding, concentric, erythematous patches and plaques (1,2).

The minimum sample size criteria aim to ensure precise estimation of key measures of a model's predictive performance, including measures of calibration, discrimination, and net benefit. Here, we extend the sample size guidance to prediction models with a time-to-event (survival) outcome, to cover external validation in datasets containing censoring. A simulation-based framework is proposed, which calculates the sample size required to target a particular confidence interval width for the calibration slope measuring the agreement between predicted risks (from the model) and observed risks (derived using pseudo-observations to account for censoring) on the log cumulative hazard scale. Precise estimation of calibration curves, discrimination, and net-benefit can also be checked in this framework. The process requires assumptions about the validation population in terms of the (i) distribution of the model's linear predictor and (ii) event and censoring distributions. Existing information can inform this; in particular, the linear predictor distribution can be approximated using the C-index or Royston's D statistic from the model development article, together with the overall event risk. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to calculate the sample size required to validate a prediction model for recurrent venous thromboembolism. Ideally the sample size should ensure precise calibration across the entire range of predicted risks, but must at least ensure adequate precision in regions important for clinical decision-making.

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19.

Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihoodratio (LR) + 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score 3; n=17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score 2; n=137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19.

Comprehensive in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro experiments, employing LPS-induced cytokine storm models, reveal dramatic effects of the two molecules, added in tandem, on mice morbidity, laboratory parameters and mortality. In parallel, significant attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1, IL-1 and TNF-, and reduction of reactive oxygen species were recorded. Importantly, tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate did not completely suppress cytokine generation, but rather brought their concentrations back to baseline levels, further maintaining core immune functions, including phagocytosis. The anti-inflammatory effects of tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate were mediated through downregulation of TLR4, IL-1R, and TNFR signaling pathways and increased A20 expression, attenuating NF-B level. In addition, the two molecules had a significant impact on mice microbiome, increasing the abundance of the genus Bactericides, known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties.

The secondary study objective was to determine if the educational video affected various factors associated with organ donation. Methods: New York City residents were recruited via a crowdsourcing online platform and randomized to one of two groups, with exposure to viewing (1) an educational video before completing an 81 question survey on organ donation (\\"video first\\" condition) or (2) after completing the survey (\\"video last\\" condition). Logistic regression analysis compared organ donation intent (i.e., \\"how likely are you to become an organ donor\\") between the two groups. Additional variables related to organ donation (e.g., religious beliefs, financial incentives) were also evaluated between the two groups. Analyses were adjusted for organ donation registration status. Results: In total, 1905 participants were randomized. We observed a statistically significant increased odds of organ donation intent among those randomized to the video first condition compared with those randomized to the video last condition (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.29 to 2.24).

RESULTS: In total, 134 individuals participated in the study. At 5 weeks, a reduction in role function was seen for individuals who fully (MSD -8, 95% CI: -16 to 0) and to a large extent (MSD -19, 95% CI: -26 to -12) complied with the recommendations. Less fatigue (MSD 9, 95% CI: 3-15) was also detected for this group. Being female, elderly, having comorbidities, living in a region with higher COVID-19 incidence, living in a villa, and being considered as an at-risk person were related to changes in role function. At 13 weeks, reductions in role function continued for those who fully complied with the recommendations (MSD -10, 95% CI: -19 to -1), but the risk variables were of less importance. Improvements in fatigue were no longer detected. Global quality of life, emotional function, or insomnia remained stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that individuals who undergone surgery for esophageal cancer and fully or to a large extent complied with the recommendations experienced reductions in role function, but not in global quality of life or emotional function, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic and health-related quality of life among esophageal cancer survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structural and intracellular proteins of the murine hepatitis viruses MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 were studied by tryptic peptide mapping.

METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, whose demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory data (arterial lactate, bicarbonate, and plasma thiamine) were obtained in the first hours of admission to the intensive care unit. Patients with diabetes were compared with individuals without diabetes, and the correlation was performed between thiamine and lactate levels. Thiamine levels <28 g/L were considered as thiamine deficiency. RESULTS: Overall, 270 patients met the inclusion criteria; 51.1% were men, and the median age was 74 years (66.8-81). The median value of thiamine was 54.0 g/L (38-72.3), and 15.6% had thiamine deficiency. Among patients with diabetes, 26.3% had thiamine deficiency, and 69.3% had hyperlactatemia. There was an association between thiamine deficiency and diabetes (odds ratio 4.28; 95% CI, 2.08-8.81; P < .001). There was a strong negative correlation between thiamine and arterial lactate in patients with diabetes (r = -0.711, P < .001) and a moderate negative correlation in critically ill patients without diabetes (r = -0.489, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of thiamine deficiency in critically ill patients due to coronavirus disease 2019 is higher in patients with diabetes.

This focused review assesses the current COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of a multi-hit framework and disuses how the SARS-COV-2 virus (causative agent) might impact the brain and potentially interact with other environmental insults. What the long-term consequences of SAR2 COV-2 upon neuronal processes is yet unclear, but emerging evidence is suggesting the possibility of microglial or other inflammatory factors as potentially contributing to neurodegenerative illnesses. Finally, it is critical to consider the impact of the virus in the context of the substantial psychosocial stress that has been associated with the global pandemic. Indeed, the loneliness, fear to the future and loss of social support alone has exerted a massive impact upon individuals, especially the vulnerable very young and the elderly. The substantial upswing in depression, anxiety and eating disorders is evidence of this and in the years to come, this might be matched by a similar spike in dementia, as well as motor and cognitive neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Neuroimmune multi-hit perspective of coronaviral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Physical distancing policies in the state of New South Wales (Australia) were implemented on March 23, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors, and well-being during the early period of this policy. METHODS: A cohort of young people aged 13C19 years from Sydney (N = 582) were prospectively followed for 22 weeks (November 18, 2019, to April 19, 2020). Daily, weekly, and monthly trajectories of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, well-being, and psychological distress were collected via smartphone, using a series of ecological momentary assessments and smartphone sensors. Differences in health and well-being outcomes were compared pre- and post-implementation of physical distancing guidelines. RESULTS: After the implementation of physical distancing measures in NSW, there were significant decreases in physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = .53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .34C.83), increases in social media and Internet use (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15C3.00), and increased screen time based on participants' smartphone screen state.

We investigated potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for each event. Events included 9-21 persons, aged 20-79 years. SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely took place during five out of six events; a possible index case could be identified in four out of five clusters. Limited sequencing data was available, hampering interpretation of results. Indirect contact and droplet transmission (<1.5m) may have caused some cases, but are unlikely to explain the high attack rates. The previously published AirCoV2 model indicated that airborne transmission (via infectious droplets/ aerosols over longer distances (>1.5m)) due to singing is possible in case of supershedder presence ([]1010 RNA copies/mL). Also, airflow expelling respiratory droplets over longer distances (>1.5m) may have influenced transmission. In conclusion, a combination of transmission routes probably caused these five clusters. Proportions attributable to each route cannot be deduced. It is possible that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to singing (partly) led to the high attack rates observed in these clusters.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 attack rates following exposure during singing events in the Netherlands, September-October 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the proliferation of cataclysmic predictions about antibiotic resistance, cases of which are estimated to amount to 12500 per year in France, we herein decided to compare the empirical clinical microbiology data from our institution with estimates and predictions from 10 major international scientific articles and reports.

This resulted in catastrophic financial losses and massive surgical backlog. While multiple groups have shown that ambulatory percutaneous nephrolithotomy (aPCNL) is safe and feasible, to our knowledge, a cost-analysis comparing aPCNL against standard PCNL (sPCNL) has not been performed. Prior to March 2020, our group was not performing routine aPCNL, but to conserve hospital resources, we performed aPCNL more often. Our objective was to compare the safety and cost-effectiveness of sPCNL vs. aPCNL. METHODS: 98 patients underwent PCNL at Indiana University Methodist hospital, a tertiary referral center, by three expert surgeons from January 2020 to September 2020. sPCNL (n=75) and aPCNL (n =23). All patients had at least 30-days of follow up.The primary outcome of the study was to compare the 30-day rates of ED-visits, readmissions, and complications between sPCNL and aPCNL. Secondary outcomes included: cost analysis and stone free rates (SFRs). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSSv26 using independent t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical varaibles.

The urgent issue of the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected the demographic development of the world's countries, is the search for new effective mechanisms for the development of demographic potential, which is not possible without appropriate justification monitoring data. The aim of the study is to analyze trends in demographic processes and assess the reproductive behaviour of the population of Russia and Iran, as well as develop recommendations in the field of monitoring demographic processes, taking into account the need to study their changes as a result of the spread of COVID-19, which seems significant for determining effective directions and measures of demographic policy in terms of increasing the birth rate in Russia and Iran in the postpandemic period. Materials and methods. The article is based on the data of the official national statistics of the countries (the Federal State Statistics Service of the Russian Federation and the Statistical Center of the Islamic Republic of Iran), the international database of the UN Population Division, and sociological information. The general research period is determined by the boundaries from 2000 to 2019. To assess the determination of reproductive behaviour in Russia and Iran, general statistical methods of data analysis were used (for example, indicators of structure, dynamics, implementation of the plan), unique methods of demographic statistics (construction of age and sex pyramids of the population, total fertility rate, and others), methods of sociological research (results are presented as All-Russian sociological research \\"Demographic well-being of Russians\\", conducted with the participation of the authors in 2019-2020 on the territory of 10 constituent entities of Russia). Results. An assessment of fertility trends in Russia and Iran is given, general and specific traits of the character and mechanisms of reproductive behaviour are identified. The substantiation of the improvement of directions and measures of demographic policy is given, taking into account the assessment of its effectiveness. In Russia, it was aimed at increasing the birth rate. In Iran, on the contrary, at decreasing it. In both countries, the policy was very effective -in Russia in 2007-2016. the birth rate for second and subsequent births increased significantly in Iran in the late 1980s-1990s. The decline in fertility was one of the largest in the world. If in Iran the birth rate is now close to the level of simple reproduction of the population (in 2017, the total fertility rate was 2.12), then in Russia, especially after the decline since 2017.

We aim to study (1) changes in global arthroscopic practices, (2) recommendations on reducing risk to patients and health care workers (HCW), (3) changes in follow-up protocols of these patients. Systematic search was carried out by two different reviewers using three different online databases for all studies published in the English language before April 2020. The total number of abstracts screened initially was 314. After screening of these abstracts, a total of 13 studies were included for the systematic review. Numbers of orthopaedic injuries have seen a sharp fall during this time. Most elective surgical facilities were also closed at this time. Most studies have recommended telemedicine as an essential medium of providing continued care to patients during COVID-19. Studies have recommended that a conservative approach should be preferred for most patients with ligament injuries, and alternative procedures that have less requirement for an operating room should be explored. Common recommendation in all studies is that procedures of more elective nature should be postponed to a safer time frame when the transmission of COVID-19 virus in the population has declined. When surgeries are resumed, there is a need for triage of arthroscopy procedures from more important or urgent to less important ones. Elective surgical procedures should preferably be started with patients with no co-morbidities and lesser risk of peri-operative complications. All patients undergoing surgery and health care personnels should have some screening for disease. Attempts should be made to have shortest hospital stay. Choice of anaesthetic procedure should emphasize on minimal aerosolization of the virus. Regional anaesthesia is the preferred choice as far as possible.

Protection of this group from severe COVID-19 is therefore important. However, according to available vaccination guidelines, one should consider to postpone vaccination of patients on or early after chemotherapy, hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HCT) or with graft versus host disease, because of anticipated poor efficacy. Based on previous (non-COVID-19) vaccination studies among hematology patients, we hypothesized that a significant group of patients may acquire sufficient protection following COVID-19 vaccination, despite disease and therapy related immunodeficiencies. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study with 17 cohorts of hematology patients of particular risk for severe COVID-19 who are considered to have no or limited benefit from vaccination. We evaluated humoral immune responses following 2 doses (28 days apart) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna/Spikevax) in 722 patients, at baseline and 28 days after each vaccination as SARS-COV-2 S1- (spike)-specific serum IgG antibody concentrations by bead-based multiplex immune assay. The threshold for adequate antibody response is set at 300 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml according to the international WHO standard, and is associated with virus plaque reducing neutralization test titers of 40 PRNT 50. This study is registered as EudraCT 2021-001072-41, NL76768.029.21. Results: Patient cohorts and corresponding vaccine responses are depicted in Table 1. Vaccine efficacy, as measured by antibody concentration, 4 weeks after the 2 nd mRNA-1273 vaccination was available for 691 out of 722 participants. The majority of patients (389/691; 56%) obtained an S1 antibody titer that is considered adequate (300 BAU/ml). Twenty-nine percent of patients (198/691) did not seroconvert (S1 antibody titer <10 BAU/ml), while the remaining 15% (104/691) did seroconvert but not to sufficient levels (10-300 BAU/ml). Adequate responses were observed in the majority of patients with sickle cell disease using hydroxyurea, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on or early after high dose chemotherapy, patients with myeloproliferative disorders on ruxolitinib, patients with multiple myeloma (MM), including those on daratumumab and those early after high-dose melphalan and autologous HCT, patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and patients with chronic GvHD. Insufficient or absent antibody responses were observed in the majority of AML patients receiving hypomethylating agents, CLL patients on ibrutinib, patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) during or shortly after rituximab-chemotherapy or following BEAM chemotherapy and autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients <6 months after transplantation, and CAR-T cell therapy recipients. However, even in these low-responder groups considerable numbers of patients did mount sufficient antibody titers. In others, titers increased after each of both vaccinations, suggesting that booster vaccination may enhance antibody titers to sufficient levels (Figure 1). Conclusion: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 had significant efficacy in severely immunocompromised hematology patients. Adequate humoral immune responses after two dose vaccination were reached in the majority of patients receiving therapy for sickle cell disease, MPD, MM, CML and AML, in patients early after HCT and in patients with GvHD. We are currently evaluating clinical and immunologic parameters that correlate with sufficient antibody responses, pseudovirus neutralization and SARS-COV-2-specific B and T cell numbers, phenotype and function. Per study design, all participants with absent or insufficient antibody responses (<300 BAU/ml) will receive a booster vaccination 5 months after initial vaccination, and antibody responses to booster vaccinations will be presented as well. Unlike currently available guidelines, COVID-19 vaccination should not be postponed. Moreover, as antibody titers increased after each of both vaccinations, booster vaccination of patients with absent or insufficient antibody responses seems warranted.

The C-terminal 19-kDa region of MSP1 has long been considered one of the major candidate antigens for a malaria blood-stage vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum. However, there is limited information on the C-terminal 19-kDa region of Plasmodium ovale MSP1 (PoMSP1(19)). This study aims to analyze the genetic diversity and immunogenicity of PoMSP1(19). METHODS: A total of 37 clinical Plasmodium ovale isolates including Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri imported from Africa into China and collected during the period 2012C2016 were used. Genomic DNA was used to amplify P. ovale curtisi (poc) msp1(19) (pocmsp1(19)) and P. ovale wallikeri (pow) msp1(19) (powmsp1(19)) genes by polymerase chain reaction. The genetic diversity of pomsp1(19) was analyzed using the GeneDoc version 6 programs. Recombinant PoMSP1(19) (rPoMSP1(19))-glutathione S-transferase (GST) proteins were expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system and analyzed by western blot. Immune responses in BALB/c mice immunized with rPoMSP1(19)-GST were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, antigen-specific T cell responses were assessed by lymphocyte proliferation assays. A total of 49 serum samples from healthy individuals and individuals infected with P. ovale were used for the evaluation of natural immune responses by using protein microarrays. RESULTS: Sequences of pomsp1(19) were found to be thoroughly conserved in all the clinical isolates. rPoMSP1(19) proteins were efficiently expressed and purified as ~ 37-kDa proteins. High antibody responses in mice immunized with rPoMSP1(19)-GST were observed. rPoMSP1(19)-GST induced high avidity indexes, with an average of 92.57% and 85.32% for rPocMSP1(19) and rPowMSP1(19), respectively. Cross-reactivity between rPocMSP1(19) and rPowMSP1(19) was observed. Cellular immune responses to rPocMSP1(19) (69.51%) and rPowMSP1(19) (52.17%) induced in rPocMSP1(19)- and rPowMSP1(19)-immunized mice were found in the splenocyte proliferation assays. The sensitivity and specificity of rPoMSP1(19)-GST proteins for the detection of natural immune responses in patients infected with P. ovale were 89.96% and 75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed highly conserved gene sequences of pomsp1(19). In addition, naturally acquired humoral immune responses against rPoMSP1 were observed in P. ovale infections, and high immunogenicity of rPoMSP1(19) in mice was also identified. These instructive findings should encourage further testing of PoMSP1(19) for rational vaccine design.

To characterize changes in global gene expression in the hearts and kidneys of rtTA/hACE2 double transgenic (dTg) mice in response to hACE2 overexpression, total RNA extracted from these tissues from dTg mice after doxycycline (Dox) treatment was hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. Briefly, dTg mice were generated by cross-mating p-MHC/rtTA Tg mice with pTRE/hACE2 Tg mice. The expression level of hACE2 protein was determined to be high in hearts, kidneys, and brains of dTg mice, whereas lung, liver, and testis tissues expressed low levels. The level of hACE2 was significantly enhanced in hearts and kidneys of the Dox+dTg group compared to that in Vehicle+dTg mice although consistent levels of mouse ACE2 (mACE2) remained in the same tissues. Based on the microarray analysis of heart tissue, 385 genes were differentially expressed, including 168 upregulated and 217 downregulated, when comparing non-Tg and Vehicle+dTg mice, whereas 216 genes were differentially expressed, including 136 upregulated and 80 downregulated, between Vehicle+dTg and Dox+dTg mice. In the kidneys, 402 genes were differentially expressed, including 159 upregulated and 243 downregulated, between non-Tg and Vehicle+dTg mice. Dox-treated dTg mice exhibited the differential expression of 4735 genes including 1636 upregulated and 3109 downregulated. Taken together, these findings suggested that several functional groups and individual genes can be considered biomarkers that respond to hACE2 overexpression in dTg mice. Moreover, our results provided a lot of useful information to predict physiological responses when these dTg mice are applied as a susceptible model for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV, COVID-19) in both vaccine and drug development.","output":"Characterization of changes in global gene expression in the hearts and kidneys of transgenic mice overexpressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients pursuing solid organ transplantation are encouraged to receive many vaccines on an accelerated timeline. Vaccination prior to transplantation offers the best chance of developing immunity and may expand the pool of donor organs that candidates can accept without needing post-transplant therapy. Furthermore, transplant recipients are at greater risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable illnesses or succumbing to severe sequelae of such illnesses. However, a rising rate of vaccine refusal has challenged transplant centers to address the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Transplant centers may need to consider adopting a policy of denial of solid organ transplantation on the basis of vaccine refusal for non-medical reasons (i.e., philosophical or religious objections or personal beliefs that vaccines are unnecessary or unsafe). Arguments supporting such a policy are motivated by utility, stewardship, and beneficence. Arguments opposing such a policy emphasize justice and respect for persons, and seek to avoid worsening inequities or medical coercion. This paper examines these arguments and situates them within the special cases of pediatric transplantation, emergent transplantation, and living donation. Ultimately, a uniform national policy addressing vaccine refusal among transplant candidates is needed to resolve this ethical dilemma and establish a consistent, fair, and standard approach to vaccine refusal in transplantation.","output":"The limits of refusal: An ethical review of solid organ transplantation and vaccine hesitancy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vinegar is a natural product widely used in food and traditional medicine thanks to its physicochemical properties and its richness in bioactive molecules. However, its direct use by consumers can have complications and undesirable effects. Therefore, this study contributes to investigating the physicochemical and biological properties of eleven vinegars marketed in Morocco. Determination of pH, acetic acid, conductivity, total soluble solids and alcohol content in vinegar was carried out. The polyphenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), and condensed tannins (CT) content was determined, and their antioxidant activities were evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl Hydrazyl (DPPH), Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and Phosphomolybdenum Reduction Assay (TAC). Then, the antimicrobial activity was studied against four pathogenic bacteria and two fungal strains, using the disk diffusion and the microdilution method. This study showed a wide range of acetic acid values from 0.65  0.29 to 5.15  0.20%. The high value of TP, TF, and CT in our samples V10, V9, and V4 was 655.00  22.2 gGAE/mL, 244.53  11.32 gQE/mL and 84.63  1.00 gTAE/mL, respectively. The tested strains showed variable sensitivities to the different samples with inhibition zones ranging from 6.33  2.08 to 34.33  0.58 mm. The lowest minimum inhibition concentrations were recorded against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213 ranging from 1.95 to 7.81 L/mL.

Although public evaluation frameworks and ratings exist, they do not facilitate digital companion choice based on contextual or individual information, such as occupation or personal management strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to establish a process for creating a taxonomy to support systematic choice of digital companions for teachers stress self-management. METHODS: We used a 4-step study design. In step 1, we identified the dimension of stress self-management and strategic classifications. In step 2, we identified the dimension of the digital techniques and conceptual descriptions. In step 3, we created 6 criteria for the inclusion of digital companions. In step 4, we used the taxonomy framework created by steps 1 and 2 and populated it with digital companions for stress self-management, as identified in step 3. RESULTS: First, in the dimension of stress self-management, we identified four classes of strategies: educational, physiological, cognitive, and social. Second, in the digital techniques dimension, we derived four conceptual descriptions for the digital companions mechanisms of action: fostering reflection, suggesting treatment, peer-to-peer support, and entertainment. Third, we created six criteria for digital companion inclusion in the taxonomy: suitability, availability, evaluation, security, validity, and cost. Using the taxonomy framework and criteria, we populated it with digital companions for stress management ahead of presentation to teachers in a stress study workshop. CONCLUSIONS: The elements of our approach can be generalized as principles for the creation of taxonomies for other occupations or conditions. Taxonomies such as this could be a valuable resource for individuals to understand which digital companion could be of help in their personal context.","output":"Digital Companion Choice to Support Teachers Stress Self-management: Systematic Approach Through Taxonomy Creation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The described work aimed to avoid cancellations of indispensable treatments by implementing active patient flow management practices and optimizing infrastructure utilization in the radiation oncology department of a large university hospital and regional COVID-19 treatment center close to the first German SARS-CoV?2 hotspot region Heinsberg in order to prevent nosocomial infections in patients and personnel during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised year-to-date intervention analyses of in- and outpatient key procedures, machine occupancy, and no-show rates in calendar weeks 12 to 19 of 2019 and 2020 to evaluate effects of active patient flow management while monitoring nosocomial COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Active patient flow management helped to maintain first-visit appointment compliance above 85.5%. A slight appointment reduction of 10.3% daily (p = 0.004) could still significantly increase downstream planning CT scheduling (p = 0.00001) and performance (p = 0.0001), resulting in an absolute 20.1% (p = 0.009) increment of CT performance while avoiding overbooking practices. Daily treatment start was significantly increased by an absolute value of 18.5% (p = 0.026). Hypofractionation and acceleration were significantly increased (p = 0.0043). Integrating strict testing guidelines, a distancing regimen for staff and patients, hygiene regulations, and precise appointment scheduling, no SARS-CoV?2 infection in 164 tested radiation oncology service inpatients was observed. CONCLUSION: In times of reduced medical infrastructure capacities and resources, controlling infrastructural time per patient as well as optimizing facility utilization and personnel workload during treatment evaluation, planning, and irradiation can help to improve appointment compliance and quality management. Avoiding recurrent and preventable exposure to healthcare infrastructure has potential health benefits and might avert cross infections during the pandemic. Active patient flow management in high-risk COVID-19 regions can help Radiation Oncologists to continue and initiate treatments safely, instead of cancelling and deferring indicated therapies.","output":"Managing patient flows in radiation oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Reworking existing treatment designs to prevent infections at a German hot spot area University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine how information from trusted social media sources can shape knowledge and behavior when misinformation and mistrust are widespread.

We examine how exposure to these messages affects individuals' beliefs about how to deal with the virus and preventative behavior. In a survey of 864 survey respondents, we find a 0.26&#963; increase in knowledge about COVID-19 as measured by responses to factual questions. Through a list experiment embedded in the survey, we further find that potentially harmful behavior-not abiding by lockdown guidelines-decreased by 30 percentage points.

METHODS: Data were collected by a retrospective chart review of children diagnosed with West syndrome between January 2017 to January 2018. Information was recorded pertaining to the age at onset and presentation, etiology, and associated co-morbidities; results of electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging; treatment given; and final outcome. The following drugs were used for treatment: ACTH (n = 7), prednisolone (n = 17), vigabatrin (n = 25), sodium valproate (n = 28), clonazepam (n = 30), and levetiracetam (n = 13) and modified Atkins diet (n = 7). The response was categorized as spasm cessation, partial improvement (>50% improvement), or no improvement. RESULTS: Records of 30 children (21 boys) were analyzed. The median (IQR) age at onset was 4 (3, 6.5) months. The median (IQR) lag time to treatment was 5 (2,14) months. Eight (26%) were premature, 2 (7%) were small for gestational age, birth asphyxia in 56%, neonatal encephalopathy in 62%. EEG findings were hypsarrhythmia in 13 (43.3%) children and modified hypsarrhythmia in 9 (30%) children. MRI finding was periventricular leukomalacia (54.1%), cystic encephalomalacia (13.8%), normal MRI (20.7%) and one had arrested hydrocephalus. There was no improvement with valproate (93%), clonazepam (89%), levetiracetam (78%). Cessation of spasm was achieved with vigabatrin (28%), prednisolone (38.2%), ACTH (42.8%). Hypsarrhythmia resolved with improvement in of background and other epileptiform abnormalities in 17 children. CONCLUSION: The present research highlights favourable response of West syndrome to oral steroids, vigabatrin and ACTH with limited role of conventional antiepileptic drugs like sodium valporate, levetiracetam and clonazepam.

This viral infection (COVID-19) is not the only cause of deaths in this pandemic. A usual complication of viral infections is a secondary superimposed bacterial infection or a superinfection. Based on limited published data, the relatively high incidence of severe infection and mortality in COVID-19 patients is attributed to these infections. It is reasonable to anticipate that nearly half of the patients who have died from COVID-19 had superinfection. Patients who have severe form of the disease and those requiring prolonged stay in intensive care units (ICUs) are more prone to developing super added infection by nosocomial pathogens. The most common type of infection observed among COVID-19 patients is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), followed by bacteremia with sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to keep these infections at bay which is promoting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In developing countries like India, where there is well-established high burden of multidrug-resistant organisms in hospital settings, superinfections in COVID-19 patients can pose a biggest challenge in the treatment leading to increase mortality. There is a need of prospective studies, which should include clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological data on superinfections that can be used in forming effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies;which can have a crucial role in optimal antimicrobial prescribing.","output":"Superinfections in COVID-19 Patients: Role of Antimicrobials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The current pandemic makes the international flights facing multiple challenges including infection during flights.

Moreover, the correlation between serologic response and status of cellular immunity has been poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess humoral immune and cellular responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination in CLL. METHODS: The presence of the spike antibodies was assessed at a median time of 14 days from the second vaccine dose of SARS-CoV-2 in 70 CLL patients followed up at a single institution. RESULTS: The antibody response rate (RR) in CLL patients was 58.5%, compared to 100% of 57 healthy controls of the same sex and age (p < 0.0001). Treatment-na?ve patients and those in sustained clinical remission after therapy had the highest RR (87.0% and 87.7%, respectively). In contrast, patients on therapy with a pathway inhibitor as monotherapy and those treated with an association of anti-CD20 antibody were unlikely to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (52% and 10%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, early Rai stage (OR, 0.19 [0.05C0.79]; p = 0.02) and no previous therapy (OR, 0.06 [0.02C0.27]; p < 0.0001) were found to be independent predictors of vaccination response. An increase in absolute NK cells (i.e., CD16/CD56 positive cells) in patients with a serological response was found following the second dose of vaccine (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that serological response to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with CLL is impaired.

Mapping the precise identity, location, and abundance of modified ribonucleotides remains a key goal of many studies aimed at characterizing the function and importance of a given modification. While mapping of specific RNA modifications through short-read sequencing approaches has powered a wealth of new discoveries in the past decade, this approach is limited by inherent biases and an absence of linkage information. Moreover, in viral contexts, the challenge is increased due to the compact nature of viral genomes giving rise to many overlapping transcript isoforms that cannot be adequately resolved using short-read sequencing approaches. The recent emergence of nanopore sequencing, specifically the ability to directly sequence native RNAs from virus-infected host cells, provides not just a new methodology for mapping modified ribonucleotides but also a new conceptual framework for what can be derived from the resulting sequencing data. In this minireview, we provide a detailed overview of how nanopore direct RNA sequencing works, the computational approaches applied to identify modified ribonucleotides, and the core concepts underlying both. We further highlight recent studies that have applied this approach to interrogating viral biology and finish by discussing key experimental considerations and how we predict that these methodologies will continue to evolve.","output":"Nanopore-Based Detection of Viral RNA Modifications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiotocography data uncertainty is a critical task for the classification in biomedical field.

This study describes the characteristics of healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested positive for COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of HCWs with COVID-19. RESULTS: During the study period, 204 HCWs tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR test, with a test positivity rate of 21.2%; the percentage of infected hospital staff was 4.3%. Their mean age was 36 years. Overall, 2.2% of the male staff were infected, while 9.3% of the female staff were infected. Among the clinicians, 4.7% were infected; among the nurses, 4.1% were infected. Regarding acquisition, 61.3% of infections (n = 125) were community-acquired and 25.5% (n = 52) were hospital-acquired; no source was identified in 13.2% of cases (n = 27). There was a significant difference between hospital-acquired and community-acquired COVID-19 according to the different HCW categories (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.041), and being at risk of COVID-19 exposure in the hospital (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in relation to nationality (p = 0498), age (p = 0.119), or the presence of co-morbidities (p = 0.326).

However, the successful development of a young footballer is largely dependent upon the roles and relationships of the different stakeholders invested in the developmental process. This study examined the level of horizontal (i.e., extent to which stakeholders across a pathway stage work with players in an agreed fashion to optimize their experience) and vertical (i.e., extent to which multiple stages of the pathway are coordinated and build chronologically from previous involvement toward long-term needs) stakeholder coherence throughout the Irish football player pathway following a restructuring of development policies and the implementation of a nationwide academy system between 2016 and 2020 under the Football Association of Ireland's (FAI) Player Development Plan. As a second aim, we explored each of the key stakeholders' alignment to academic talent development principles in order to provide practical recommendations for future player and coach development policies. Accordingly, a series of interviews were conducted with 31 key stakeholders currently engaged in the player pathway. These key stakeholders consisted of parents, coaches and members of the FAI as the National Governing Body for football in Ireland. Data were analyzed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, with findings highlighting a lack of stakeholder coherence across the pathway, both vertically and horizontally. Stakeholders displayed inconsistency in their understanding of the purpose of the player pathway and its long-term strategic aims, as well as demonstrating poor and incohesive relationships with each of the different stakeholders.

METHOD: Meta-analysis was used to analyze the five eligible articles. The modified Jadad scoring scale was used to evaluate the quality of eligible literature with a scoring system of 1 to 7. The primary endpoint of the effectiveness index was GMT. The primary endpoints of the safety index were the incidence of local AEs and systemic AEs. Stata 12.0 software was used for meta-analysis. Revman 5.0 software was used to map the risk of publication bias, and Eggers test was used to analyze publication bias. RESULTS: The GMT values of young adults were higher than older adults (SMD = 1.40, 95% CI (0.79, 2.02), P<0.01). There was a higher incidence of local and systemic AEs in young people than in the elderly (OR = 1.10, 95% CI (1.08, 1.12), P<0.01; OR = 1.18, 95% CI (1.14, 1.22), P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The immune effect of young people after being vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines was better than that of the elderly, but the safety was worse than that of old people, the most common AEs were fever, rash, and local muscle pain, which were tolerable for young people. As the AEs of the elderly were lower, they can also be vaccinated safely; the reason for the low level of GMT in the elderly was related to Immunosenescence.

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

Human transmission of this virus occurs via respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which are released into the environment after sneezing or coughing. These droplets are capable of staying in the air as aerosols or surfaces and can be transmitted to persons through inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces. Thus, there is an urgent need for advanced theranostic solutions to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. The development of such fit-for-purpose technologies hinges on a proper understanding of the transmission, incubation, and structural characteristics of the virus in the external environment and within the host. Hence, this article describes the development of an intrinsic model to describe the incubation characteristics of the virus under varying environmental factors. It also discusses on the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 structural nucleocapsid protein properties via computational approaches to generate high-affinity binding probes for effective diagnosis and targeted treatment applications by specific targeting of viruses.

The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: As of data cut-off on April 14, 2021, 626 pts were enrolled in the study;562 were eligible for primary endpoint assessment, n (%): M/F 271 (48%) / 291 (52%), median age 56 [18-90] years, malignant disease in 516 (92%) pts, among them induction phase / relapse or refractory / remission / NA in 180 (35%) / 120 (23%) / 187 (36%) / 29 (6%) pts. Thirty-day all-cause mortality in pts with hem malignancies was 19%;83% of deaths were due to COVID-19 complications. No increase of hem disease relapse rate after COVID-19 was observed at Day 90 or Day 180, although 180-day data was still not mature at the time of analysis. IgG to SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 84% of pts with hem malignancies (167/199). The highest rate of detected antibody immunity was found in pts with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (100%;13/13), HL (100%;12/12), and multiple myeloma (97%;34/35), the lowest C in pts with CLL (62%;8/13) and NHL (60%;6/10 and 56%;10/18 for low-grade and high-grade lymphoma, respectively). igG detection rate in CD20+ lymphoma (60%) was significantly lower than in HL or T-cell lymphoma (p=0.004).

FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2020, and Aug 8, 2021, of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29C61]; 1 799 395 [524%] female and 1 637 394 [476%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72C74) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89C92). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86C89) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43C51) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85C97]) but declined to 53% [39C65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95C99), but waned to 67% (45C80) at 4C5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84C96]) up to 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.

We investigated if the radiotherapy-augmented Warburg effect helped myeloid cells acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype, resulting in limited treatment efficacy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Radiotherapy enhanced the tumor-promoting activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pancreatic cancer. Sustained increase in lactate secretion, resulting from the radiation-augmented Warburg effect, was responsible for the enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSCs after radiotherapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) was essential for tumor cell metabolism and lactate-regulated activation of MDSCs via the G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/HIF-1&#945;/STAT3 pathway. Blocking lactate production in tumor cells or deleting Hif-1&#945; in MDSCs reverted antitumor T cell responses and effectively inhibited tumor progression after radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Our investigation highlighted the importance of radiation-induced lactate in regulating the inhibitory immune microenvironment of PDAC.

We sought to determine the impact of pulmonary function tests upon complications after thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS A model for morbidity, including published preoperative risk factors and surgical approach, was developed by multivariable logistic regression. All patients who underwent lobectomy for primary lung cancer between December 1999 and October 2007 with preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or diffusion capacity to carbon monoxide (Dlco) 60% or less predicted were reviewed. Preoperative, histopathologic, perioperative, and outcome variables were assessed using standard descriptive statistics. Pulmonary complications were defined as atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy, pneumonia, reintubation, and tracheostomy. RESULTS During the study period, 340 patients (median age 67) with Dlco or FEV1 60% or less (mean % predicted FEV1, 55+/-1; mean % predicted Dlco, 61+/-1) underwent lobectomy (173 thoracoscopy, 167 thoracotomy). Operative mortality was 5% (17 patients) and overall morbidity was 48% (164 patients). At least one pulmonary complication occurred in 57 patients (17%). Significant predictors of pulmonary complications by multivariable analysis for all patients included Dlco (odds ratio 1.03, p=0.003), FEV1 (odds ratio 1.04, p=0.003), and thoracotomy as surgical approach (odds ratio 3.46, p=0.0007). When patients were analyzed according to operative approach, Dlco and FEV1 remained significant predictors of pulmonary morbidity for patients undergoing thoracotomy but not thoracoscopy.

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the landscape of response to OHCAs, particularly with regard to providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We aimed to describe, characterize, and address the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers towards CPR of OHCA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers and trainees in the United States and Saudi Arabia via an online survey available between October 2020, and May 2021. The primary outcome of interest was willingness to perform CPR for OHCA, with confidence to handle CPR for OHCA as our secondary outcome. Results A total of 501 healthcare professionals, including 436 (87%) with background in emergency medicine, participated in our survey. 331 (66%) reported being willing to perform CPR for OHCA, while 170 (34%) were not willing. 311 (94%) willing participants stated that their medical oath and moral responsibility were the main motivators for willingness, while a fear of contracting COVID-19 was the primary demotivating factor for 126 (74%) unwilling participants. Time series analysis with simple exponential smoothing showed an increase in willingness to perform CPR from 30% to 50%, as well as an increase in mean confidence level to perform CPR from 60% to 70%, between October 2020 and May 2021. Conclusions The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected healthcare workers' attitudes towards performing CPR for OHCA. Confidence levels and willingness to perform CPR increased over time during the study period. Efforts should be directed towards the creation of standardized and evidence-based guidelines for CPR during COVID-19, as well as increasing knowledge regarding risks of infection and effective use of PPE during resuscitation.","output":"Attitudes among healthcare professionals towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using Googles recently introduced COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, we test the effects of stay-at-home activity on the US stock market outcomes.

This test began with recording, transcribing, and subjectively scoring participants' verbal descriptions, which consistently found ToM-specific difficulties in ASD. More recently in 2011, White et al. created a more objective version of this ToM test using multiple-choice questions. However, there has been surprisingly little uptake of this test, hence it is currently unclear if White et al.'s findings replicate. Further, the lack of an online version of the test may be hampering its use in large-scale studies and outside of research settings. Addressing these issues, we report the development of a web-based version of the Frith-Happ Animations Test for autistic and neurotypical adults. An online version of the test was developed in a large general population sample (study 1; N = 285) and online data were compared with those collected in a lab-based setting (study 2; N = 339). The new online test was then administered to adults with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and matched neurotypical controls (study 3; N = 231). Results demonstrated that the test could successfully be administered online to autistic adults, who showed ToM difficulties compared to neurotypical adults, replicating White et al.'s findings. Overall, we have developed a quicker, more objective, and web-based version of the Frith-Happ Animations Test that will be useful for social cognition research within and beyond the field of autism, with potential utility for clinical settings. LAY SUMMARY: Many autistic people find it hard to understand what other people are thinking. There are many tests for this 'mentalising' ability, but they often take a long time to complete and cannot be used outside of research settings. In 2011, scientists used short silent animations of moving shapes to create a fast way to measure mentalising ability.

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review to update and summarise evidence on trends in health expectancies, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income countries. DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, 1946C19 September 2019; Embase 1980C2019 week 38; Scopus 1966C22 September 2019, Health Management Information Consortium, 1979CSeptember 2019), and the UK Office for National Statistics website (November 2019). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: English language studies published from 2016 that reported trends in healthy, active and/or disability-free life expectancy in an OECD high-income country. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Records were screened independently by two researchers. Study quality was assessed using published criteria designed to identify sources of bias in studies reporting trends, and evidence summarised by narrative synthesis. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight publications from 11 countries were included, covering periods from 6 to 40 years, between 1970 and 2017. In most countries, gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy do not match the growth in total life expectancy. Exceptions were demonstrated for women in Sweden, where there were greater gains in disability-free years than life expectancy. Gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy were greater for men than women in most countries except the USA (age 85), Japan (birth), Korea (age 65) and Sweden (age 77). CONCLUSION: An expansion of disability in later life is evident in a number of high-income countries, with implications for the sustainability of health and care systems.

Therefore, we aimed to obtain patient feedback to guide successful trial design, recruitment, retention, and for identifying potential barriers to study participation. METHODS Over 1000 members of an international laryngotracheal stenosis online support community (the Living with Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis Facebook group) were sent two questionnaires for a proposed interventional double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. RESULTS A total of 317 and 558 participants responded to the first and second surveys, respectively. The majority of participants (77%) were willing to consider enrollment, regardless of having a 50% chance of receiving placebo versus treatment (78%).

Therefore, the reduction, storage, and reuse of CO2 is an important concern in modern society. Calcium oxide (CaO) is known to be an excellent adsorbent of CO2 in a high-temperature environment. However, since deterioration of the adsorbent is likely to occur after repeated cycles of adsorption under high temperature conditions, it would be desirable to mitigate this phenomenon, in order to maintain the stability of CaO. In the present study, common eggshell waste was used as the starting material. The main component of eggshell waste is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which was purified to produce CaO. Different surfactants and amino-containing polymers were added to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents with different configurations and pore sizes. The amount of CO2 adsorbed was determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the synthetic CaO recovered from purified eggshell waste could reach 0.6 g-CO2/g-sorbent, indicating a good adsorption capacity. CaO modified with a dopamine-containing polymer was shown to have an adsorption capacity of 0.62 g-CO2/g-sorbent. Moreover, it showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 0.40 g-CO2/g-sorbent, even after 10 cycles of CO2 adsorption. The present study suggests that using eggshell waste to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents for effective CO2 adsorption can not only reduce environmental waste, but also have the potential to capture greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, which conforms to the principles of green chemistry.","output":"CaO recovered from eggshell waste as a potential adsorbent for greenhouse gas CO2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in China in January 2020 and has been effectively controlled in April 2020 after China's relentless efforts.

Here in the current investigation, we intended to reveal if MMPs are potentially involved in the development of neurological symptoms in the patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The levels of MMPs, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules were evaluated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 10 COVID-19 patients with neurological syndrome (NS) and 10 COVID-19 patients lacking NS. Monocytes from the CSF samples were treated with TNF- and the secreted levels of MMPs were determined. RESULTS: The frequency of monocytes were increased in the CSF samples of COVID-19 patients with NS compared to patients without NS. Levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL12, CXCL8, and CX3CL1, MMPs MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-12, and adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were significantly increased in the CSF samples of COVID-19 patients with NS compared with patients without NS. Treatment of CSF-derived monocytes obtained from COVID-19 patients with NS caused increased production of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-12. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of inflammatory cytokines might promote the expression of adhesion molecules on blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB), resulting in facilitation of monocyte recruitment. Increased levels of CSF chemokines might also help to the trafficking of monocytes to CSF. Inflammatory cytokines might enhance production of MMPs from monocytes, leading to disruption of BCSFB (and therefore further infiltration of inflammatory cells to CSF) in COVID-19 patients with NS.","output":"Matrix metalloproteinases are involved in the development of neurological complications in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous lessons have been learned so far in controlling H5N1 avian influenza in Asia. Early detection of incursions of virus prevented establishment of the disease in several countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. In countries where detection of early cases was delayed, infection is endemic and has been for three or more years. Control measures implemented in these countries need to reflect this finding. Vaccination will continue to be one of the key measures used in these endemically infected countries. Used alone, vaccination will not result in elimination of H5N1 viruses from a country, but, if used correctly, it will markedly reduce the prevalence of and susceptibility to infection. Vaccination has already played a valuable role in reducing the adverse effects of H5N1 viruses. Mass culling also reduces the level of infection in infected areas. However, the long-term benefits are limited in endemically infected countries owing to the high probability of reinfection on restocking unless other measures are used in parallel. Full epidemiological studies have not been conducted in many infected countries. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the number of clinical cases does not truly reflect the levels of infection. Domestic ducks and large live poultry markets have played a key role in the persistence of infection, because they can be infected silently. In tackling this disease, countries should adopt integrated control programs using the combination of measures best suited to the local environment. All surveillance data should be shared, both positive and negative, and should include information on cases of infection and disease. Socioeconomic and ecological implications of all control measures should be assessed before implementation, especially the impact on the rural poor.","output":"Lessons learned from Asian H5N1 outbreak control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we tried to see and characterize potential threats to digital activism in the internet-active nation of Indonesia by doing network analysis on a recent digital activism event on Twitter, which protested against a recent law related to alcoholic beverage investment.

Here, we tested this prediction by using state-dependent millisecond-resolved real-time electroencephalography-triggered dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) (Zrenner et al., 2018) to target the EEG-negative (high-excitability state) versus EEG-positive peak (low-excitability state) of the sensorimotor -rhythm in the left (conditioning) and right (test) motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy human subjects (9 female, 7 male). Effective connectivity was tested by short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI); that is, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning TMS pulse given 10-12 ms before the test pulse on the test motor-evoked potential. We compared the four possible combinations of excitability states (negative peak, positive peak) and phase relations (in-phase, out-of-phase) of the -rhythm in the conditioning and test M1 and a random phase condition. Strongest SIHI was found when the two M1 were in phase for the high-excitability state (negative peak of the -rhythm), whereas the weakest SIHI occurred when they were out of phase and the conditioning M1 was in the low-excitability state (positive peak). Phase synchronicity contributed significantly to SIHI variation, with stronger SIHI in the in-phase than out-of-phase conditions. These findings are in exact accord with the predictions of the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route for highly effective modification of brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time when nodes in the network are phase synchronized and excitable.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in distributed oscillating brain networks depends on their instantaneous excitability and phase relation. We tested this hypothesis in healthy human subjects by real-time analysis of brain states by electroencephalography in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation of left and right motor cortex. We found that short-interval interhemispheric inhibition, a marker of interhemispheric effective connectivity, was maximally expressed when the two motor cortices were in phase for a high-excitability state (the trough of the sensorimotor -rhythm). We conclude that findings are consistent with the theory of communication through coherence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recent studies and data are analyzed and an overview of the most common signs and patterns in chest X?ray is provided. RESULTS: Knowledge about common signs and patterns in chest X?ray is helpful in the diagnosis of pneumonias and can be indicative for the cause of an infection. However, those signs are often unspecific and should, therefore, be set in clinical content. Computed tomography is becoming increasingly important in the primary diagnosis of pulmonary lesions because of its much higher sensitivity.

Hospitalized children clinically diagnosed with LRTI in Chengdu Women and Children's Central Hospital from 2011 to 2020 were selected as the study subjects. The pathogens of LRTI in children and the distribution of pathogens in different ages, genders, seasons, years, and departments and before and after the pandemic situation of COVID-19 were counted. The drug resistance distribution of the top six pathogens with the highest infection rate in the past three years and the trend of drug resistance in the past decade were analyzed. A total of 26,469 pathogens were isolated. Among them, 6240 strains (23.6%) were Gram-positive bacteria, 20152 strains (76.1%) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 73 strains (0.3%) were fungi. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus were highly isolated in the group of infants aged 0-1 (P < 0.01), Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly isolated in children aged 1C6 (P < 0.01), and Haemophilus influenzae was highly isolated in children over 1 (P < 0.01). The isolation rates of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans in the lower respiratory tract of 0-1 year-old male infants were higher than those of female infants (p < 0.05). Haemophilus influenzae was highly isolated in spring and summer, and Moraxella catarrhalis was highly isolated in autumn and winter, while the infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae was mainly concentrated in winter. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the isolation rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly lower than those before the pandemic, and the isolation rate of Moraxella catarrhalis was significantly higher. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The proportion of isolated negative bacteria in NICU and PICU was higher than that in positive bacteria, and the infection rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter baumannii were higher than those in other departments. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of drug sensitivity test showed that the drug resistance of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was mainly concentrated in Ampicillin, First- and Second-generation cephalosporins, and Cotrimoxazole, with stable sensitivity to Third-generation cephalosporins, while the drug resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae was concentrated in Macrolides, Sulfonamides, and Tetracyclines, with stable sensitivity to Penicillin. Staphylococcus aureus is highly resistant to penicillins and macrolides and susceptible to vancomycin. Enterobacteriaceae resistance is concentrated in cephalosporins, with a low rate of carbapenem resistance. From 2018 to 2020, 1557 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated, of which 416 strains were MRSA, accounting for 27% of the isolates; 1064 strains of Escherichia coli were isolated, of which 423 strains were ESBL and 23 strains were CRE, accounting for 40% and 2% of the isolates, respectively; and 1400 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated, of which 385 strains were ESBL and 402 strains were CRE, accounting for 28% and 29% of the isolates, respectively. Since 2011, the resistance of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to Third-generation cephalosporins has increased, peaking in 2017, and has decreased after 2018, years after which carbapenem resistance has increased significantly, corresponding to an increase in the detection rate of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae CRE. Findings from this study revealed that there are significant differences in community-associated infectious pathogens before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are significant age differences, seasonal epidemic trends, and high departmental correlation of pathogens related to lower respiratory tract disease infection in children. There was a significant gender difference in the isolation rate of pathogens associated with LRTI in infants under one year. Vaccination, implementation of isolation measures and social distance, strengthening of personal protective measures, aseptic operation of invasive medical treatment, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection are beneficial to reducing community-associated pathogen infection, opportunistic pathogen infection, and an increase in resistant bacteria. The strengthening of bacterial culture of lower respiratory tract samples by pediatricians is conducive to the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections caused by different pathogens, contributing to the selection of effective drugs for treatment according to drug susceptibility results, which is important for the rational use of antibiotics and curbing bacterial resistance.","output":"Distribution and Drug Resistance of Bacterial Pathogens Associated with Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Children and the Effect of COVID-19 on the Distribution of Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is constantly a need to improve the success rate of SMEs in Malaysia.

Sambucus FormosanaNakai, a species of elderberry, is a traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antiviral potential. The study investigated the antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai stem ethanol extract and some phenolic acid constituents against HCoV-NL63. The extract was less cytotoxic and concentration-dependently increased anti-HCoV-NL63 activities, including cytopathicity, sub-G1 fraction, virus yield (IC50 = 1.17 g/ml), plaque formation (IC50 = 4.67 g/ml) and virus attachment (IC50 = 15.75 g/ml). Among the phenolic acid constituents in Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid sustained the anti-HCoV-NL63 activity that was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid (IC(50) = 3.54 M) > chlorogenic acid (IC(50) = 43.45 M) > coumaric acid (IC(50) = 71.48 M). Caffeic acid significantly inhibited the replication of HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner, and specifically blocked virus attachment (IC(50) = 8.1 M).

The viral envelope (E) protein, the principal surface protein of viral particles, plays a vital role in viral entry and fusion. In this study, two peptides derived from domain II (DII) and the stem of the TMUV envelope protein, TP1 and TP2, respectively, were tested for their antiviral activity. TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV infection in BHK-21 cells, and their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 14.19 mg/L and 7.64 mg/L, respectively. Viral inhibition assays in different cell lines of avian origin showed that the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 are not cell type dependent. Moreover, TP2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. The two peptides inhibited antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) indicated that both peptides interact with the surface of the TMUV virion. RNase digestion assays confirmed the release of viral RNA following incubation with TP1, while incubation with TP1 or TP2 interfered with the binding between TMUV and cells.

Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks. We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland. From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48/86 (56%). 42/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions. The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services.

Although the causes for burnout are multifactorial, a key issue that affects physicians is that they spend a significant proportion of their time interacting with their electronic health record (EHR) system, primarily because of the need to sift through increasing amounts of patient data, coupled with a significant documentation burden. This has led to physicians spending increasing amounts of time with the EHR outside working hours trying to catch up on paperwork (pajama time), which is a factor linked to burnout. In this paper, we propose an innovative model of EHR training using high-fidelity EHR simulations designed to facilitate efficient optimization of EHR use by clinicians and emphasize the importance of both lifelong learning and physician well-being.","output":"Using a New Model of Electronic Health Record Training to Reduce Physician Burnout: A Plan for Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the role of individual differences in horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, trust and worries, and concerns about COVID-19 in predicting the attitudes toward compliance of health advice and psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the percentage of COVID-19 positive patients that were hospitalized within a three-week period after discharge from ED to self-quarantine. METHODS: The patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab and were discharged from ED of a tertiary care hospital in the USA to self-quarantine from March 01- July 31, 2020, were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on serum albumin levels and were followed up for three weeks to see if low level of albumin increased the risk of hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study the effect of albumin level and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included in the study out of which 65 had low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL) and 47 had normal serum albumin (&#8805;3.5 g/dL). More than 10% of patients discharged to self-quarantine needed hospitalization within three weeks. The Low albumin group had more co-morbidities at baseline. The low serum albumin group had 10 (15.38%) vs 2 (4.26%), p = 0.06 hospitalizations as compared to the normal serum albumin group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal lower odds of hospitalization in the group with normal albumin, (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03-1.92, p = 0.19) after controlling for age, sex, and various co-morbidities.

Any improvement in functional outcome distribution has value, and herein we provide an assessment of the effect of alteplase on the distribution of the functional level by treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. METHODS Prespecified pooled analysis of 6756 patients from 9 randomized trials comparing alteplase versus placebo/open control. Ordinal logistic regression models assessed treatment differences after adjustment for treatment delay, age, stroke severity, and relevant interaction term(s). RESULTS Treatment with alteplase was beneficial for a delay in treatment extending to 4.5 hours after stroke onset, with a greater benefit with earlier treatment. Neither age nor stroke severity significantly influenced the slope of the relationship between benefit and time to treatment initiation. For the observed case mix of patients treated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset (mean 3 hours and 20 minutes), the net absolute benefit from alteplase (ie, the difference between those who would do better if given alteplase and those who would do worse) was 55 patients per 1000 treated (95% confidence interval, 13-91; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with intravenous alteplase initiated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset increases the chance of achieving an improved level of function for all patients across the age spectrum, including the over 80s and across all severities of stroke studied (top versus bottom fifth means: 22 versus 4); the earlier that treatment is initiated, the greater the benefit.","output":"Effects of Alteplase for Acute Stroke on the Distribution of Functional Outcomes: A Pooled Analysis of 9 Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ramifications on both an individual level and a public health level.

Six of our patients had nonketotic poorly controlled glycemic status. All patients were mild or asymptomatic as far as COVID-19 clinical symptoms are concerned, but they had high inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), ferritin, and D-dimer, which are commonly seen in a cytokine storm.

Methods This is a pretest-posttest study that evaluated simulated CVC insertion by emergency medicine (EM) faculty physicians. We assessed 44 volunteer participants at a large academic medical center over a 1-month period using a published 29-item checklist. Our primary outcome was the difference in assessment score before and after a SBML intervention. A secondary analysis evaluated predictors of pretest performance. Results A total of 44 subjects participated. Only four of 44 (9.1%) of subjects met a predefined minimum passing score on pretest. Mean assessment scores increased by 21.5% following the SBML intervention (95% confidence interval [CI] of the difference = 18.1% to 24.8%, p < 0.001).

The Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine may provide non-specific protection against respiratory infections through enhancement of trained immunity. We investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on HCW absenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients in nine Dutch hospitals were randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, and followed for one year using a mobile phone application. The primary endpoint was the self-reported number of days of unplanned absenteeism for any reason. Secondary endpoints included documented COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms or fever. This was an investigator-funded study, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03987919). RESULTS: In March/April 2020, 1511 HCWs were enrolled.

The phosphorylation levels of JNK and Smad2L were detected using Western blot. The effect of low-dose paclitaxel on the transforming growth factor beta 1-induced inhibition of type I collagen and connective tissue growth factor expression and JNK and Smad2L phosphorylation was also observed.

Thematic analysis identified themes and subthemes informing about the level of preparedness, response measures, processes, and factors that were either facilitators or those that triggered challenges. SETTING: ICU in a quaternary referral centre affiliated to a university teaching COVID-19-designated pandemic hospital, in Adelaide, South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included eight ICU doctors and eight ICU nurses for the IDIs. Another 16 clinicians participated in FGDs. RESULTS: The study identified six themes relevant to preparedness for, and responses to, COVID-19. The themes included: (1) staff competence and planning, (2) information transfer and communication, (3) education and skills for the safe use of personal protective equipment, (4) team dynamics and clinical practice, (5) leadership, and (6) managing end-of-life situations and expectations of caregivers. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight that preparedness and response to the COVID-19 crisis were proportionate to the situations gravity. More enablers than barriers were identified. However, opportunities for improvement were recognised in the domains of planning, logistics, self-sufficiency with equipment, operational and strategic oversight, communication and managing end-of-life care.","output":"Preparedness and response to COVID-19 in a quaternary intensive care unit in Australia: perspectives and insights from frontline critical care clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over time, new types of crises and disasters have emerged.

This study aimed to screen the antimicrobial potential of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of thirteen (13) samples (Bark, leaf, seed) of eight (8) plants from Cameroon against 3 reference pathogens and to evaluate their synergy with conventional antibiotics against eleven (11) multiresistant uropathogenic (MRU) bacteria. Method Bioactive compounds were extracted from leaves of Leucanthemum vulgare, Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chlorantha Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) using distilled water and ethanol as solvents. The extracts were tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Candida albicans 10231 using the well diffusion method and the microdilution method. The synergistic effect was assessed (using disc diffusion method and the checkerboard method) against MRU bacteria namely Achromobacter xylosoxidans 4892, Citrobacter freundii 426, Enterococcus avium 1669, Escherichia coli 1449, Klebsiella oxytoca 3003, Kocuria rizophilia. 1542, Moraxella catarrhalis 4222, Morganella morganii 1543, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3057, Staphylococcus aureus 1449 and Streptococcus agalactiae 3984. Results We found that distilled water extracted a more important mass of phytochemical compounds (7.9-21.2%) compared to ethanol (5.8-12.4%). Except C. officinalis and G. lucida leaves, the rest of extracts were active with inhibition diameters (ID) ranging from 5 to 36 mm. Both ethanolic (EE) and aqueous extract (AE) of E. chloranta bark (ECB) were the most active against all pathogens with the mean ID of 17 and 36 mm vs S. aureus ATCC 6538, 23 and 14 mm vs E. coli ATCC 25922 and 36 and 19 mm vs C. albicans ATCC 10231. Only the EE of E. chloranta bark (ECB) had a strong activity against all the microorganisms tested (MIC <2 mg / ml); L. vulgare leaves (LVL) and G. lucida seed (GLS) had moderate (average MIC of 8 mg/ml) while all other extracts showed very weak antimicrobial activity. In addition, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) ranged from 0.125 to 0.750. No antagonism (FIC> 4) or indifference (1 FIC4) was noted between the extracts and the antibiotics, but the best synergies were found with ECB which well-modulated Kanamycin (FIC = 0.125 against S. aureus and 0.250 against E. coli), nitrofurantoin (FIC = 0.250 against S. aureus and 0.188 against E. coli) and ampicillin (FIC = 0.125 against E. coli). Similarly, compared to other extracts, ECB, LVL and GLS also well-modulated ampicillin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim against all the above-mentioned resistant uropathogenic bacteria with important increase in fold area (IFA). Conclusion This study show that E. chlorantha bark, L. vulgare leaves G. lucida seed, have good antimicrobial activity against both bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative) and fungi (C. albicans); and should be more investigated for their possible use to the fight against MDR and MRU microorganisms.","output":"Screening of antimicrobial activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of some medicinal plants from Cameroon and assessment of their synergy with common antibiotics against multidrug-resistant uropathogenic bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is an essential regulator of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and functions by directly interacting with the Raf-1 kinase. The abnormal expression of RKIP is linked with numerous diseases including cancers, Alzheimers and diabetic nephropathy. Interestingly, RKIP also plays an indispensable role as a tumor suppressor, thus making it an attractive therapeutic target. To date, only a few small molecules have been reported to modulate the activity of RKIP, and there is a need to explore additional scaffolds. In order to achieve this objective, a pharmacophore model was generated that explores the features of locostatin, the most potent RKIP modulator. Correspondingly, the developed model was subjected to screening, and the mapped compounds from Marine Natural Products (MNP) library were retrieved. The mapped MNPs after ensuing drug-likeness filtration were escalated for molecular docking, where locostatin was regarded as a reference. The MNPs exhibiting higher docking scores than locostatin were considered for molecular dynamics simulations, and their binding affinity towards RKIP was computed via MM/PBSA. A total of five molecules revealed significantly better binding free energy scores than compared to locostatin and, therefore, were reckoned as hits. The hits from the present in silico investigation could act as potent RKIP modulators and disrupt interactions of RKIP with its binding proteins. Furthermore, the identification of potent modulators from marine natural habitat can act as a future drug-discovery source.","output":"Investigation of Marine-Derived Natural Products as Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP)-Binding Ligands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has an unimaginable impact on the global health workforce.

To compare the prognostic value of 3 severity scales: the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score, and the Severity Community-Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) score. To build a new predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients over the age of 75 years admitted with pneumonia due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. Retrospective study of patients older than 75 years admitted from the emergency department for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 12 and April 27, 2020. We recorded demographic (age, sex, living in a care facility or not), clinical (symptoms, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), and analytical (serum biochemistry, blood gases, blood count, and coagulation factors) variables. A risk model was constructed, and the ability of the 3 scales to predict all-cause in-hospital mortality was compared. Results. We included 186 patients with a median age of 85 years (interquartile range, 80-89 years);44.1% were men. Mortality was 47.3%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were as follows for each tool: PSI, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82);CURB-65 score, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.79);and SCAP score, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81). Risk factors included in the model were the presence or absence of symptoms (cough, dyspnea), the CCI, and analytical findings (aspartate aminotransferase, potassium, urea, and lactate dehydrogenase. The AUC for the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88). Conclusions. This study shows that the predictive power of the PSI for mortality is moderate and perceptibly higher than the CURB-65 and SCAP scores. We propose a new predictive model for mortality that offers significantly better performance than any of the 3 scales compared.

Suicide rates in South Korea are among the highest in the world. This paper is the first systematic review investigating socioeconomic risk factors for suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, attempted suicides, and completed suicides) in South Korea. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in Medline and Web of Science. Empirical studies and peer-reviewed articles on the association between individual socioeconomic factors and suicidal behaviors have been included. A total of 53 studies were included in a descriptive synthesis. RESULTS: Overall, 35 studies focused on the association between individual socioeconomic factors and suicidal ideation, 16 were related to suicide attempts, while 10 addressed completed suicides. Low income, unemployment, and financial difficulties were identified as risk factors for all suicidal behaviors. Working in precarious conditions, long working hours, self-employment, changes in employment status, shift work/night-time work, and occupational stress were associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation. Low educational attainment appears to increase the risk for suicide attempts and completed suicide, but the significance of educational attainment on the reporting of suicidal ideation could not be verified. The primary studies were unable to ascertain whether the place of residence impacts on suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the relevance of socioeconomic factors for suicidal behaviors in South Korea. Governmental social spending must be increased and redirected more efficiently so that the economically most vulnerable groups are financially protected and income inequality does not widen. Furthermore, comprehensive prevention strategies at the community level are needed. Future research needs to focus on identifying vulnerable groups for whom the effects of low socioeconomic status may have particularly serious consequences with regard to suicidal behaviors.

This review evaluates the highest risk factors for these patients, not limited to pre-existing hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, hypercoagulation, ischemic heart disease, and a history of underlying heart conditions. SARS-CoV-2 may also precipitate de novo cardiac complications. The interplay between existing cardiac conditions and de novo cardiac complications is the focus of this review. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 patients present with hypercoagulation conditions, cardiac arrhythmias, as significant complications. Also, cardiac arrhythmias are another well-known cardiovascular-related complication seen in COVID-19 infections and merit discussion in this review. Amid the pandemic, myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported to a high degree in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Currently, the specific causative mechanism of the increased incidence of MI is unclear. However, studies suggest several links to high angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in myocardial and endothelial cells, systemic hyper-inflammation, an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, and loss of ACE2-mediated cardio-protection. Furthermore, hypertension and SARS-CoV-2 infection patients prognosis has shown mixed results across current studies. For this reason, an in-depth analysis of the interactions between SARS-CoV2 and the ACE2 cardio-protective mechanism is warranted. Similarly, ACE2 receptors are also expressed in the cerebral cortex tissue, both in neurons and glia. Therefore, it seems very possible for both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems to be damaged leading to further dysregulation and increased risk of mortality risk. This review aims to discuss the current literature related to potential complications of COVID-19 infection with hypertension and the vasculature, including the cervical one. Finally, age is a significant prognostic indicator among COVID-19 patients. For a mean age group of 70 years, the main presenting symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, and a persistent cough. Elderly patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, particularly hypertension and diabetes, represent a significant group of critical cases with increased case fatality rates. With the current understanding of COVID-19, it is essential to explore the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 operates to improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from underlying cardiovascular diseases and reduce the risk of such conditions de novo.","output":"Sequelae and Comorbidities of COVID-19 Manifestations on the Cardiac and the Vascular Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3-D printing is an emerging disruptive technology to disrupt existing manufacturing systems This technology has tremendous potential to improve the quality and complexity of engineering products and also to raise the standard of life Many big corporations and agencies are working to leverage this disruptive technology This technology has not become as popular as the internet of things, etc 3-D printing can help in sustainable operations via cost optimization, lead time reduction, safety incorporation, and better functionalities in the final products The supply chain management of 3-D printed products is a must on digital platforms for the effective delivery of products and services of this evolving technology No concrete study could be found that linked the supply chain management with the critical success factors of the 3-D printing industry Hence this study was undertaken to understand the technical, economic, and managerial aspects that are critical for smooth operations of supply chains of 3-D printed products This study is based on the literature review that includes various relevant articles available in the public domain regarding the supply chain of 3-D printed goods, 3-D printing industry reports, and research papers on Additive Manufacturing technology The study concluded with the critical success factors for a customer-oriented supply chain of 3-D printed parts Further research through case studies is required to study the bottlenecks and potential of improvements in the AM industry in some developed countries where 3-D printing manufacturers are in good numbers","output":"Critical success factors for new horizons in the supply chain of 3-D printed products C A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Concomitant seasonal influenza vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine booster could help to minimise potential disruption to the seasonal influenza vaccination campaign and maximise protection against both diseases among individuals at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation.

METHODS: Blood donors referred to the first lockdown area in Lombardy Region and the neighbouring area were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific antibodies during the period 18 March to 24 June 2020. Serum samples were analysed using both a chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and a neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) assay. RESULTS: In the period from 18 March to 24 June, 1922 blood donors were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 blood donors were tested in parallel with a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification was correlated with NT-Abs titres. In 78.2% of participants the NT-Abs titre was maintained, but in 15.8% it decreased by one four-fold dilution and in 6.0% it increased by one four-fold dilution. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of immunity of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the course of the pandemic and for this reason the monitoring of NT Abs is important.

An online retrospective survey was answered by 352 participants, identifying self-reported injury prevalence, injury management practices and attitudes towards workplace injury reporting. Chi Squared tests for independence were undertaken. A total of 310 (88.1%) staff reported injuries; risk factors for injury type included self-perceived job security, working hours, and perceived job control. Physical limitations, loss of confidence, workplace changes, and lifestyle implications were reported as consequences of injury. A total of 75.3% (n = 134) of staff were likely to seek time-off following fractures, but only 48.6% (n = 86) would take time-off for concussion. Attitudes towards injury management were influenced by financial circumstances, perceived staff shortages, previous injury experiences, and perceived employer expectations. The high self-reported injury prevalence could result in decreased workforce efficiency, poor physical health, and negative implications on retention and career longevity.

The research questions concerned how the SVAI was delivered, the content of the SVAI and the physiotherapists experiences from delivering the SVAI. Methods We used qualitative and quantitative data from 148 intervention logs documenting the follow-up provided to each participant, recordings of 18 intervention sessions and minutes from 20 meetings with the physiotherapists. The log data were analysed with descriptive statistics. A qualitative content analysis was performed of the recordings, and we identified facilitators and barriers for implementation from the minutes. Results Of 170 participants randomised to the SVAI 152 (89%) received the intervention and 148 logs were completed. According to the logs, 131 participants received the correct number of sessions (all by telephone) and 146 action plans were developed. The physiotherapists did not attend any workplace meetings but contacted stakeholders in 37 cases. The main themes from the recorded sessions were: symptom burden, managing symptoms, relations with the workplace and fear of not being able to manage work. The physiotherapists felt they were able to build rapport with most participants. However, case management was hindered by the restricted number of sessions permitted according to the protocol.

The market for counterfeit drugs used in sexual medicine, most notably type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5i), is rapidly growing. AIMS: To report the health risks associated with the use of counterfeit medications, the reasons driving their use, and the strategies enacted to contain this phenomenon. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of the literature regarding counterfeit PDE5i was carried between January and June 2021, then updated in August 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We primarily aimed to clarify the main drivers for counterfeit PDE5i use, the health risks associated, and the currently available strategies to fight counterfeiters. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one records were considered for the present scoping review. Production of fake PDE5i is highly lucrative and the lacking awareness of the potential health risks makes it a largely exploitable market by counterfeiters. Adulteration with other drugs, microbial contamination and unreliable dosages make counterfeit medications a cause of worry also outside of the sexual medicine scope. Several laboratory techniques have been devised to identify and quantify the presence of other compounds in counterfeit medications. Strategies aimed at improving awareness, providing antitampering packaging and producing non-falsifiable products, such as the orodispersible formulations, are also described. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Improving our understanding of the PDE5i counterfeit phenomenon can be helpful to promote awareness of this issue and to improve patient care. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Despite the systematic approach, few clinical studies were retrieved, and data concerning the prevalence of counterfeit PDE5i use is not available on a global scale. CONCLUSION: The counterfeit phenomenon is a steadily growing issue, with PDE5i being the most counterfeited medication with potentially large harmful effects on unaware consumers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A comparative analysis of the treatment of 72 patients with allergic rhinitis, divided into groups: I (main, n=21), which included immunocompromised patients who received sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollin and inhaled immunotherapy with cycloferon (every other day, a course of 10 procedures, the total dose of Cycloferon per course is 1250 mg); II (comparison, n=22) - immunocompromised patients who received monotherapy with antipollinum and III (control, n=29) - patients with allergic rhinitis without signs of immunocompromise, who also received antipollinum. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the quality of life (RQLQ questionnaire), the severity of nasal symptoms (the patient's self-observation diary) and the need for drugs after a course of intranasal immunotherapy. RESULTS The inclusion of cycloferon in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis increased its effectiveness - the severity of nasal symptoms decreased: in terms of sneezing, a decrease of 53.5 times versus 1.82 - in the control, ?nasal congestion? - 6.3 times versus 2.6 - in the control, ?itching in the nose? - 4.9 and 4.2 times, respectively (p<0.05).

We examined the independent association between d-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured d-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary exposure was the highest normalized d-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2, 2-3.9, 4-7.9, and &#8805; 8 the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 yr [interquartile range, 52-71 yr]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a d-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal.

Eight databases (one Chinese), four clinical trial registries (one Chinese) and two pre-print servers were then searched with no language or date restrictions. Post-protocol/pre-data extraction, the inclusion criteria was restricted to adults. Meta-analysis used weighted, random-effects models. Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool and GRADE were used to appraise evidence certainty. Searches for COVID-19 evidence are updated 6-monthly. Results: As of Oct-2020, 1,907 articles and protocols were screened, and 28 RCTs involving 5,403 participants (none with SARS-CoV-2 infections) were included. Compared to placebo, oral or intranasal zinc prevented 5 RTIs/100 person-months (95%CI: 1-9, NTT=20) in adults without zinc deficiency (moderate-certainty), but not pre/post exposure prevention following human rhinovirus inoculation (RR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.77-1.21, moderate-certainty). There was low-certainty evidence of clinically important RTI treatment outcomes. Compared to placebo, sublingual or intranasal zinc improved day-3 symptom severity (MD 1.2 points lower, 95%CI: 0.7-1.7) and reduced symptom duration (MD 2 days shorter, 95%CI: 0.2-3.5;HR 0.55 over 7-days, 95% CI: 0.32-0.91, NNT=5).

Multi-county metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) now accommodate 73% of the U.S. population and, as of 27 September 2020, they were home to 78% of reported cases of COVID-19 and 82% of reported deaths. The rationale for a renewed focus on these spatial units is that they are found to be densely interconnected yet easily identifiable locales for the spread of pandemics and therefore for their proper management as well. The paper uses available data on cases and deaths in U.S. counties as of 27 September 2020 to lend statistical support to four hypotheses: (1) The Onset Hypothesis: The onset of COVID-19 cases and deaths commenced earlier in multi-county metropolitan areas than in small-city counties or rural counties;(2) The Peak Hypothesis: The current peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths occurred earlier in multi-county metropolitan areas;(3) The Scaling Hypothesis: Multi-county metropolitan areas had more than their shares of COVID-19 cases and deaths than their shares in the population;and (4) The Neighbor Hypothesis: Levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths in counties within multi-county metropolitan areas were more strongly related to respective levels in their neighboring counties than small-city counties or rural counties. The reported statistical results demonstrate the value of adopting a metropolitan perspective on pandemics and working to empower effective institutional arrangements at the metropolitan level for managing present and future pandemics.","output":"Why Pandemics, Such as COVID-19, Require a Metropolitan Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 remains a threat to public health, with over 30 million cases in the US alone. As understanding of optimal patient care has improved, treatment guidelines have continued to evolve. This study characterized real-world trends in treatment for US patients hospitalized with COVID-19, stratified by whether patients required invasive ventilation. METHODS: US patients diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 23 and December 31, 2020, in the Optum de-identified COVID-19 electronic health record (EHR) data set were identified. Both drug and procedure codes were used to ascertain medications, and both procedure and diagnostic codes were used to detect invasive ventilation during hospitalization. Medication trends were estimated by computing proportions of hospitalized patients receiving each drug weekly during the study period. RESULTS: In this cohort of 71,366 hospitalized patients, the largest observed change in care was related to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (Figure). HCQ usage peaked at 87% of patients receiving invasive ventilation (54% without ventilation) in the first week of this study (March 23-29), but declined to < 5% of patients, regardless of ventilation status, by the end of May. In contrast, dexamethasone usage was 10% at baseline in patients receiving ventilation (1% without ventilation) and increased to a steady state of >85% of patients receiving ventilation ( >50% without ventilation) by the end of June. Similarly, remdesivir usage increased sharply from a baseline of 2% of patients and continued to rise to a peak of 79% of patients receiving invasive ventilation (44% without ventilation) in November before declining. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Meaningful shifts in treatments for US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were observed from March through December 2020. A dramatic decline was observed for HCQ use, likely owing to safety concerns, while usage of dexamethasone and remdesivir increased as evidence of their efficacy mounted. Across medications, usage was substantially more prevalent among patients requiring invasive ventilation compared with patients with less severe cases. DISCLOSURES: Kelly Zalocusky, PhD, F.

COVID-19 infection is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe, life-threatening manifestations. Personalized medicine can play a key role in elucidating individual susceptibility to the infection as well as inter-individual variability in clinical course, prognosis and response to treatment. Integrating personalized medicine into clinical practice can also transform health care by enabling the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual profiles, improving the detection of outbreaks or defining transmission patterns at an increasingly local level. SARS-CoV2 genome sequencing, together with the assessment of specific patient genetic variants, will support clinical decision-makers and ultimately better ways to fight this disease. Additionally, it would facilitate a better stratification and selection of patients for clinical trials, thus increasing the likelihood of obtaining positive results. Lastly, defining a national strategy to implement in clinical practice all available tools of personalized medicine in COVID-19 could be challenging but linked to a positive transformation of the health care system. In this review, we provide an update of the achievements, promises, and challenges of personalized medicine in the fight against COVID-19 from susceptibility to natural history and response to therapy, as well as from surveillance to control measures and vaccination. We also discuss strategies to facilitate the adoption of this new paradigm for medical and public health measures during and after the pandemic in health care systems.","output":"Implementing Personalized Medicine in COVID-19 in Andalusia: An Opportunity to Transform the Healthcare System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE New treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been developed to improve patient outcomes, raise their quality of life, and reduce joint damage, but long-term responses and remission remain low. This study aimed to analyse the Spanish prescribing patterns and the effectiveness of biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available for RA in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS An observational retrospective study was performed in a teaching hospital, analysing the different combinations of drugs prescribed, real-life effectiveness and reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS In total, 210 patients were included, with 19 different patterns (pharmacological groups alone or in combination) of treatment prescribed. Most patients started their treatment with a conventional synthetic (cs) DMARD alone or in combination with a glucocorticosteroid. Among the initial patterns, treatment with only one csDMARD showed a longer duration. The time to first bDMARD was 6 years. TNF- inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed drugs as initial biological treatments. The highest percentages of good responses and remissions were achieved with tocilizumab, etanercept and infliximab. The time to remission was also lower with tocilizumab. Lack of response, adverse effects and remission were the main causes of bDMARD withdrawal. The duration of treatments until withdrawal was similar among bDMARDs, except for rituximab, for which the duration was slightly shorter. CONCLUSIONS Prescribing pattern analysis showed the highest responses and remission rates with tocilizumab and TNF- inhibitors. The main reasons for withdrawal were lack of response and adverse effects.

Women (n = 19; 28.52  3.74 years; 20.94  4.69 weeks gestation; BMI 29.33  9.08) were randomized into a yoga or a non-yoga control group. There were no differences in demographic factors or depression/anxiety scores between groups at baseline. Baseline levels of anxiety and depression were high, with an average depression score of 8.10  4.85 (scores > 8 represent possible depression) and an average anxiety score of 39.26  12.99 (scores  39 represent a clinically significant anxiety). After just one session of yoga, women reported feeling less depressed (p = 0.028), tense (p < 0.001), and fatigued (p = 0.004). After 10 weeks, the yoga group had lower anxiety (p = 0.002), depression (p = 0.032), and total mood disturbance (p = 0.002) scores when compared to the control group.

STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional community survey. SETTING: Australian general public. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years (N = 4362). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p < 0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59%% vs 72% p < 0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. People with inadequate health literacy were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5; p < 0.001) and reported more difficulty with remembering and accessing medicines since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7; p < 0.001). People with lower health literacy were also more likely to endorse misinformed beliefs about COVID-19 and vaccinations (in general) than those with adequate health literacy. The same pattern of results was observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that there are important disparities in COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours according to people's health literacy and language. These have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. People with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and are also most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.

Mdecins sans Frontires, in collaboration with the South African Department of Health, has been working in Eshowe/Mbongolwane (KwaZulu Natal) since 2011 to increase access to quality HIV services. Five years after an initial survey, we conducted a second survey to measure progress in HIV diagnosis and viral suppression and to identify remaining gaps. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based, stratified two-stage cluster survey was implemented in 2018, using the same design as in 2013. Consenting participants aged 15C59 years were interviewed and tested for HIV at home. Those HIV-positive were tested for HIV viral load (viral suppression defined as <1000 copies/mL). RESULTS: Overall, 3,278 individuals were included. The proportion of HIV-positive participants virally suppressed was 83.8% in 2018 compared to 57.1% in 2013 (p<0.001), with increases in all subpopulations. The largest gap remained in men aged 15C29 years, among whom viral suppression was 51.5%. Nevertheless, of the total unsuppressed participants, 60.3% were women, and 57.4% were individuals aged 30C59 years. Between 2013 and 2018, HIV-positive status awareness progressed from 75.2% to 89.9% and ART coverage among those aware from 70.4% to 93.8%, respectively. Among those on ART, 94.5% were virally suppressed in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Viral suppression improved significantly from 2013 to 2018, in all age and gender groups of PLHIV. However, almost half of HIV-positive young men remained unsuppressed, while the majority of virally unsuppressed PLHIV were women and older adults. To continue lowering HIV transmission, specific strategies are needed to increase viral suppression in those groups.","output":"Increase in HIV viral suppression in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Community-based cross sectional surveys 2018 and 2013.

The trajectories of COVID-19 hospitalizations during this period are expected to differ across communities depending on their age distributions, vaccination coverage, cumulative incidence, and adoption of risk mitigating behaviors. Yet, existing predictive models of COVID-19 hospitalizations are almost exclusively focused on national- and state-level predictions.

They performed three walking tests: normal walking, fast walking, and visually impaired walking. Three-dimensional acceleration data for gait were obtained using the smartphone app Pocket Gait. This study used multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to explore the effects of the walking state, self-reported daily walking amount, and age on the step frequency, root mean square (RMS) acceleration, step time variability, regularity, and symmetry. RESULTS: The walking state, self-reported daily walking amount, and age had statistically significant effects on gait quality.

With no vaccine or drug being currently available to control the pandemic spread, prevention and PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) testing becomes a crucial pillar of medical systems. Aim of the present study was to report on the first results of the measures taken in a large German Department of Radiation Oncology, including PCR testing of asymptomatic cancer patients. Methods Pandemic-adapted hygiene regulations and prevention measures for patients and staff were implemented. A visiting ban on both wards was implemented from the beginning and medical staff and patients were required to wear face masks at all times. The waiting rooms were rearranged to ensure distance between patients of at least 1.5 meters. Clinical follow up was mainly done by telephone and all patients had to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms and contacts with COVID-19 patients before entering our department. Educational documents were created for patients to raise awareness of symptoms and avoidance strategies for interactions with other people. Indications for therapy and fractionation schemes were adapted when possible. In a subsequent step, all new asymptomatic patients were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at our screening station shortly before their simulation CT. Results All these measures and implementations have been well accepted. Regarding the PCR testing, only 1 out of 139 asymptomatic patients of our cohort so far tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, reflecting a prevalence of 0.72% in this cancer patient population. Up to this point no staff members was tested positive. The start of the treatment for the PCR-positive patient was deferred for two weeks. Conclusion Due to the pandemic-adapted implementations, our department seems well prepared during this crisis. The initial screening helps to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in order to protect other patients and our staff from infection and the observed PCR prevalence is in line with comparable studies.

The demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory and treatment data of all cases were analysed. Results Of the 107 dead patients with COVID-19, 71 (66.4%) were male and 36 (33.6%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 71.2  12.1 years. 82 (76.6%) of patients had chronic diseases. The mean duration from admission to death was 9 (IQR,5-14) days. Respiratory functional damage was the most common one followed by heart and kidney. Hematuria was found in 36(33.6%) patients. 89(83.2%) patients albumin levels were decreased. 68(63.6%) patients had anemia. concerning laboratory results, 55 (69.6%) and 56 (70.1%) patients have the elevated white blood cells and elevated Neutrophils during the process;only 43 (54.4%) have the decreased Lymphocytes;The values of platelets and haemoglobin decreased in 64(81.0%) and 58 (73.4%) patients. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevated in near half of patients, while almost 80% of patients have the decreased albumin. The elevated blood urea nitrogen and cystatin C were manifested in about 70% of patients. Procalcitonin was elevated in 38 (71.7%) patients. Conclusions In conclusion, the older men with chronic diseases are more likely to die from COVID-19. Apart from that, more attention should be pay on timely treatment, coinfections, malnutrition, and dysfunction of kidney and coagulation. The rising values (white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, PCT and PT) and the decreased values (PLT, Hb and albumin) maybe meaningful for predict the poor prognosis.","output":"A multi-centered, retrospective, descriptive study on 107 dead patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) disease (COVID-19) is a novel threat that hampers life expectancy especially in obese individuals.

METHODS: We extracted the incidence and mortality data of eight notifiable infectious zoonotic diseases from the website of the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China for the period of January 2015 to April 2021. RESULTS: First, the overall incidence of zoonotic diseases decreased from 0.3714 per 100 000 in 2015C2019 to 0.2756 in 2020 (25.79% reduction, p<0.001); however, a dramatic increase in activity was seen in 2021 compared with 2020 (0.4478 per 100 000 in 2021, 62.47% increase, p<0.001). Anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and hydatid disease exhibited significant upward trends in 2021. Second, analysed further by stages, the monthly incidence in the routine stage (from May to December 2020) was much higher than that in the emergency stage of the COVID-19 (from January to April 2020) (55.33% increase, p<0.001). We also found that the monthly observed incidence was significantly lower than the predicted incidence of a 10.29% reduction in the emergency stage.

OBJECTIVE. Although chest CT is the standard imaging modality in early diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the use of lung ultrasound (US) presents some advantages over the use of chest CT and may play a complementary role in the workup of COVID-19. The objective of our study was to investigate US findings in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship of the US findings with the duration of symptoms and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From March 3, 2020, to March 30, 2020, consecutive patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test result for the virus that causes COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Lung US was performed, and the imaging features were analyzed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the percentages of patients with each US finding between groups with different symptom durations and disease severity. RESULTS. Our study population comprised 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age  SD, 59.8  18.3 years; age range, 21-92 years). All 28 patients (100.0%, 28/28) had positive lung US findings. The most common findings were the following: B-lines (100.0%, 28/28), consolidation (67.9%, 19/28), and a thickened pleural line (60.7%, 17/28). A thickened pleural line was observed in a higher percentage of patients with a longer duration of the disease than in those with a shorter duration of the disease, and pulmonary consolidations were more common in severe and critical cases than in moderate cases. CONCLUSION. Typical lung US findings in patients with COVID-19 included B-lines, pulmonary consolidation, and a thickened pleural line.

METHODS: The in vitro study elucidated inhibitory effects of astragalin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside from leaves of persimmon and green tea seeds, on oxidative stress-induced airway fibrosis. The in vivo study explored the demoting effects of astragalin on epithelial to mesenchymal transition in BALB/c mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). RESULTS: The exposure of 20 M H(2)O(2) for 72 h accelerated E-cadherin loss and vimentin induction in airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells, which was reversed by non-toxic astragalin at 1C20 M. Astragalin allayed the airway tissue levels of ROS and vimentin enhanced by OVA challenge. Collagen type 1 production increased in H(2)O(2)Cexposed epithelial cells and collagen fiber deposition was observed in OVA-challenged mouse airways. This study further investigated that the oxidative stress-triggered autophagic regulation was responsible for inducing airway fibrosis. H(2)O(2) highly enhanced the expression induction of the autophagy-related beclin-1 and light chains 3A/B (LC3A/B) within 4 h and astragalin blocked such induction by H(2)O(2). This compound deterred the ROS-promoted autophagosome formation in BEAS-2B cells. Consistently, in OVA-sensitized mice the expression of beclin-1 and LC3A/B was highly induced, and oral administration of astragalin suppressed the autophagosome formation with inhibiting the induction of these proteins in OVA-challenged airway subepithelium. Induction of autophagy by spermidine influenced the epithelial induction of E-cadherin and vimentin that was blocked by treating astragalin.

Methods The study was carried out with two cohorts: 1) patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and 2) healthcare workers from the same dialysis center as controls, each group with 72 subjects. Participants received a dose of Covishield ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine. The humoral immunological response was determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay which quantitatively measures antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. Results All study subjects in the control group developed a humoral response (antibody titer of 0.8 U/mL), while only 64 of 72 in the dialysis group (88.9%) were responders. Age ( = -0.234, p = 0.04) and sodium level ( = 0.237, p = 0.04) correlated with low antibody titer in bivariate analysis.

In addition, we implemented both univariate and multivariate meta-regressions to isolate the moderators of JOL effects and memory effects. The results revealed a small-to-moderate effect of font size on JOLs. There was also a small but significant effect of font size on memory. This suggests that JOLs and memory accuracy both increase with font size, rather than being completely dissociated. Moreover, JOL-memory dissociation only occurred when font size ranged between very small and intermediate.

The requirement of well-trained personnel and sophisticated instrument of current primary mean (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) may hinder the practical application worldwide. In this regard, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a colorimetric assay is proposed for the SARS-CoV-2 detection. The methodology we have described herein utilizes DNA-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a universal colorimetric readout and can specifically target ORF1ab and N regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. After the virus genome is amplified through RT-RPA, the resulting abundant dsDNA will bind and activate Cas12a. Under trans-cleavage degradation, the capped DNA substrate will be hydrolyzed gradually from AuNPs, demonstrating a change in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which can be facially monitored by UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy and naked eye observation. The high amplification efficiency from RT-RPA and Cas12a trans-cleavage process bring the sensitivity of our method to 1 copy of viral genome sequence per test. Notably, under the dual variations inspecting from the isothermal amplification and Cas12a activation process, the false positive events from other beta coronavirus members can be effectively avoided and thus significantly improve the specificity. Furthermore, the reliability of this colorimetric assay is validated by standard clinical samples from the hospital laboratory department. Through integration of the inherently high sensitivity and specificity from an RPA-coupled Cas12a system with the intrinsic simplicity of AuNP-based colorimetric assay, our method increases the practical testing availability of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a for Facile and Highly Sensitive Colorimetric SARS-CoV-2 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current article presents an emotion regulation model of clinical reinforcement sensitivity wherein reinforcement sensitivity predicts depression and anxiety via trait preferences for concomitant emotion regulation strategies.

Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD.

However, almost 8 months following the initiation of the European vaccination programme, the need for prospective monitoring of the vaccine-induced immune response, its determinants and related side-effects remains a priority. The present study aimed to quantify the immune response following full vaccination with the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine by measuring the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in healthcare professionals. Moreover, common side-effects and factors associated with IgG titers were identified. For this purpose, blood samples from 517 individuals were obtained and analysed. Blood sampling was performed at a mean period of 69.023.5 days following the second dose of the vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers had an overall mean value of 4.232.76. Females had higher titers than males (4.442.70 and 3.89 2.84, respectively; P=0.007), while non-smokers had higher titers than smokers (4.482.79 and 3.802.64, respectively; P=0.003). An older age was also associated with lower antibody titers (P<0.001). Moreover, the six most prevalent adverse effects were pain at the injection site (72.1%), generalized fatigue (40.5%), malaise (36.3%), myalgia (31,0%), headache (25.8%) and dizziness/weakness (21.6%). The present study demonstrated that the immune response after receiving the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is dependent on various modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Overall, the findings of the present study highlight two key aspects of the vaccination programs: First, the need for prospective immunosurveillance studies in order to estimate the duration of immunity, and second, the need to identify those individuals who are at a greater risk of developing low IgG titers in order to evaluate the need for a third dose of the vaccine.","output":"Immune response (IgG) following full inoculation with BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA among healthcare professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the crude mortality rate could reach 49% in critical patients.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.

SoMe is ubiquitous in medical education, with roles across undergraduate programmes, including professionalism, blended learning, well-being and mentoring. Previous systematic reviews took place before recent explosions in SoMe popularity and revealed a paucity of high-quality empirical studies assessing its effectiveness in medical education. This review aimed to synthesise evidence regarding SoMe interventions in undergraduate medical education, to identify features associated with positive and negative outcomes. METHODS Authors searched 31 key terms through seven databases, in addition to references, citation and hand searching, between 16th June and 16th July 2020. Studies describing SoMe interventions and research on exposure to existing SoMe were included. Title, abstract and full paper screening were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Included papers were assessed for methodological quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and/or the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) instrument. Extracted data were synthesised using narrative synthesis. RESULTS 112 studies from 26 countries met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included studies had not significantly improved since 2013. Engagement and satisfaction with SoMe platforms in medical education are described. Students felt SoMe flattened hierarchies and improved communication with educators. SoMe use was associated with improvement in objective knowledge assessment scores and self-reported clinical and professional performance, however evidence for long term knowledge retention was limited. SoMe use was occasionally linked to adverse impacts upon mental and physical health. Professionalism was heavily investigated and considered important, though generally negative correlations between SoMe use and medical professionalism may exist. CONCLUSIONS Social media is enjoyable for students, may improve short term knowledge retention and can aid communication between learners and educators. However, higher-quality study is required to identify longer-term impact upon knowledge and skills, provide clarification on professionalism standards and protect against harms.","output":"Social media in undergraduate medical education: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a more severe strain of coronavirus (CoV) that was first emerged in China in 2019.

Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. Methods We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Results Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period. Conclusions Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R0.

METHODS The conceptual framework of HIT-6 was evaluated using baseline data from the PROMISE-2 study (NCT02974153; N = 1072). A unidimensional graded response model within the item response theory (IRT) framework was used to evaluate model fit and item characteristics. Using baseline and week 12 data, convergent and discriminant validity of the HIT-6 was evaluated by correlation coefficients. Sensitivity to change was assessed by evaluating correlations between HIT-6 scores and change scores for other established reference measures. All examined correlations were specified a priori with respect to direction and magnitude. Known-groups analyses were anchored using Patient Global Impression of Change and monthly headache days at week 12. RESULTS A unidimensional model fit the data well, supporting that the 6 items measure a single construct. All item slopes and thresholds were within acceptable ranges. In both the validity and sensitivity to change analyses, all observed correlations conformed to directional expectations, and most conformed to magnitude expectations. Known-groups analyses demonstrated that the HIT-6 total score can distinguish between clinically meaningful CM subgroups.

Phone follow-up batteries were performed at 6- and 12-months post-COVID symptom onset. The primary 12-month outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications using multivariable ordinal analysis. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA) and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep. Changes in outcome scores from 6 to 12-months were compared using non-parametric paired-samples sign test. RESULTS: Twelve-month follow-up was completed in N=242 patients (median age 65, 64% male, 34% intubated during hospitalization) and N=174 completed both 6- and 12-month follow-up. At 12-months 197/227 (87%) had 1 abnormal metric: mRS>0 (75%), Barthel<100 (64%), t-MoCA18 (50%), high anxiety (7%), depression (4%), fatigue (9%) and poor sleep (10%). 12-month mRS scores did not differ significantly among those with (N=113) or without (N=129) neurological complications during hospitalization after adjusting for age, sex, race, pre-COVID mRS and intubation status (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI0.8-2.5), though those with neurological complications had higher fatigue scores (T-score 47 vs 44, P=0.037). Significant improvements in outcome trajectories from 6- to 12-months were observed in t-MoCA scores (56% improved, median difference 1 point, P=0.002), and Neuro-QoL anxiety scores (45% improved, P=0.003).

D-dimer may help evaluate disease severity and predict outcomes at hospital admission. However, its non-specificity and long analysis times strongly constrain its clinical value. Viscoelastic tests (VET) are widely available rapid point-of-care devices that have been shown to detect a hypercoagulable state (increased clot stiffness and fibrinolysis shutdown) as major contributors of the thrombotic complication in COVID-19. Nevertheless, based on the data obtained so far, definitive conclusions have not been drawn. ObjectivesWe aim to evaluate the association between VET parameters, standard coagulation tests and inflammation markers assessed in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission with disease severity and outcomes. Patients/MethodsA total of 69 COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization were included in the study. The pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state was analyzed by a panel of inflammation markers (IL-6, CRP, LDH, ferritin), routine coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a SEER sonorheometry VET profile (Quantra(R) System). ResultsInflammatory markers IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin were elevated in a high percentage of patients (73.6%, 89.2%, 57.1% and 52.4%), as were coagulation-related parameters such as fibrinogen (81.4%) and D-dimer levels (66.2%). Quantra(R) analysis revealed increased clot stiffness (CS) in 34.8%, particularly due to increased fibrinogen contribution (FCS) in 63.7%. Increased clot stability to lysis (CSL) was observed in 32.4%. Age > 65 years, elevated values of fibrinogen, D-dimer, LDH, increased clot stiffness and resistance to clot lysis were significantly associated with worsening disease. The Quantra(R) FCS parameter showed a particularly high prognostic value in distinguishing patients with severe symptomatology.

In part, these arose from the fact that after independence Malta, as a small Mediterranean island-country, had to take full control of its own destiny, including its economy and politics. At approximately the same time a band called The Malta Bums was set up and eventually gained popularity both locally and further afield. Their 1967 release of Viva Malta achieved unprecedented success and is still hugely popular today. This article analyses this song in its historical, cultural and social context. It discusses how and why this track became so popular at that time and is still popular nowadays. For that purpose, it scrutinises its music and lyrics, as well as the production process and how each one of these built on the familiar to convey sentiments of national unity central to the loyalty that the lyrics call for.","output":"Viva Malta: national unity, loyalty and the familiar in a post-independence Maltese song"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 1 interferons (IFN) protect the host against viruses by engaging a cognate receptor (consisting of IFNAR1/IFNAR2 chains) and inducing downstream signaling and gene expression. However, inflammatory stimuli can trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation thereby attenuating IFN effects in vitro. The significance of this paradoxical regulation is unknown. Presented here results demonstrate that inability to stimulate IFNAR1 ubiquitination in the Ifnar1(SA) knock-in mice renders them highly susceptible to numerous inflammatory syndromes including acute and chronic pancreatitis, and autoimmune and toxic hepatitis. Ifnar1(SA) mice (or their bone marrow-receiving wild type animals) display persistent immune infiltration of inflamed tissues, extensive damage and gravely inadequate tissue regeneration. Pharmacologic stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination is protective against from toxic hepatitis and fulminant generalized inflammation in wild type but not Ifnar1(SA) mice. These results suggest that endogenous mechanisms that trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination for limiting the inflammation-induced tissue damage can be purposely mimicked for therapeutic benefits.

This temperature-time combination is sufficient for eliminating pathogens in donor milk, but also negatively affects several bioactive milk components. Long heating up times may further affect the bioactive properties of pasteurized milk. High-Temperature-Short-Time (HTST), a treatment with shorter processing times (72C for 15 sec), was investigated as a suitable alternative to HoP. In addition, pasteurization methods that follow the same temperature regime but with varying heating up times were compared. Human milk samples from four different donors were combined into one pool, which was then used to perform all analyses. The effects of these methods on the levels and functionality of immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, lysozyme and bile salt-stimulated lipase, were evaluated with LC-MS/MS-based proteomics and activity assays, while the pasteurization efficacy was evaluated with an alkaline phosphatase test. HoP, a treatment with long processing times, times, caused the highest reduction in all proteins studied (reduced by 50-98%). Compounds such as lactoferrin and bile salt-stimulated lipase that are more sensitive to heat treatments were better retained with HTST, but their levels and functionality were still significantly lower than those of untreated donor milk (52 and 81% reduction of lactoferrin and bile salt-stimulated lipase activity, respectively). Our findings showed that a treatment with considerably shorter processing times, such as HTST, may reduce the thermal damage caused to the bioactive proteins compared to HoP, without affecting pasteurization efficacy. Since the vast majority of the donor human milk banks that are currently operating on a global level apply HoP to donor milk, our findings may provide relevant information for the optimization of donor milk processing.","output":"High-Temperature Short-Time Preserves Human Milk's Bioactive Proteins and Their Function Better Than Pasteurization Techniques With Long Processing Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: Emergency departments (EDs) serve as the front lines for diagnosing and treating patients with a variety of diseases encompassing the entire spectrum of severity. Patients with suspected respiratory tract infections, whether bacterial or viral, present to EDs with a range of unpredictable clinical courses, with a significant number at risk of progressing to critical illness caused by a dysregulated immune response that leads to organ dysfunction (sepsis) and death, as seen in severe COVID-19. In the setting of a pandemic or local outbreak caused by a novel pathogen or in situations where pathogen identification is limited, a pathogen-independent assessment of the host response could assist clinicians in the risk stratification of persons under investigation for infection by providing a patient-centered, objective assessment of the state of immune activity. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of IntelliSep test to stratify such a population for risk of sepsis and poor outcomes. Methods: The IntelliSep test is a novel in vitro diagnostic that quantifies the state of immune activation by measuring the biophysical properties of leukocytes from a routine blood draw sample in under 10 minutes. The test provides a single score, the IntelliSep Index (ISI), between 0.1-10.0 (inclusive), stratified into three discrete interpretation bands of risk for disease severity: Green (0.1C4.9), Yellow (5.0C6.2), and Red (6.3C10.0), developed in prior sepsis-focused studies (ONeal Jr., PLOS ONE, 2021). In a prospective study at a large academic medical center in Baton Rouge, LAA early in the COVID-19 pandemic (April 07 C April 28, 2020) and prior to widespread availability of rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, adult patients presenting to the ED with respiratory symptoms who had a CBC drawn within 4.5 hours of initial vital signs were enrolled. An aliquot from the CBC draw was tested, and patients were followed by retrospective chart review for outcome information. Sepsis disease status was determined by objective evaluation of infection (per modified CDC objective definitions), and organ dysfunction (defined as an increase in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 or more points), and in select cases, physician clinical review. C-reactive protein (CRP) values were collected when ordered per standard care. Results: The 282 patients (34% SARS-CoV-2+) in the final analysis (observed sepsis incidence rate of 30.9%) were stratified by the ISI as 182 (64.5%) Green, 54 (19.1%) Yellow, and 46 (16.3 %) Red. The test achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.85 (0.8 C 0.9, 95% CI). When comparing subjects in Green and Red Bands, negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 90% (78% C 96%, 95% CI) and 80% (68% C 90%, 95% CI), respectively, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 35.3 (22 C 48, 95% CI) was observed. Additionally, in the subpopulation of subjects with CRP ordered (N = 168), when compared to CRP with cutoff  75, the ISI showed superior negative predictive value (97.9% vs. 95.4%) in predicting all-cause 7-day mortality and positive predictive value is predicting the need for hospital stay of  2 days (94.4% vs. 87.3%). Conclusion: The ISI, a quantitative measure of immune activation, may offer a pathogen-independent means for rapid diagnosis and risk stratification for sepsis amongst ED patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, with the potential to aid physicians in improving outcomes and efficiency of care.","output":"83 Assessment of a Cellular Host Response Test as a Sepsis Diagnostic for Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department Suspected of Respiratory Infections in the Setting of a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research aimed to conduct a generalized analysis of clinical information of diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in children of different ages The study involved 699 pediatric patients with coronavirus disease COVID-19 divided into four clinical groups - 67 infants under 2 months of age (group I), 320 children at the age from 60 days to 6 years (group II), 127 children of junior and middle school age (group III) and 155 patients at the age over 12 (group IV) A complex examination of patients included the study of the clinical, laboratory and instrumental markers, as well as analysis of the extent and duration of therapy It was found, that coronavirus infection COVID-19 was characterized in children of different ages by lesions of the upper respiratory tract (70 1%), lower respiratory tract (54 7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (9 2%), neurological changes (17 8%) Affliction of the lung parenchyma with an appropriate clinical-radiological manifestation as a sign of COVID-19 was determined with occurrence from 23 9% to 25 9% of children with a reliable increase of chances to develop pneumonia (OR=7 5) at the juvenile age The most frequent changes in additional methods were leukocytosis (18 8% of cases), thrombocytosis (14 5% of people), leukopenia (11 1% of people) and increase of C-reactive protein in 43 7% of children Elevated content of platelets was mainly found in group I (38 3% of cases), and it increases significantly during the period of inpatient treatment, which coincides with the tendencies to increasing occurrence of C-reactive protein content in this age cohort (OR=5 0)","output":"Peculiarities of the course of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in children of various ages in certain regions of Ukraine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There have been significant spatio-temporal variations in how the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded in different parts of the country.

Hypobaric hypoxia altered redox homeostasis and impaired calcium ion handling in skeletal muscles. Dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis and activated calpain is the prime stressor in high altitude hypoxia while the reason for subsequent abnormal release of pathological Ca2+ into cytoplasm is largely unexplored. The present study identified the redox remodeling in the Ca2+ release channel, Ryanodine Receptor (RyR1) owing to its hypernitrosylation state in skeletal muscles in chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats. RyR1-hypernitrosylation decreases the binding of FKBP12/calstabin-1 and other complexes from the channel, causing \\"leakiness\\" in RyR1 ion-channel. A strong RyR1 stabilizer, S107 enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 with hypernitrosylated RyR1, reduced Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and improved muscle strength and function under chronic hypoxia. Administration of S107 inhibited the skeletal muscle damage, maintained ultrastructure of sarcomere and sarcolemmal integrity. Histological analysis proved the increase in cross-sectional area of myofibers. Further, the number of apoptotic cells was also reduced by S107 treatment. Conclusively, we proposed that the redox remodeling of RyR1 (hypernitrosylated-RyR1) might be responsible for dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis which consequently impaired muscle strength and function in response to chronic hypoxic stress. Reduced SR Ca2+ leak and enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 may provide a novel therapeutic avenue in ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy at high altitude.","output":"Redox modification of ryanodine receptor contributes to impaired Ca2+ homeostasis and exacerbates muscle atrophy under high altitude."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted COVID-19 patients in a Danish hospital setting where an early active government intervention was taken.

PURPOSE: Several research articles have been published within the last decade comparing the use of tenecteplase to alteplase in ischemic stroke management. Prior reporting on the comparative therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of tenecteplase and alteplase is reviewed. SUMMARY: Tenecteplase is a variant of native tissue-type plasminogen activator, which rapidly promotes thrombolysis by catalyzing formation of the serine protease plasmin. Tenecteplase has theoretical advantages over alteplase as it has greater fibrin specificity and has a longer half-life than alteplase. This allows the administration of a single bolus over 5 to 10 seconds, as opposed to a bolus followed by a 1-hour infusion with alteplase. While currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, tenecteplase has also been studied in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and has extensive data for this off-label indication. The most comprehensive trials to date evaluating the use of tenecteplase in acute ischemic stroke include the TNK-S2B, Australian TNK, ATTEST, Nor-Test, and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. Findings from these randomized controlled studies suggest that tenecteplase is at least as efficacious as alteplase in terms of neurological outcomes. The majority of these studies also reported a trend toward improved safety profiles with the use of tenecteplase. CONCLUSION: Current clinical evidence shows that tenecteplase is not inferior to alteplase for the treatment of ischemic stroke and suggests that tenecteplase may have a superior safety profile. Furthermore, tenecteplase also has practical advantages in terms of its administration. This can potentially lead to a decrease in medication errors and improvement in door to thrombolytic time.","output":"Tenecteplase use in the management of acute ischemic stroke: Literature review and clinical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral bronchiolitis is common, and about 98C99% of infants are managed in the home.

This virus has now been spread to 27 countries with a total of 858 deaths and 2,494 confirmed cases and has become a serious concern for the human population. Camels are well known for the transmission of the virus to the human population. METHODS: In this report, we have discussed the designing, prediction, and evaluation of potential siRNAs against the orf1ab gene of MERS-CoV. The online software was used to predict and design the siRNAs and finally, total twenty-one siRNA were filtered out from four hundred and sixty-two sIRNAs as per their scoring and specificity criteria. We have used only ten siRNAs to evaluate their cytotoxicity and efficacy by reverse transfection approach in HEK-293-T cell lines. RESULTS: Based on the results and data generated; no cytotoxicity was observed for any siRNAs at various concentrations in HEK-293-T cells. The ct value of real-time PCR showed the inhibition of viral replication in siRNA-1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.

In addition, results showed that relational experiences throughout the day, including loneliness, challenges maintaining relationships, and communication quality, were linked to end-of-day COVID-19 optimism and state hope. Overall, this study identifies potential ways in which young adults? relational lives were altered during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Results also suggest how relational experiences factor into daily social constructions of the pandemic.","output":"Day-to-day relational life during the COVID-19 pandemic: Linking mental health, daily relational experiences, and end-of-day outlook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"German Abstract: Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Reaktionen der Politik C sowohl seitens Regierungen als auch seitens der Opposition C auf die COVID-19-Pandemie in ausgew?hlten L?ndern in einem kurzen berblick darzulegen C und zwar insbesondere im Hinblick darauf, inwieweit diese zu einem Vorwand fr die Konsolidierung von Macht, die Einschr?nkung von Brgerrechten sowie weitere Vorgangsweisen wurden, die als gef?hrlich fr Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit betrachtet werden k?nnen.

However, studies examining outcomes of patients admitted to hospitals not in crisis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristic and outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals not in crisis, and factors associated with mortality in this population. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis PARTICIPANTS: In total, 470 consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in one health system in Boston from January 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. MAIN MEASURES: We collected clinical outcomes during hospitalization including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, receipt of mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors. We utilized multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors associated with mortality. KEY RESULTS: A total of 470 patients (median age 66 [range 23-98], 54.0% male) were included. The most common comorbidities were diabetes (38.5%, 181/470) and obesity (41.3%, 194/470). On admission, 41.9% (197/470) of patients were febrile and 60.6% (285/470) required supplemental oxygen. During hospitalization, 37.9% (178/470) were admitted to the ICU, 33.6% (158/470) received mechanical ventilation, 29.4% (138/470) received vasopressors, 16.4% (77/470) reported limitations on their desire for life-sustaining therapies such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 25.1% (118/470) died. Among those admitted to the ICU (N=178), the median number of days on the ventilator was 10 days (IQR 1-29), and 58.4% (104/178) were discharged alive. Older age (OR=1.04, P<0.001), male sex (OR=2.14, P=0.007), higher comorbidities (OR=1.20, P=0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission (2nd tertile: OR=4.07, P<0.001; 3rd tertile: OR=8.04, P<0.001), and the need for supplemental oxygen on admission (OR=2.17, P=0.014) were all associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and those who received mechanical ventilation survived. These data highlight the need to examine public health and system factors that contribute to improved outcomes for this population.","output":"Clinical Outcomes of Patients Hospitalized with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Boston"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations sometimes increase contagiousness for evolving pathogens.

Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically. In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined Visions (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals.

METHODS: Care-home residency was identified via a national primary care registration database linked to mortality data. Life expectancy was estimated using Makeham-Gompertz models, to (i) describe yearly life expectancy from November 2015 to October 2020 (ii) compare life expectancy (during 2016-2018) between care-home residents and the wider population and (iii) apply care-home life expectancy estimates to COVID-19 death counts to estimate years of life lost (YLL). RESULTS: Among care-home residents, life expectancy in 2015/16 to 2019/20 ranged from 2.7 to 2.3 years for women and 2.3 to 1.8 years for men. Age-sex specific life expectancy in 2016-2018 in care-home residents was lower than in the Scottish population (10 and 2.5 years in those aged 70 and 90 respectively). Applying care-home specific life expectancies to COVID-19 deaths yields, mean YLLs for care-home residents of 2.6 and 2.2 for women and men respectively. In total YLL care-home residents have lost 3,560 years in women and 2,046 years in men. Approximately half of deaths and a quarter of YLL attributed to COVID-19 were accounted for by the 5% of over-70s who were care-home residents. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection has led to the loss of substantial years of life in care-home residents aged 70 years and over in Scotland.

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified. Method We analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed. Results A total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years (range: 1-81 years) and information on the symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 56.0% were asymptomatic cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year, 12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year, 12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 5% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds. Conclusions A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted.

METHODS: The number of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases in three university-affiliated hospitals during the pandemic and their clinical features were compared with lung cancer cases diagnosed during the same period in the past 3 years. The effectiveness of measures taken by the study hospitals to prevent nosocomial transmission was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 612 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer from February through June, 2017C2020. During the pandemic, the number of patients who sought consultation at the division of pulmonology of study hospitals dropped by 16% from the previous year. Responding to the pandemic, the involved hospitals created physically isolated triage areas for patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Wide-range screening and preventive measures were implemented, thus minimizing the delay in lung cancer diagnosis. No patient acquired COVID-19 due to hospital exposure.

Proteomics and reactive cysteine profiling link the antiviral activity of repurposed mucolytic agents to the reduction of key disulfides, specifically, by disruption of the Cys379CCys432 and Cys391CCys525 pairs distal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. Computational analyses provide insight into conformation changes that occur when these disulfides break or form, consistent with an allosteric role, and indicate that P2119/P2165 target a conserved hydrophobic binding pocket in the RBD with the benzyl thiol warhead pointed directly towards Cys432.

The first COVID-19 lockdown in England, beginning in March 2020, necessitated Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) providers to conduct many consultations and assessments remotely, where remotely is defined as in a format other than in-person (such as a telephone or video call). However, such practices were previously uncommon, hence little is known about whether service users feel that these remote ways of working can continue to meet their healthcare needs. This study aims to investigate whether remote CAMHS consultations and assessments are as acceptable to children and young people (CYP) and their parents or carers as the in-person equivalents.ObjectivesTo assess the acceptability of the newly remote practices of a CAMHS Intensive Outreach Team implemented during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 23rd 2020 C May 30th 2020). This was facilitated through telephone interviews with the CYP (aged 0C17) who accessed the service during this time, along with their parents or carers.MethodsThe emergency departments of three hospitals within the same region of England were used to source participants for the study, along with a CAMHS Intensive Outreach Team serving the same locality. A database of CYP who were referred to this outreach team from these emergency departments during the first COVID-19 lockdown was generated (n=84), along with their primary parent or carer (n=84). All were invited to the study by a postal letter (n=168), and telephone interviews were carried out with those who responded to the letter. Acceptability was assessed through questions inviting a rating on a 10-point Likert scale. The questions assessed whether the service user felt supported and heard and respected, during their consultation, and whether they were happy with it. Of the participants, some had consulted with the CAMHS team in-person, and others had consulted with them remotely. Responses from each category were separated after the data collection phase, to allow for statistical comparison of the results between the in-person and remote consultation groups.ResultsTelephone interviews were conducted with 36 CYP, and 77 parents or carers. Results were statistically analysed through use of an independent two-tailed T-test. Of the CYP, there was no significant difference between the Likert ratings of acceptability for in-person consultations (n=27, M=8.7) and remote consultations (n=9, M=9.3), conditions t(29)=2.064, p = 0.020. Of the parents or carers, there was also no significant difference between the Likert ratings of acceptability for in-person consultations (n=53, M=8.1) and remote consultations (n=24, M=7.9) conditions t(56)=0.586, p=2.667.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique avenue to investigate whether previously uncommon remote ways of working are as acceptable to CAMH service users in the mainstream. Our findings support the idea that remote CAMH consultations are just as acceptable to both CYP and their parents or carers as their in-person equivalents, suggesting that their continued use could be a welcome addition to mainstream practice.","output":"CAMHS intensive outreach during COVID-19 lockdown: how did changes necessitated by COVID-19 impact satisfaction with the service?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The left atrial (LA) appendage (LAA) is the main source of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation. This study addressed initial pressure resistance of surgical LAA closures. METHODS In an experimental model, pneumatic pressure resistances of different surgical closure techniques were examined, and variations in technique and access were studied. In preparations of the LA from freshly slaughtered pigs, pneumatic pressure was applied to the LAA. Burst pressures (mbar) of various closure techniques (n = 12 specimens per group) were measured: (1) epicardial double-layer suture, (2) epicardial stapler closure (staple height 2 mm), (3) epicardial stapler closure (staple height 4, 4.5, and 5 mm), (4) endocardial inverse double-layer suture, (5) endocardial inverse stapler seam (staple height 2 mm), and (6) endocardial inverse stapler seam (staple height 4, 4.5, and 5 mm). RESULTS The mean burst pressure in group 1 was 175.5  19.35 mbar. There was no significant difference compared with group 2 (174.5  28.45 mbar) or group 3 (176  27.69 mbar).

In designing the questionnaire, ten items from the Technology Readiness Index (TRI 2.0) were adapted to determine the technology readiness of respondents. Furthermore, descriptive statistics were used to establish the common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, platforms, and teaching approaches adopted by lecturers and estimate the technological readiness of students.

From the findings in this study, it can be seen that male students are more likely to adjust faster than female students to RL. This result is consistent with some of the findings in the literature. Learning from home or other environments outside the university has been proven ineffective as students can get easily distracted by external factors that can affect their learning and understanding. This becomes more difficult for female students, especially in Africa, where it is believed that specific responsibilities are for girls.

Realising that SHW shortages occur due to existing push-and-pull factors within and between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs), we sought to answer the question: \\"how, why, and under what circumstance does the RTH offer utility for addressing SHW shortages in LMICs?\\" METHODS We conducted a realist synthesis of evidence identified through a systematic search of peer-reviewed articles in Embase, Global Health, Medline (Ovid), ProQuest - Health & Medical databases, Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate), CINAHL (EBSCO), APAIS-Health, Health Systems Evidence and PDQ-EVIDENCE; as well as grey literature from Google Scholar. RESULTS We found that the RTH offers utility for addressing SHW shortages in LMICs through HIC state actors' concerns for their countries' reputational risk, recognition of their obligation to support health workforce strengthening in LMICs, and concerns for the cost implication. State actors in LMICs will respond to adopt programs inspired by the RTH when they are convinced that it offers tangible national benefits and are not overly burdened with ensuring its success. The socio-economic and institutional factors that constrain state actors' response include financial cost and sustainability of rights'-based options.

The validity of virtual reality (VR) simulation curricula for psychomotor assessment and skill acquisition for the early phase of robotic surgery training has been demonstrated. The widespread adoption of VR simulation has been limited by the high cost of these machines. Live animal and cadavers have been the accepted standard for robotic surgical simulation since it began in the early 2000s. Our review found that there is a lack of evidence in the literature to support the use of animal and cadaver for robotic surgery training. The effectiveness of these models as a training tool is limited by logistical, ethical, financial and infection control issues. The latest evolution in synthetic organ model training for robotic surgery has been driven by new 3D-printing technology. Validated and cost-effective high-fidelity procedural models exist for robotic surgery training in urology. The development of synthetic models for the other specialties is not as mature. Expansion into multiple surgical disciplines and the widespread adoption of synthetic organ models for robotic simulation training will require the ability to engineer scalability for mass production.

Individuals may manage feeling fat via eating pathology (e.g., binge eating or dietary restriction) rather than address the source of negative affect. Thus, feeling fat may occur in the absence of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative affect widely and may potentially contribute to the experience of feeling fat and eating pathology among individuals with emotion dysregulation. This study examined whether emotion dysregulation moderates feeling fat's role as a mechanism underlying the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and eating pathology. This uniqueness of this model to eating pathology was investigated by comparing effects for binge eating and dietary restriction versus anxiety, depression, and problematic alcohol use. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze questionnaire data from 877 participants (77.3% women). Feeling fat explained significant variance in the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and both binge eating and restriction. Emotion dysregulation modulated the strength of these relationships. However, feeling fat's role in the relationship between pandemic-related distress and negative psychological outcomes was not unique to eating pathology and did not vary based upon emotion dysregulation. Individuals with elevated emotion dysregulation are more likely to report eating pathology, but not other outcomes, in the context of feeling fat. In contrast, feeling fat underlies the relationship between COVID-19-distress and transdiagnostic psychological outcomes, meaning feeling fat should be considered in risk for psychopathology beyond eating disorders.","output":"Feeling fat amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Examining the role of emotion dysregulation in the body displacement hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The news media play an important role in communicating health topics to the public (Hallin the first deaths;and the World Health Organisation?s declaration of a global pandemic.

Few conservation planning and policy initiatives have implemented the SESF to assess the interlinked social and ecological consequences of conservation policies. We apply the SESF to explore the barriers to the potential implementation of a policy of consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya, a policy regarded as successful in several southern African countries. Using secondary data and expert review we developed a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya. We then analysed how different combinations of first and second-tier variables interacted to create focal action situations, and subsequently identified seven barriers to this policy. Our analysis revealed that game ranching would require large-scale investment in effective monitoring systems, new regulations, training, market development and research, considerations about equity, and devolved ownership of wildlife. The least barriers existed for game farming. The SESF appears to be a useful framework for this purpose. In particular, it can help to reveal potential social and ecological barriers which conservation policies might face in attempting to meet intended goals.

METHODS Data are from annual, cross-sectional, nationally representative Monitoring the Future (MTF) surveys of 85 547 8th, 10th and 12th grade students surveyed between 2012 and 2020. Analyses include trends in past 30-day menthol and non-menthol cigarette smoking among the total adolescent population, as well as stratified by race/ethnicity. RESULTS Declines in adolescent menthol and non-menthol cigarette smoking continued through 2020 so that in 2018-2020 past 30-day prevalence for each was less than 1% for non-Hispanic black adolescents and less than 2.2% for non-black adolescents. For non-Hispanic black adolescents no smoking declines in mentholated or non-mentholated cigarette use from 2015-2017 to 2018-2020 were statistically significant, in part because prevalence levels approached a floor effect and had little room to fall further. Menthol levels were lower for non-Hispanic black versus all other adolescents in all study years. CONCLUSIONS Continuing declines in adolescent menthol prevalence indicate that both menthol prevalence and also black/non-black disparities in its use are steadily decreasing. However, these decreases in adolescence will take decades to reach later ages through generational replacement. Efforts to accelerate menthol decreases will require new initiatives to increase cessation among adult menthol users.","output":"Recent, national trends in US adolescent use of menthol and non-menthol cigarettes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las coinfecciones entre SARS-CoV-2 y otros patgenos son una cuestin importante para el tratamiento de los pacientes con COVID-19.

METHODS We examined across-Club consecutive interactions 2 minutes within 6 feet [1.8 meters] between athletes on opposing Clubs for all 2020 NFL regular season games (n=256). Cumulative interaction was measured for a representative subset (n=119; 46%) of games. Wearable proximity tracking devices (Kinexon) were used to measure distance and duration of interactions; these data were combined with game schedule and Club rosters for analyses. Frequency and per-game mean, median, interquartile range for consecutive interactions 2/5 minutes and cumulative interactions 5/15 were described overall and stratified by pre-game, in-game and post-game. RESULTS Of the1,964 distinct player-to-opponent contacts 2 minutes in NFL regular season games, the majority (n=1,699; 87%) were fewer than 5 minutes in consecutive length. Among the mean 7.7 distinct contacts 2 minutes with opponents each game (median=4; IQR=2, 8), very few were 5 consecutive minutes at any point (mean=1.0; median=0; IQR=0, 0). Most (n=849; 43.2%) distinct contacts were pre-game, 546 (27.8%) were during competition, and 569 (29%) were post-game. In games where cumulative interactions were analyzed, there was an average of 17.1 player/opponent interactions with cumulative exposure 5 minutes (median=12; IQR=4, 30), almost all of which occurred during competition. CONCLUSION There is limited and short contact between and among competing players in professional American football. In the setting of infectious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a robust prevention program integrating masking, distancing, hygiene and ventilation when off-field can be created to minimize on-and-off-field exposures, which effectively reduces transmission risk in outdoors and/or well-ventilated stadium settings.","output":"Anatomy of an American football game: Player to player contact before, during and after an NFL game in context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To develop and test a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination intervention that includes healthcare team training activities and patient reminders to reduce missed opportunities and improves the rate of appointment scheduling for HPV vaccination in a rural medical clinic in the United States. Methods: The multi-level and multi-component intervention included healthcare team training activities and the distribution of patient education materials along with technology-based patient HPV vaccination reminders for parents/caregivers and young adult patients. Missed vaccination opportunities were assessed pre- and post-intervention (n = 402 and n = 99, respectively) by retrospective chart review and compared using Pearson (2). The patient parent/caregiver and young adult patient population (n = 80) was surveyed following the reminder messages and penalized logistic regression quantified unadjusted odds of scheduling a visit. Results: Missed opportunities for HPV vaccination declined significantly from the pre-intervention to the post-intervention period (21.6 vs. 8.1%, respectively, p = 0.002). Participants who recalled receipt of a vaccination reminder had 7.0 (95% CI 2.4C22.8) times higher unadjusted odds of scheduling a visit compared with those who did not recall receiving a reminder. The unadjusted odds of confirming that they had scheduled or were intending to schedule a follow-up appointment to receive the HPV vaccine was 4.9 (95% CI 1.51C20.59) times greater among those who had not received the vaccine for themselves or for their child.

Whether these patterns were present in public hospitals is unknown. The aim of this brief study was to investigate COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system during the initial pandemic response. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on COVID-19 admissions in New York City public hospitals during the exponential phase of the pandemic. All data were collected from an integrated electronic medical records system (Epic Health Systems, Verona, WI). Overall, 5,422 patients with at least one admission each for COVID-19 were reviewed, with a study of demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, BMI), pregnancy status, comorbidities, facility activity, and outcomes. Data related to hospitalization and mortality trends were also collected from City of New York website. These data often involved more than one facility and/or service line resulting in more location or treatment facility counts than patients due to utilization of services at more than one location and transfers between locations and facilities. Results: Higher mortality was associated with increasing age with the highest death rate (51.9%) noted in the age group >75 years (OR 7.88, 95%CI 6.32-10.08). Comorbidities with higher mortality included diabetes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.33-1.70), hypertension (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44-1.83), cardiovascular conditions (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.47-1.87), COPD (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.50). It was deduced that 20% of all New York City COVID-19 positive admissions were in public health system during this timeframe. A high proportion of admissions (21.26%) and deaths (19.93%) were at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. Bellevue and Metropolitan Hospitals had the lowest number of deaths, both in borough of Manhattan. Mortality in public hospitals in Brooklyn was 29.9%, Queens 28.1%, Manhattan 20.4%. Conclusion: Significant variations existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system in New York City during the initial pandemic.

METHODS: This retrospective single-institution analysis compared the clinical pathological characteristics of BC diagnosed between May 2020 and July 2020, after a 2-month screening interruption, with BC diagnosed in the same trimester of 2019 when mammographic screening was regularly carried out. RESULTS: The 2-month stop in mammographic screening produced a significant decrease in in situ BC diagnosis (-10.4%) and an increase in node-positive (+11.2%) and stage III BC (+10.3%). A major impact was on the subgroup of patients with BC at high proliferation rates. Among these, the rate of node-positive BC increased by 18.5% and stage III by 11.4%. In the subgroup of patients with low proliferation rates, a 9.3% increase in stage III tumors was observed, although node-positive tumors remained stable. Despite screening interruption, procedures to establish a definitive diagnosis and treatment start were subsequently carried out without delay. CONCLUSION: Our data showed an increase in node-positive and stage III BC after a 2-month stop in BC screening.

In the cases of site basis dephasing the interplay between the energy gap of the excited dimer states and the environment is shown to give rise to a turnover effect in the efficiency under weak dimer coupling conditions. Furthermore, the nature of the coherences and associated flux are interpreted in terms of pathway interference effects.

This is the first study that has used departmental h index-and e index-based matrices to assess the academic output of neuroendovascular, neurointerventional, and interventional radiology fellowship programs across the continental US. METHODS Fellowship program listings were identified from academic and organization websites. Details for 37 programs were available. Bibliometric data for these programs were gathered from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. Citations for each publication from the fellowship's parent department were screened, and the h and e indices were calculated from non-open-surgical, central nervous system vascular publications. Variables including \\"high-productivity\\" centers, fellowship-comprehensive stroke center affiliation, fellowship accreditation status, neuroendovascular h index, e index ( h index supplement), h10 index (publications during the last 10 years), and departmental faculty-based h indices were created and analyzed. RESULTS A positive correlation was seen between the neuroendovascular fellowship h index and corresponding h10 index (R = 0.885; p < 0.0001). The mean, median, and highest faculty-based h indices exhibited positive correlations with the neuroendovascular fellowship h index (R = 0.662, p < 0.0001; R = 0.617, p < 0.0001; and R = 0.649, p < 0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference (p = 0.824) in the median values for the fellowship h index based on comprehensive stroke center affiliation (30 of 37 programs had such affiliations) or accreditation (18 of 37 programs had accreditation) (p = 0.223). Based on the quartile analysis of the fellowship h index, 10 of 37 departments had an neuroendovascular h index of  54 (\\"high-productivity\\" centers); these centers had significantly more faculty (p = 0.013) and a significantly higher mean faculty h index (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The departmental h index and analysis of its publication topics can be used to calculate the h index of an associated subspecialty. The analysis was focused on the neuroendovascular specialty, and this methodology can be extended to other neurosurgical subspecialties. Individual faculty research interest is directly reflected in the research productivity of a department.

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days.

The current scientific consensus recommended breast-feed milk for all newborns for at least 6 months. They stated that it is possible to meet the nutritional needs of two or more newborns with only one mothers milk. More information would be desirable about the factors that influence or lead to the initiation and interruption of breastfeeding. The quality of the evidence available from multiple studies has been inconclusive and therefore led to controversial interpretations and practices. Aims: The first aim of this study was to analyze the extent of the feeding of multiples with breast milk in the experience of our clinical unit in terms of incidence and duration. The second objective was to evaluate the correlation between maternal, perinatal and neonatal variables with breast milk feeding rates and duration. Methods: The study was conducted between 2015 and 2020, in a NICU in Southern Italy (San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia). Sixty-one women who have given birth to multiples were enrolled into the study. Newborn data were retrospectively collected by informatic database and breastfeeding information were collected by a questionnaire. Results: In our centre, the percentage of twins out of the total number of births over the years has almost doubled from 1.28% in 2015 to 2.48% in 2020 and the 88% of twins are premature. 18.1% received breast milk for more than 6 months and 6.3% received it for more than 12 months. Infants of lower gestational age and weight, born to multiparous, more mature and medium-high schooling mothers received breast milk for a longer period. 35% of women explained that the interruption of breastfeeding was due to the insufficient milk production and 41% to the stress and difficulties in managing the twins. Qualitative analysis of maternal narrative revealed, for many of them, the awareness of the importance of breastfeeding and the efforts made to try to give breast milk, but also fears about the quantity of milk and satiety of their children.

Since BCIs rely solely on brain activity, they have enormous potential as an alternative access method for engaging children with severe disabilities and/or medical complexities in therapeutic recreation and leisure. In particular, one commercially available BCI platform is the Emotiv EPOC headset, which is a portable and affordable electroencephalography (EEG) device. Combined with the EmotivBCI software, the Emotiv system can generate a model to discern between different mental tasks based on the user's EEG signals in real-time. While the Emotiv system shows promise for use by the pediatric population in the setting of a BCI clinic, it lacks integrated support that allows users to directly control computer applications using the generated classification output. To achieve this, users would have to create their own program, which can be challenging for those who may not be technologically inclined. To address this gap, we developed a freely available and user-friendly BCI software application called EmoconLite. Using the classification output from EmotivBCI, EmoconLite allows users to play YouTube video clips and a variety of video games from multiple platforms, ultimately creating an end-to-end solution for users. Through its deployment in the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital's BCI clinic, EmoconLite is bridging the gap between research and clinical practice, providing children with access to BCI technology and supporting BCI-enabled play.","output":"EmoconLite: Bridging the Gap Between Emotiv and Play for Children With Severe Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oncogenic gammaherpesviruses express viral products during latent and lytic infection that block the innate immune response. Previously, we found that Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV/human herpesvirus-8) viral microRNAs (miRNAs) downregulate cholesterol biogenesis, and we hypothesized that this prevents the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol derivative. 25HC blocks KSHV de novo infection of primary endothelial cells at a postentry step and decreases viral gene expression of LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen) and RTA. Herein we expanded on this observation by determining transcriptomic changes associated with 25HC treatment of primary endothelial cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We found that 25HC treatment inhibited KSHV gene expression and induced interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and several inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 8 [IL-8], IL-1). Some 25HC-induced genes were partially responsible for the broadly antiviral effect of 25HC against several viruses. Additionally, we found that 25HC inhibited infection of primary B cells by a related oncogenic virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV/human herpesvirus-4) by suppressing key viral genes such as LMP-1 and inducing apoptosis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that IL-1 and IL-8 pathways were induced by 25HC in both primary endothelial cells and B cells. We also found that the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which converts cholesterol to 25HC, can be induced by type I interferon (IFN) in human B cell-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We propose a model wherein viral miRNAs target the cholesterol pathway to prevent 25HC production and subsequent induction of antiviral ISGs. Together, these results answer some important questions about a widely acting antiviral (25HC), with implications for multiple viral and bacterial infections.","output":"25-Hydroxycholesterol Inhibits Kaposis Sarcoma Herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr Virus Infections and Activates Inflammatory Cytokine Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous advanced MR imaging and computed tomographic techniques have been developed and implemented in clinical practice over the past several years resulting in increased diagnostic accuracy and improved patient care.

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes for pediatric LDLT and deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) via systematic review. Methods A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies reporting outcomes of pediatric (<18 y) LDLT and DDLT published between 2005 and 2019. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine peri- and postoperative outcomes using fixed- and random-effects models. Results Overall, 2518 abstracts were screened, and 10 studies met criteria for inclusion. In total, 1622 LDLT and 6326 DDLT pediatric patients from 4 continents were examined. LDLT resulted in superior patient survival when compared with DDLT at 1, 3, and 5 y post-LT (1-y hazard ratio: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.73, P < 0.0001). Similarly, LDLT resulted in superior graft survival at all time points post-LT when compared with DDLT (1-y hazard ratio: 0.56 [95% CI 0.46-0.68], P < 0.0001]. The OR for vascular complications was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39-1.39) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.92-1.86) for biliary complications in LDLT compared with DDLT, whereas LDLT was associated with lower rates of rejection (OR: 0.66 [95% CI 0.45-0.96], P = 0.03).

Data analytic tools can not only improve laboratory operations, but also increase the visibility of the laboratory in the healthcare system and demonstrate the positive impact of the laboratory on patient care. In this article, we describe the creation and utility of laboratory dashboards. Several dashboards were designed to assist with pandemic response. For each dashboard, a stored procedure was created that performed a SQL query of our laboratory information system mirror database. We utilized the business analytics platform, Tableau, for data visualization. Users could modify the data by selecting a specific date range, time window, work shift, institution(s), specific test(s), and/or testing platform(s). Access was controlled by OKTA integration to the host server over the web, behind the hospital firewall. During the April 2020 surge, we saw an increase in blood gas testing and corresponding decrease in non-critical testing such as Vitamin D. At our institution, SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing was performed using four primary platforms, four in-house and one send-out. Weekly and hourly testing volumes as well as turnaround times fluctuated based on reagent availability, new testing requests, staffing, and operational changes. Productivity dashboards indicated that coagulation testing volumes were highest on the third shift and that all three analyzers may not be necessary. Further, specimen volumes and productivity of accessioning staff varied throughout the day. Phlebotomy venipuncture volumes and patient wait times also varied throughout the pandemic. A decrease in ambulatory draws was seen during the surge but after reopening draw volumes, particularly at offsite locations, surpassed prepandemic volumes.

Here, we explore the dynamics of liquid plug transport using an anatomically-relevant, true-scale in vitro 3D model of the upper airways of a premature infant. We quantify the initial plug's distribution as a function of two underlying parameters that can be clinically controlled; namely, the injection flow rate and the viscosity of the administered fluid. By extracting a homogeneity index (HI), our in vitro results underline how the combination of both high fluid viscosity and injection flow rates may be advantageous in improving homogeneous dispersion.

Variations in the duration and number of spray cycles for the same dosimetry were compared. RESULTS Bronchoscopic SCT of the airway resulted in cellular death up to the cartilage layer. Endoscopic SCT of the oesophagus led to cell death up to the adventitial layer. Tissue necrosis was severe in the lung, of full thickness in the pleura, but very superficial in the great vessels. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of treated tissues remained well-preserved. Having shorter but more cycles of SCT decreased the depth of the cellular necrosis. One pig developed ventricular fibrillation during the surgery and expired.

We calculated the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China as of 31 May 2013 to provide an example of comprehensive burden of disease in the 21st century from an acute animal-borne emerging infectious disease. DESIGN: We present an accurate and operable method for estimating the burden of H7N9 cases in China. The main drivers of economic loss were identified. Costs were broken down into direct (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and losses in the poultry industry), which were estimated based on field surveys and China statistical year book. SETTING: Models were applied to estimate the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China. PARTICIPANTS: 131 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases by 31 May 2013. OUTCOME MEASURE: Burden of H7N9 cases including direct and indirect losses. RESULTS: The total direct medical cost was 16 422 535 (US$2 627 606). The mean cost for each patient was 10 117 (US$1619) for mild patients, 139 323 (US$22 292) for severe cases without death and 205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases with death. The total cost of DALYs was 17 356 561 (US$2 777 050). The poultry industry losses amounted to 7.75 billion (US$1.24 billion) in 10 affected provinces and 3.68 billion (USD$0.59 billion) in eight non-affected adjacent provinces. CONCLUSIONS: The huge poultry industry losses followed live poultry markets closing down and poultry slaughtering in some areas. Though the proportion of direct medical losses and DALYs losses in the estimate of H7N9 burden was small, the medical costs per case were extremely high (particularly for addressing the use of modern medical devices).

We report a case of successful surgical treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic pain after inguinal hernia by laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. CASE PRESENTATION A seventy-year-old male who underwent right-side inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein method revisited our hospital with inguinodynia 16 months after surgery. After a thorough assessment, the patient was diagnosed with neuropathic pain based on the following: 1) dermatomal mapping suggested ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve problems, 2) pain was evoked by specific movement, 3) the site of maximum pain was slightly changed at every physical examination, and 4) no evidence of recurrence or meshoma was observed on MRI. Conservative therapies were ineffective. Surgical intervention using laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy was performed 4 months after treatment initiation. In the lateral recumbent position, a three-port method was used. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves were identified and resected. Although a residual nerve emerged from L2/3 toward the inguinal region, the nerve remained in situ. Pain assessment 3h after surgery revealed that pain was decreased but remained. Reoperation involving resection of the residual nerve was performed on the same day. Although another type of mild pain appeared 3 months after surgery, the patient resumed normal life, without any restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy is useful for treating refractory neuropathic pain.

Supplementary analyses were conducted observing healthcare use patterns within rural and urban clinics separately and within primary care and specialty clinics separately. FINDINGS: Patients in rural clinics vs. urban clinics had worse health status [(2) = 935.1, df = 3, p<0.0001]. Additionally, patients in rural clinics had lower healthcare utilization than patients in urban clinics, adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking, and health status [2.49 vs. 3.18 visits, RR = 0.61, 95%CI = (0.55,0.68), p<0.0001]. Further, patients in rural clinics had lower utilization for both primary care and specialty care visits. CONCLUSIONS: Within the large healthcare system, patients in rural clinics had lower outpatient healthcare utilization compared to their urban counterparts despite having potentially elevated health needs reflected by a higher number of unique health diagnoses documented in their electronic health records after adjusting for multiple factors. This work can inform future studies exploring the roots and ramifications of rural-urban healthcare utilization differences and rural healthcare disparities.","output":"Quantifying rural disparity in healthcare utilization in the United States: Analysis of a large midwestern healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, efforts have been made to fill a so-called \\"vaccine gap\\" between Japan and other countries; however, more work remains.

Individuals diagnosed with psychotic illness tend to first exhibit psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), defined as subclinical psychotic symptoms that occur outside the context of sleep or drug use. However, there is a paucity of empirical data on PLEs in pregnancy to advance scholarly discourse and support professional practice. The current study investigated the prevalence and correlates of PLEs among pregnant women in Ghana, a West African state. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from 702 pregnant women who responded to measures of PLEs, COVID-19 concerns and behavioral maladies such as anxiety and depressive symptoms. Descriptive and inferential statistics, namely chi square, exploratory factor analysis, MANOVA and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results showed that 54.2%, 27.3% and 18.5% of participants were at no/low, moderate and high risk for psychosis, respectively. A total of 44.4% participants were not distressed by PLEs, whereas 32.2% and 23.4% were a bit/quite and very distressed, respectively. Psychosis risk was elevated among pregnant women who were more concerned about the COVID-19 effects, scored high in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and sleep difficulties. CONCLUSION: The study showed that psychosis risk is present in pregnancy.

Moreover, a weak, irregular, or inhibited early interferon response to SARS CoV-2 infection was shown to trigger an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to the COVID-19 associated mortality. Thus, repurposing of drugs that possess anti-inflammatory and/or immune-modulatory effects for COVID-19 is considered a rational approach. Areas covered We present a concise analysis and interpretations of selected studies that correlated COVID-19 with dysregulated interferon and inflammatory responses while reflecting on our academic and real-life experience using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nitazoxanide and azithromycin for management of COVID-19. Moreover, we interpret the recent results that suggested a potential survival benefit of low dose aspirin and colchicine when used for COVID-19. Expert opinion Nitazoxanide/azithromycin combination has been first hypothesized by the author and practiced by him and several researchers to benefit COVID-19 patients due to a potential ability to augment the natural interferon response as well as their positive immunomodulatory effects on several cytokines. Furthermore, NSAIDs, that were unfortunately almost globally avoided early in the COVID-19 era and still avoided in many developing ones or at best of second choice in the developed ones, have been early postulated and clinically practiced by the author to prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 complications and mortality due to their ability to prevent, constrain or reverse COVID-19 associated dysregulated immune and hyper-inflammatory responses through mitigating the formation of several inflammatory cytokines and pathways including the interleukin-6 amplifier and its NF-kB component, as well as modulation of a described monocytic immunological dysrhythmia, which is also known to trigger the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Finally, we repeat our previous call to adopt our observational study that used these drugs in sufficiently powered double blind randomized clinical trials as COVID-19 potential safe and economic cure might be available and unfortunately repeatedly ignored for one year.","output":"NSAIDs/Nitazoxanide/Azithromycin Repurposed for COVID-19: Potential Mitigation of the Cytokine Storm Interleukin-6 Amplifier via Immunomodulatory Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the clinical manifestations of the clinical characteristics of 141 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the imaging evolution characteristics of High Resolution CT (HRCT) in the chest.

The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 141 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: Laboratory examinations of 141 COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in white blood cell count and lymphocyte ratio. Among the 141 patients with COVID-19, fever (>37.5 a??) was the most common clinical manifestation in 139 cases (98.58%) , and occasionally non-respiratory symptoms such as diarrhea in 4 cases (2.84%) . 141 patients with COVID-19 had abnormal HRCT. 52 (36.88%) chest HRCT images showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) , mainly under pleural; 23 (16.31%) GGO with focal consolidation; 27 (19.15%) small flaky shadows; 20 cases (14.18%) large flaky consolidation shadows; 48 cases (34.04%) bronchovascular bundle thickening and vascular penetrating signs; 5 cases (3.55%) had air bronchial signs; 7 cases (4.96%) of small nodule shadows; 5 cases (3.55%) of fibrosis, grid shadows or strand shadows.135 cases (95.74%) were positive for the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (4.26%) were negative, and 71 cases (50.35%) of common type, 47 cases (33.33%) of severe type and 23 cases (16.31%) of critical type were found during the same period. The average time from onset of each type to the first CT examination was: (2.511.32) , (5.022.01) , and (5.911.76) days; 19 (19/47, 40.43%) of which were severe for the first time CT classification worsened at the second examination and lessened at the third examination. 141 cases (100%) were positive for the second nucleic acid test, and the HRCT results for the same period were 44 cases (31.21%) of common type, 53 cases (37.59%) of severe type, and 44 cases (31.21%) of critical type; the average interval time was (3.321.61) , (3.931.84) , (4.151.57) days;the third nucleic acid test were positive among 113 cases and 28 cases were negative, HRCT results of the same period were 79 cases (56.03%) of common type, 46 cases (32.62%) of severe type, and 16 cases (11.35%) of critical type;the average interval from the first CT examination were: (5.591.83) , (7.321.37) , (7.551.78) days.

Aims: The main objective of the study is to assess the results of the application of telematic consultations to limit the mobility of patients. The operational objectives are; to propose a consultation plan, to know how attendance limits consultations and to define which pathologies benefit the most from this plan. Methods: A scheme is proposed with the creation of pre-scheduled clinic to assess suitability and the possibility of carrying them out in a single non face-to-face act. Results: Phone call to 5619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19% The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, OR=0.60, or to general trauma ones, OR=0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department. Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, OR=0.34, postoperative control, OR=0.49, and specific unit ones, OR=0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement. Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, OR=0.50, and those referred to units, OR=0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. Conclusions: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests.

However, it was also recognized as a primary factor leading to hospital-acquired pulmonary dysfunction, in which pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation had been known to play important roles. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidant, and possesses anti-inflammatory capacity. In this study, we aimed to study the efficacy of Cu/Zn SOD, administered intravenously during high tidal volume (HTV) ventilation, to prevent impairment of lung function. METHODS: Thirty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: 5 h ventilation with (A) low tidal volume (LTV; 8 mL/kg; n = 10), (B) high tidal volume (HTV; 18 mL/kg; n = 14), or (C) HTV and intravenous treatment of Cu/Zn SOD at a dose of 1000 U/kg/h (HTV + SOD; n = 14). Lung function was evaluated both at baseline and after 5-h ventilation. Lung injury was assessed by histological examination, lung water and protein contents in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Pulmonary oxidative stress was examined by concentrations of methylguanidine (MG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in BALF, and antioxidative activity by protein expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in the lung. Severity of lung inflammation was evaluated by white blood cell and differential count in BALF, and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and mRNA expression of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) in the lung. We also examined protein expression of surfactant protein (SP)-A and D and we measured hourly changes in serum nitric oxide (NO) level. RESULTS: Five hours of LTV ventilation did not induce a major change in lung function, whereas 5 h of HTV ventilation induced apparent combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorder, together with increased pulmonary oxidative stress, decreased anti-oxidative activity and increased lung inflammation (P < 0.05). HTV ventilation also decreased SP-A and SP-D expression and suppressed serum NO level during the time course of ventilation. Cu/Zn SOD administered intravenously during HTV ventilation effectively reversed associated pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation (P < 0.05); moreover, it preserved SP-A and SP-D expressions in the lung and increased serum nitric oxide (NO) level, enhancing vascular NO bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: HTV ventilation can induce combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorders. Intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD during HTV ventilation can prevent lung function impairment and lung injury via reducing pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation, preserving pulmonary surfactant expression, and enhancing vascular NO bioavailability.","output":"Intravenous superoxide dismutase as a protective agent to prevent impairment of lung function induced by high tidal volume ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Here, we compared the results of occupant satisfaction with the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) obtained from the same cohort of employees who transitioned from three non-WELL (two BREEAM and one conventional) to three WELL-certified office buildings. For two out of three building pairs, we found a statistically significant increase in building and workspace satisfaction after relocation to WELL buildings. However, for 55 % of compared cases, there was insignificant difference as the result of relocation.

The pathophysiology and management of the COVID-19 coagulopathy are likely more complex in patients with inherited bleeding diseases such as haemophilia. These individuals might indeed present with both bleeding and thrombotic complications and require simultaneous antithrombotic and haemostatic treatments. OBJECTIVE: We propose practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 coagulopathy in persons with haemophilia. RESULTS: Continuation of regular haemostatic treatment is recommended for ambulatory patients. For patients requiring hospital admission and on replacement therapy with factors VIII or IX concentrates, prophylaxis with concentrates should be intensified according to the risk of bleeding complications and associated with prophylactic doses of LMWH. For patients on nonreplacement therapy, emicizumab should be continued and possibly combined with factor VIII and prophylactic doses of LMWH depending on the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Dose escalation of LMWH tailored to the risk of thrombosis can be employed but not supported by evidence. CONCLUSIONS: These practical recommendations are based on the current literature on COVID-19 with its impact on haemostasis, indications and modalities for thromboprophylaxis mainly in nonhaemophilic patients and how that is likely to affect persons with haemophilia in different circumstances.

We provide an overview of the interventions implemented at Montefiore and provide preliminary insights on the utilization and value of these ongoing services. OUTCOMES: The interventions instituted at Montefiore included: psychoeducational resources, a phone support line, staff support centers, a clinical treatment program, team support sessions, peer support outreach, mental health and wellness programs, and clergy support. The most heavily used service during the pandemic were the staff support centers and the least used service was the clergy support. INSIGHTS: With institutional encouragement and the collective efforts of over 150 mental health professionals and other staff it was possible to set up durable mental health supports with multiple points of access. Although many services were available to both clinical and non-clinical staff, outreach was primarily to clinical staff. Additional efforts in the future are needed to more fully reach non-clinical frontline workers.

Our aim was to compare satisfaction and convenience of virtual post-discharge follow-up for surgical patients and qualitatively analyze free-text survey responses in a randomized controlled noninferiority trial. Patient satisfaction with VVs has not been evaluated previously in a randomized controlled trial and few mixed-methods analyses have been done to understand barriers and facilitators to post-discharge visits. STUDY DESIGN: Patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy or cholecystectomy were randomized to VV or in-person visit (2:1). Surveys with 11 multiple-choice and 2 open-ended questions evaluated patient satisfaction and convenience. Univariate analysis compared responses to the multiple-choice questions and qualitative content analysis evaluated open-ended responses. RESULTS: Of 442 enrolled patients, 289 completed their postoperative visit and were sent surveys (55% response rate). Patients were categorized as VV (n = 135), crossover (randomized to virtual but completed in-person; n = 53), and in-person visits (n = 101). Patient-reported satisfaction was similar, but convenience was higher for VV patients. Open-ended responses (72 VVs, 14 crossovers, and 41 in-person visits) were qualitatively analyzed. In all groups, patient experience was influenced by quality of care, efficiency, and convenience. Barriers were different for virtual and in-person appointments. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quality of, and access to, care-whether in person or virtual-remained critical components of patient satisfaction.

In order to provide extraordinary outdoor experiences, as hiking, a diversity of trails with certain infrastructure and general conditions, is critical. Yet, little research has focused on evaluating the existing conditions on a systematic approach, and based on specific assessment instruments. This paper aims at building upon this research gap, by proposing the assessment of the trails and the potential for hiking activities, in Northern Portugal, a tourism destination increasingly known for its natural and green landscape, especially vacacioned for outdoor activities. Given their well preserved landscapes, and natural and cultural resources, protected areas lend themselves as preferred settings for outdoor activities. Therefore, a comparison of existing conditions, inside and outside PAs will be performed. The assessment matrix employed in this study is original and innovative, constructed based on the analysis of related literature, but mostly with contributions from various professionals of outdoor tourism activities. The results of the assessment process are discussed and opportunities for improvement are identified.","output":"Assessing Trails and Potential for Hiking Tourism in Northern Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting from China, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contagion spread unexpectedly and quickly all over the world, particularly affecting Italy. In the early stages of the epidemic, healthcare professionals have been in the front-line to manage the infection. The current study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals and to detect some risk and protective factors of their distress levels, with regard to socio-demographic variables, direct exposure to COVID-19 and the coping strategies used to deal with stress. The data were collected during the peak of the infection. A total of 595 healthcare professionals enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographical and professional data, perceived stress (PSS) and coping strategies (COPE- NVI-25). Overall, we found that a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while female gender, seeking social support, avoidance strategies and working with COVID-19 patients were risk factors. Economic status, problem solving ability and turning to religion were not associated with stress levels. This study, one of the first on this topic, highlighted the main coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the pandemic.","output":"Psychological effects of the COVID-2019 pandemic: Perceived stress and coping strategies among healthcare professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection prevalence is unknown. It is essential to understand reinfection symptoms and, importantly, the lived experience. CASE PRESENTATION: Case study design is the best method for understanding this contemporary pandemic and rare occurrence of reinfections. A 19-year-old White Non-Hispanic woman presented with presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection 6 weeks after initially mild symptomatic infection and consistent repeat negative results. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from saliva was used for detection. Twice-weekly saliva samples were collected (a) before initial infection, (b) resumed on day 10 after initial infection until reinfection was detected, and (c) resumed on day 10 post-reinfection. A 1.5-hour virtual interview was conducted, transcribed, and independently analyzed by two researchers. Four themes emerged: (1) perceived invincibility or inevitability and subsequent immunity increases risk of transmission via inconsistent preventive behaviors; (2) normalcy desires, trusted others, and implicit social pressures to not wear masks and distance increase ones coronavirus disease 2019 risk; (3) physical symptoms are more severe with reinfection compared with first infection; and (4) mental health sequelae (trauma and stigma) are more severe and enduring than physical health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Unmasked social interactions contradicting public health recommendations were rationalized by social circle members with heavy reliance on feeling asymptomatic, lacking a positive test (testing negative or not testing), or attributing symptoms to allergies. Stigma of testing positive and consequences of not conforming to social group behaviors is overwhelming and creates pressure to take risks.

Meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.3. Random effects model was used to compute the pooled estimates of odds ratio/mean difference (OR)/(MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Results from the pooled meta-analysis found that CVD, hypertension, AKI, cerebrovascular disease, AKI and ARDS were significantly associated with DM in COVID-19 infected patients compared to non-diabetic patients. There is significant association found between mortality and DM compared to non-diabetic patients [OR (95% CI): 2.46 (1.68, 3.58)].

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2' cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue differences, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Peptide has a Greater Membrane Perturbating Effect than SARS-CoV with Highly Specific Dependence on Ca2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the majority of children as COVID-19, without symptoms or with a paucisymptomatic respiratory syndrome, but a small proportion of children develop the systemic Multi Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), characterized by persistent fever and systemic hyperinflammation, with some clinical features resembling Kawasaki Disease (KD). Objective: With this study we aimed to shed new light on the pathogenesis of these two SARS-CoV-2-related clinical manifestations. Methods: We investigated lymphocyte and dendritic cells subsets, chemokine/cytokine profiles and evaluated the neutrophil activity mediators, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in 10 children with COVID-19 and 9 with MIS-C at the time of hospital admission. Results: Patients with MIS-C showed higher plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), MPO, IL-6, and of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 than COVID-19 children. In addition, they displayed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, mainly induced by IFN-?3. By contrast, we detected IFN-&#945; in plasma of children with COVID-19, but not in patients with MIS-C. This observation was consistent with the increase of ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNAs in cells of COVID-19 patients, while ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA were detected in MIS-C at levels comparable to healthy controls. Moreover, quantification of the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which constitute the main source of IFN-&#945;, showed profound depletion of this subset in MIS-C, but not in COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results show a pattern of immune response which is suggestive of type I interferon activation in COVID-19 children, probably related to a recent interaction with the virus, while in MIS-C the immune response is characterized by elevation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 and of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXL10, which are markers of an active Th1 type immune response. We believe that these immunological events, together with neutrophil activation, might be crucial in inducing the multisystem and cardiovascular damage observed in MIS-C.","output":"Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Depletion and Elevation of IFN-?3 Dependent Chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To summarize the current progress of vascularized bone grafting in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), and to provide reference for treatment of ONFH. Methods The literature at home and abroad on the treatment of ONFH with vascularized bone grafting was reviewed, and the mechanism, operating methods and effectiveness, indications, and complications were summarized. Results Vascularized bone grafting is a commonly used clinical hip-preserving operation. By replacing necrotic bone tissue with vascularized bone, it can rebuild the blood circulation system, promote the healing of the necrotic area, and provide biomechanical support for the necrotic area of the femoral head, prevent the joint surface collapse. The main operations include the vascularized iliac bone flap grafting, the vascularized greater trochanter bone flap grafting, and the vascularized fibular grafting. The clinical application has achieved certain effectiveness, and the different procedures are suitable for different types of patients. The procedures need to be selected based on the patient's overall condition, the cause of ONFH, the necrosis stage, and the degree of the evaluation. Conclusion Vascularized bone grafting has a definite effectiveness in the treatment of ONFH in the young and middle-aged.

However, few studies have focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19. This study conducted a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in mainland China using the web crawler technique to collect anonymous COVID-19 updates published by local health authorities. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children aged 4 days to 14 years with a median age of 7 years were included. Sixty-six percent of pediatric patients were infected via family members with COVID-19. The median incubation period was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 13). Asymptomatic cases accounted for 5.9%, of which 30% had abnormal chest radiologic findings. A majority of pediatric COVID-19 cases showed mild to moderate clinical features, and only a few developed severe or critical diseases (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively). Fever (77.9%) and cough (32.4%) were the predominant presenting symptoms of pediatric COVID-19. The pediatric patients had fewer underlying diseases and complications than adults. The treatment modalities for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those of adult COVID-19 patients. The overall prognosis of pediatric COVID-19 was benign with a decent recovery.

We conducted an overview of systematic reviews, searching 9 electronic databases. Eligible reviews included decisional needs assessments, decision support interventions, and decisional outcome measures guided by the ODSF. We extracted data and synthesized results narratively. Eight ODSF developers/expert users from 4 disciplines revised the ODSF. Results. Of 4656 citations, we identified 4 eligible reviews (>250 studies, >100 different decisions, >50,000 patients, 18 countries, 5 continents). They reported current ODSF decisional needs and their most frequent manifestations in the areas of inadequate knowledge/information, unclear values, decisional conflict/uncertainty, and inadequate support. They uncovered 11 new manifestations of 6 decisional needs. Using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) to assess decisional needs, average scores were elevated at baseline and declined shortly after decision making, even without information interventions. Patient decision aids were superior to usual care in reducing total DCS scores and improving decision quality. We revised the ODSF by refining definitions of 6 decisional needs and adding new interventions to address 4 needs. We added a decision process outcome and eliminated secondary outcomes unlikely to improve across a range of decisions, retaining the implementation/continuance of the chosen option and appropriate use/costs of health services.

Although neuroinflammatory mechanisms may contribute to brain tissue destruction, the induction pathways and potential roles of specific chemokines in TBEV-mediated neurological disease are poorly understood. METHODS: BALB/c mice were intracerebrally injected with TBEV, followed by evaluation of chemokine and cytokine profiles using protein array analysis. The virus-infected mice were treated with the CC chemokine antagonist Met-RANTES or anti-RANTES mAb to determine the role of RANTES in affecting TBEV-induced neurological disease. The underlying signaling mechanisms were delineated using RANTES promoter luciferase reporter assay, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and pharmacological inhibitors in human brain-derived cell culture models. RESULTS: In a mouse model, pathological features including marked inflammatory cell infiltrates were observed in brain sections, which correlated with a robust up-regulation of RANTES within the brain but not in peripheral tissues and sera. Antagonizing RANTES within CNS extended the survival of mice and reduced accumulation of infiltrating cells in the brain after TBEV infection. Through in vitro studies, we show that virus infection up-regulated RANTES production at both mRNA and protein levels in human brain-derived cell lines and primary progenitor-derived astrocytes. Furthermore, IRF-3 pathway appeared to be essential for TBEV-induced RANTES production. Site mutation of an IRF-3-binding motif abrogated the RANTES promoter activity in virus-infected brain cells. Moreover, IRF-3 was activated upon TBEV infection as evidenced by phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF-3, while blockade of IRF-3 activation drastically reduced virus-induced RANTES expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings together provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying RANTES production induced by TBEV, highlighting its potential importance in the process of neuroinflammatory responses to TBEV infection.

Material and method: Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients previously detected as \\"Negative\\" and 21 patients detected as \\"Positive\\" for SARS-CoV-2 was performed with the EasyExtract DNA-RNA kit (Interprise?). The rRT-PCR was performed with the OneStep/COVID-19 kit (IBMP), with normal and diluted (80 l of H2O RNAse free) samples, totaling 82 tests. Results: The results indicate that there is an average variation (a &lt; 0.05) delaying the Cq between the results of amplification of the internal control (IC), N gene (NG), and ORF1ab (OF), 1.811 Cq, 3.840 Cq, and 3.842 Cq, respectively. Discussion: The extraction kit does not completely purify the inhibitor compounds; therefore, no amplified product result may occur. In this study, we obtained a 19.04% false-negative diagnosis after sample dilution; this process reduces the efficiency of rRT-PCR to 29.8% in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Knowing the rRT-PCR standards of diluted samples can assist in the identification of false-negative cases and, consequently, avoid incorrect diagnosis.","output":"False-negative result in molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in samples with amplification inhibitors/ Resultado falso negativo no diagnstico molecular de SARS-CoV-2 em amostras com inibidores de amplifica??o"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SLC transporters are emerging key drug targets. One important step for drug development is the profound understanding of the structural determinants defining the substrate selectivity of each transporter.

Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results of most questions. Two questions comparing the changes in factors influencing the selection of applicants on a Likert scale of 1-5 were analyzed using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test where p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Responses from 125 participants were analyzed. The following factors carried less weight in evaluating applicants during 2021 Match: away rotations (p < 0.01), no failed attempts in USMLE Step 1/CK (p < 0.01), grades in radiology clerkship (p < 0.04), and class rank/quartile (p < 0.04), while personal statements were more important (p < 0.03). Out of the 125 respondents, 80 (64%) and 58 (47%) strongly or somewhat agree on the effectiveness of virtual interviews in gauging applicants' candidacy and showing their programs' advantages, respectively. Advantages of virtual interviews included decreased cost, time flexibility, less faculty burden, and an increased number of offered interviews according to 81% (101/125), 46% (58/125), 40%, (50/125), and 34% (43/125), respectively.

Objectives: To explore the early clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients to improve the diagnostic level of this contagious respiratory disease. Methods: An analysis retrospectively was implemented on the radiological features and clinical characteristics of 12 patients with COVID-19 who had undergone chest CT scanning in the designated hospital from Jan 23, 2020, to Feb 18, 2020. The clinical data on general information, epidemiological, cardinal symptoms, blood test, and CT imaging characteristics were obtained. Results: According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into two groups: mild (2 cases), and ordinary type (10 cases). The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were fever (9/12) and cough (8/12) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. The blood test of the patients showed that most of the white blood cell count was normal (10/12), decreased lymphocyte count (6/12), and increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (5/12). In the early stage of COVID-19, the chest CT images showed patchy mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) (8/12), mainly distributed in the periphery and posterior part of both lungs. The internal density of image lesion area was uneven, and lesions primarily manifested as \\"crazy-paving pattern\\" (8/12), with grid-like, interlobular septal thickening, thickened bronchovascular bundle and air bronchus sign and multiple fibrosis. A few cases showed pulmonary atelectasis (1/12), bilateral pleural effusion (1/12), no mediastinal or bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. The chest CT images may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","output":"Analyzing the early ct findings and clinical features of 12 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in china"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human aminopeptidase N (hAPN/hCD13) is a dimeric membrane protein and a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases.

To understand the cellular basis of this antiviral effect, we studied the possible involvement of arginine metabolism through nitric oxide (NO) and arginase induction, since these metabolic pathways have been described as implicated in antiviral activities of macrophages. The studies were performed by activating macrophages with inducers of NO (IFN gamma) and arginase (IL4 IL10). NO synthase (iNOS) and arginase inhibitors (N-methyl-arginine, NMA, and hydroxyarginine, OH-ARG) were used. The results show that in both macrophage populations, no spontaneous synthesis of NO occurred and the MHV3 enhanced the NO release induced by IFN gamma. After activation with IFN gamma, BALB/c macrophages released higher amounts of NO than the A/J macrophages. The inhibition of IFN gamma-induced NO-synthesis with NMA or with arginine free medium did not affect the virus replication. In BALB/c macrophages, IL4 or IL10, induced higher amounts of arginase than in A/J macrophages. In both macrophage populations the MHV3 infection had no influence on the arginase synthesized, and the inhibition of the arginase with OH-ARG had no influence on the virus growth. The level of MHV3 replication or inhibition was also not influenced when we used macrophages from knockout mice for the iNOS gene, and as a consequence were unable of synthesizing NO.

METHODS The electronic medical record was queried for 30-day outcomes (readmission and emergency department visits with associated indications) for all cases performed between June 2010 and August 2020 by a single FPMRS surgeon. Non-FPMRS specialty cases were excluded. Patient characteristics and 30-day outcomes were compared based on SDD status for the overall cohort as well as the subset of cases traditionally involving an overnight stay (i.e., robotic transabdominal, apical prolapse repair). RESULTS 1793 surgeries were identified and analyzed, including 357 apical prolapse repairs, 370 slings, 392 neuromodulation and 114 complex mesh excisions. The majority (79.1%) had SDD. For admitted patients, mean length of stay was 1.5 (1.3) days. Among cases traditionally involving overnight stay, rates of SDD were significantly higher in 2020 than 2010 (84% vs. 32%, p < 0.001), and increased over time.

These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented COVID-19-related symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in an electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and nonbiomedical domains, and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, it's unclear how useful openly available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19-related concepts. OBJECTIVE: Given an initial lexicon of COVID-19-related terms, this study aims to characterize the returned terms by similarity across various open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to the word embedding source. METHODS: We compared seven openly available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19-related terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an interannotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to detect informative patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such learned synonyms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept among three patient cohorts: pneumonia (n=6410), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=8647), and COVID-19 (n=2397). RESULTS: We observed high pairwise interannotator agreement (Cohen kappa) for symptoms (0.86-0.99), findings (0.93-0.99), and disorders (0.93-0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more synonyms (mean count of 7.2 synonyms) compared to token-based embedding sources (mean counts range from 2.0 to 3.4). Word embedding sources queried using a qualifier term (eg, dry cough or muscle pain) more often returned qualifiers of the similar semantic type (eg, \\"dry\\" returns consistency qualifiers like \\"wet\\" and \\"runny\\") compared to a single term (eg, cough or pain) queries. A higher proportion of patients had documented fever (0.61-0.84), cough (0.41-0.55), shortness of breath (0.40-0.59), and hypoxia (0.51-0.56) retrieved than other clinical features. Terms for dry cough returned a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 (0.07) than the pneumonia (0.05) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (0.03) populations. CONCLUSIONS: Word embeddings are valuable technology for learning related terms, including synonyms.

However, among different physicians and specifically plastic surgeons, cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of their cases are semi-elective and elective. The ability to perform semi-elective and elective cases is dependent on state and local authorities' regulations, and it is currently uncertain when the ban, if ever, will be completely lifted.

Identifying COVID-19 positive patients who were high-risk for severe illness early in their course could have assisted in determining the most appropriate medical management in many cases. Currently, few models exist to predict the outcome of COVID-19 positive patients. Among those that do, none to our knowledge utilize Bayesian logistic regression. The goal of this study was to generate a model that would dynamically estimate the probability of severe disease in patients who test positive for COVID-19 during their initial emergency department (ED) visit. Methods: This model initially utilized a Bayesian approach with prior data based on the literature at the time, and after one week employed logistical regression using retrospective data from our own patient set. In total, data from 428 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented between March 4th and May 7th of 2020 was incorporated. Priors included: female sex, O2 Saturation, lymphocytes, LDH, and CRP. Data acquired during the patients encounter included co-morbidities, temperature, MAP, HR, ferritin, d-dimer, hs-troponin, platelets, total bilirubin, hgb, lactate, albumin, and SOFA score. Single imputation was utilized to address patients with missing data points. Our primary outcomes were vasopressor requirement, intubation, and death.

MethodsWe performed a systematic search of seven electronic databases. The search results were screened based on the previously determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We determined the data related to our objectives. The mortality rates, rates of hospitalization, risk of mechanical ventilation and serious side effects were extracted from the studies that successfully met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, the extracted data from the included studies was included in the meta-analysis. ResultsThree studies, two randomized clinical trials and one observational cohort study, with 1762 patients, were the final outcome of our search and screening processes. Among all participants, 886 patients received Fluvoxamine while 876 were controls. Follow up periods ranged from 7 days to 28 days. There was no significant difference in the intention-to-treat mortality rates between the two groups (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.21, p-value = 0.18; I2 = 0%). However, Fluvoxamine decreased the per-protocol mortality compared to both placebo alone or placebo/standard care (RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.64, p-value = 0.02; I2 = 0% and RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.72, respectively). As compared to placebo or standard care, the all-cause hospitalization was significantly reduced in the fluvoxamine group (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54 - 0.93, p-value = 0.01; I2 = 61%). This risk reduction was not significant when compared to placebo alone (RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 - 1.00; p-value = 0.051; I2 = 48%). Furthermore, the risk of mechanical ventilation was not improved in the fluvoxamine group as compared to placebo (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.16, p-value = 0.17; I2 = 0%). The serious adverse effects were almost the same in the treatment group and the control (13% and 12% respectively). ConclusionFluvoxamine does not significantly reduce the mortality rates or the risk of mechanical ventilation in SARS CoV-2 patients.

RESULTS: Of these patients, 211 (40.3%) were admitted to the ICU and 115 deaths (22.0%). Patients admitted to the ICU had lower BMI and plasma protein levels. The median Nutrition risk in critically ill (NUTRIC) score of 211 patients in the ICU was 5 (4, 6) and Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) score was 5 (3, 6). The ratio of parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy in non-survivors was greater than that in survivors, and the time to start nutrition therapy was later than that in survivors. The NUTRIC score can independently predict the risk of death in the hospital (OR = 1.197, 95%CI: 1.091-1.445, p = 0.006) and high NRS score patients have a higher risk of poor outcome in the ICU (OR = 1.880, 95%CI: 1.151-3.070, p = 0.012).

We first isolated E. coli into individual droplets containing a DNAzyme mixture using droplet microfluidics. Upon bacterial cell lysis by heating, the DNAzyme mixture reacted with a particular substrate present in the crude intracellular material (CIM) of E. coli. This event triggers the dissociation of the fluorophore-quencher pair present in the DNAzyme mixture leading to a fluorescence signal, indicating the presence of E. coli in the droplets. We developed an algorithm using computer vision to analyze the fluorescent droplets containing E. coli in the presence of non-fluorescent droplets. The algorithm can detect and count fluorescent droplets representing the number of E. coli present in the sample. Finally, we show that the developed method is highly specific to detect and count E. coli in the presence of other bacteria present in the water sample.","output":"Digital E. coli Counter: A Microfluidics and Computer Vision-Based DNAzyme Method for the Isolation and Specific Detection of E. coli from Water Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective As critical illness and critical care lack consensus definitions, this study aims to explore how the concepts are used, describe their defining attributes and propose potential definitions. Design We used the Walker and Avant stepwise approach to concept analysis. The uses and definitions of the concepts were identified through a scoping review of the literature and an online survey of 114 global clinical experts. Through content analysis of the data we extracted codes, categories and themes to determine the concepts defining attributes and we proposed potential definitions. To assist understanding, we present model, related and contrary cases concerning the concepts, we identified antecedents and consequences to the concepts, and defined empirical referents. Results The defining attributes of critical illness were a high risk of imminent death; vital organ dysfunction; requirement for care to avoid death; and potential reversibility. The defining attributes of critical care were the identification, monitoring and treatment of critical illness; vital organ support; initial and sustained care; any care of critical illness; and specialized human and physical resources. Our proposed definition of critical illness is, a state of ill health with vital organ dysfunction, a high risk of imminent death if care is not provided and the potential for reversibility. Our proposed definition of critical care is, the identification, monitoring and treatment of patients with critical illness through the initial and sustained support of vital organ functions. Conclusion The concepts critical illness and critical care lack consensus definitions and have varied uses. Through concept analysis of uses and definitions in the literature and among experts we have identified the defining attributes of the concepts and propose definitions that could aid clinical practice, research, and policy making.","output":"Towards definitions of critical illness and critical care using concept analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: CD4 count is an important predictor of disease progression, opportunities infection, deaths, and to understand the time interval between initial HIV infection to the first diagnosis. However, baseline CD4 count and the time period between initial infection and the diagnosis amongst PLHIV in Bhutan never been evaluated. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the diagnosed PLHIV from the existing data system from January 10 to 30, 2021. Out of 512 reported HIV cases, 488 of those who were more than or equal to 18 years old and had their CD4 count testing within 6 months before initiating ART were considered for analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of the study population and relationship were established using the  (2) Test. We have sought ethics approval and waiver for informed consent as it is the retrospective study of the client's record. The client's confidentiality was ensured by removing all the identifiers. RESULTS: The mean CD4 was 345 cells/ml for males and females. Twenty\\\\five percent of the clients had CD4 counts below 200, 30%, between 200 and 349, 25% between 350 and 499, and 20% above 500 cells/ml. A larger number of males showed a CD4 count below 200 cells/ml while more females showed a CD4 count more than 500 cells/ml. The mean time interval between initial infection to the first diagnosis was 4 years in males and females. However, about one\\\\fourth were found to have been infected between 5 and 8 years before diagnosis and less than 10% were diagnosed within less than 1 year of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a late diagnosis of HIV infection in Bhutan thereby risking the transmission to the community and risk of severe disease and mortality. The upscaling of voluntary counseling and testing, medical screening, and alternative methods like community\\\\based testing including HIV Self Testing for early detection needs to be implemented in the country.","output":"Baseline CD4 count and the time interval between the initial HIV infection and diagnosis among PLHIV in Bhutan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has found a positive association between social class and mental health among university students.

All participants, regardless of group, had received the intervention, a treatment app, at the long-term follow-up. Long-term data were collected through web-based questionnaires 15 months after participants received the intervention. The app included pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, psychoeducation, lifestyle advice, an exercise log, reminders, reinforcement messages, and tailored advice. The primary outcome was a change in incontinence symptoms (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire [ICIQ]-Urinary Incontinence Short Form [ICIQ-UI SF]), from baseline to follow-up. Other outcomes were urgency symptoms (ICIQ-Overactive Bladder Module (ICIQ-OAB)), quality of life (ICIQ-Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module [ICIQ-LUTSqol]), and improvement (Patient's Global Impression of Improvement [PGI-I]).

The predominant approaches developed use PCR to detect viral nucleic acids or immunoassays to detect viral proteins. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages, but alternatives that do not share the same limitations could enable substantial improvements in outbreak detection and management. For instance, methods that have comparable sensitivity to PCR, but that are not prone to the false-positive results that stem from the tendency of PCR to detect molecular degradation products could improve accurate identification of infected individuals. An alternative approach with potential to achieve this entails harnessing the unique enzymatic properties of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes to generate SARS-Cov-2-specific signals that indicate the presence of the virus. This route benefits from the high sensitivity provided by enzymatic signal amplification and also the fact that signal is generated only by intact viral enzymes, not degradation products. Here, we demonstrate enzymatic reaction conditions that enable the preferential detection of NendoU of SARS-CoV-2, versus several of its orthologues, with a fluorogenic oligonucleotide substrate.

Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle.

Recent observational and clinical studies suggest famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor (H2R) antagonist widely used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, attenuates the clinical course of COVID-19. Because evidence is lacking for a direct antiviral activity of famotidine, a proposed mechanism of action is blocking the effects of histamine released by mast cells. Here we hypothesized that famotidine activates the inflammatory reflex, a brain-integrated vagus nerve mechanism which inhibits inflammation via alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) signal transduction, to prevent cytokine storm. METHODS: The potential anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine and other H2R antagonists were assessed in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine storm. As the inflammatory reflex is integrated and can be stimulated in the brain, and H2R antagonists penetrate the blood brain barrier poorly, famotidine was administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. RESULTS: Famotidine administered IP significantly reduced serum and splenic LPS-stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 concentrations, significantly improving survival. The effects of ICV famotidine were significantly more potent as compared to the peripheral route. Mice lacking mast cells by genetic deletion also responded to famotidine, indicating the anti-inflammatory effects are not mast cell-dependent. Either bilateral sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy or genetic knock-out of 7nAChR abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine, indicating the inflammatory reflex as famotidines mechanism of action. While the structurally similar H2R antagonist tiotidine displayed equivalent anti-inflammatory activity, the H2R antagonists cimetidine or ranitidine were ineffective even at very high dosages. CONCLUSIONS: These observations reveal a previously unidentified vagus nerve-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of famotidine in the setting of cytokine storm which is not replicated by high dosages of other H2R antagonists in clinical use. Because famotidine is more potent when administered intrathecally, these findings are also consistent with a primarily central nervous system mechanism of action.

We descriptively examine the turnover trends in nurse employees and all employees over time by profit status. We evaluate whether profit status is associated with high turnover using pooled linear regressions controlling for nursing home and resident characteristics.

Extensive intraoperative blood loss is a major risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality and receipt of blood transfusion is associated with serious risks including an association with long-term cancer recurrence and overall survival. In addition, blood products are scarce and associated with appreciable expense; decreasing blood transfusion requirements would therefore have health system benefits. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic, has been shown to reduce the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by one-third for patients undergoing cardiac or orthopaedic surgery. However, its applicability in liver resection has not been widely researched. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a prospective, blinded, randomised controlled trial being conducted at 10 sites in Canada and 1 in the USA. 1230 eligible and consenting participants will be randomised to one of two parallel groups: experimental (2 g of intravenous TXA) or placebo (saline) administered intraoperatively. The primary endpoint is receipt of blood transfusion within 7 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes include blood loss, postoperative complications, quality of life and 5-year disease-free and overall survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the research ethics boards at participating centres and Health Canada (parent control number 177992) and is currently enrolling participants. All participants will provide written informed consent. Results will be distributed widely through local and international meetings, presentation, publication and ClinicalTrials.gov.

For the tourism industry there are direct consequences for the national and local restrictions that have a direct impact on people's lives to minimize the spread of the virus. There are human mobility and the possibility of direct physical contact between individuals. Several things that are considered by tourists in making travel decisions including the risk perception and their travellings safety to a destination. There are several risk perceptions, namely the financial risk perception time risk social-psychological risk and health risk. Hypothesis using SEM AMOS to majority 16-25 years old respondents found no direct influence between perceived risk and intention to travel. The results showed that an increase in risk perception did not affect a decrease in travel intention. Among the 4 variables tested perceptions of financial risk have the greatest influence followed by perceptions of health risk, social-psychological risk, and time risk.

We sought to examine cancer care providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the care for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages through social media. RESULTS: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4% had access to written guidelines that specifically address the management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status. Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-, healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3%) that decision making about Do Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays, healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for family and self.

Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2-3-fold that manifested in a 2-3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus genome.","output":"RNA virus population diversity, an optimum for maximal fitness and virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using air quality monitoring data, surface meteorological observational data, meteorological environment assessment index (EMI-index) products, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data and output of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to Chemistry (WRF-Chem) from 2015 to 2020 in Shenyang, we analyzed the variation of criteria air pollutants and meteorological elements in Shenyang during the epidemic of COVID-19 and evaluated the response of air quality to emission reduction and meteorological conditions. The results showed that mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in Shenyang during the epidemic of COVID-19 decreased, while O3 concentration slightly increased. PM2.5 and NO2 were more sensitive to anthropogenic emission reduction.

Recent investigations implied that the pleiotropic effects of MSCs is not associated to their ability of differentiation, but rather is mediated by the secretion of soluble paracrine factors. Exosomes, nanoscale extracellular vesicles, are one of these paracrine mediators. Exosomes transfer functional cargos like miRNA and mRNA molecules, peptides, proteins, cytokines and lipids from MSCs to the recipient cells. Exosomes participate in intercellular communication events and contribute to the healing of injured or diseased tissues and organs. Studies reported that exosomes alone are responsible for the therapeutic effects of MSCs in numerous experimental models. Therefore, MSC-derived exosomes can be manipulated and applied to establish a novel cell-free therapeutic approach for treatment of a variety of diseases including heart, kidney, liver, immune and neurological diseases, and cutaneous wound healing. In comparison with their donor cells, MSC-derived exosomes offer more stable entities and diminished safety risks regarding the administration of live cells, e.g. microvasculature occlusion risk.

Participants were asked to attend to a 75 minute educational video lecture, while task-irrelevant auditory tones played at random intervals. The tones were of two distinct pitches, with one occurring frequently (80%) and the other infrequently (20%). Participants were prompted at pseudo-random intervals during the lecture to report their degree of experienced mind wandering. EEG spectral power and event-related potentials (ERP) were compared between states of high and low degrees of self-reported mind wandering. Participants also performed pre/post quizzes based on the lecture material. Results revealed significantly higher delta, theta and alpha band activity during mind wandering, as well as a decreased P2 ERP amplitude. Further, learning scores (improvement on quizzes pre to post) were lower among participants who reported higher degrees of mind wandering throughout the video.

The effect of SD intrusions on PM and the respective major and trace metals mass concentrations and size distributions was investigated in a suburban site in Athens, Greece. SD events were associated, on average, with lower boundary layer heights (BLH) compared to the non-Sahara (nSD) dust days. During SD events, PM1-10 concentrations showed an increasing trend with increasing atmospheric BLH, in contrary to the fine PM (PM1). Generally, increased PM1 and CO (i.e. anthropogenic origin) levels were observed for BLH lower than around 500a?m. The average contribution of SD to PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentration was roughly equal to 31% and 19%, respectively. The mass size distributions of PM and specific major and trace elements (Na, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, and Zn) displayed a somewhat different behavior with respect to the mass origin (Algeria-Tunisia vs Libya-Egypt), affecting in turn the regional deposition of inhaled aerosol in the human respiratory tract (HRT). The average PM deposited mass in the upper and lower HRT was 80.1% (Head) and 26.9% (Lung; Tracheobronchial and Pulmonary region) higher for SD days than for nSD days. Higher doses were estimated in the upper and lower HRT for the majority of the elements, when SD intrusions occurred, supporting the increasingly growing interest in exploring the health effects of SD.

Risk of bias was assessed qualitatively, considering costing approach, reported study perspective, and funding received. Intervention costs were adjusted to 2021 US dollars for comparison. For studies reporting quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), we conducted analyses stratified by comparison type to assess cost effectiveness at the time of the analysis. RESULTS A total of 27 studies were included. Non-curative versus non-curative therapy comparisons were used in 20 (74.1%) studies, curative versus curative comparisons were used in 5 (18.5%) studies, and curative versus non-curative comparisons were used in 2 (7.4%) studies. Therapy effectiveness was estimated using a QALY measure in 20 (74.1%) studies, while 7 (25.9%) studies only assessed life-years gained (LYG). A health sector perspective was used in 26 (96.3%) of the evaluations, with only 1 study including costs beyond this perspective. Median intervention cost was $53,954 (range $4550-$4,760,835), with a median incremental cost of $6546 (range - $72,441 to $1,279,764).

This review places VA-ECMO and Impella support strategies in the context of bridging patients to successful PIVSR repair, with an additional case report of successful bridging with the Impella device. Materials and Methods: We report a case of PIVSR repair utilizing 14 days of Impella support. We additionally conducted a systematic review of contemporary literature to describe the application of VA-ECMO and Impella devices in the pre-operative period prior to surgical PIVSR correction. Expert commentary on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques is provided. Results: We identified 19 studies with 72 patients undergoing VA-ECMO as a bridge to PIVSR repair and 6 studies with 11 patients utilizing an Impella device as a bridge to PIVSR repair. Overall, outcomes in both groups were better than expected from patients who were historically managed with medicine and balloon pump therapy, however there was a significant heterogeneity between studies. Impella provided for excellent left ventricular unloading, but did result in some concerns for reversal of shunting. VA-ECMO resulted in improved end-organ perfusion, but carried increased risks of device-related complications and requirement for additional ventricular unloading. Conclusions: Patients presenting with PIVSR in cardiogenic shock requiring a MCS bridge to definitive surgical repair continue to pose a challenge to the multidisciplinary cardiovascular team as the diverse presentation and management issues require individualized care plans. Both VA-ECMO and the Impella family of devices play a role in the contemporary management of PIVSR and offer distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the clinical scenario.

To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","output":"Ameliorating the Accuracy & Dimensional Reduction of Multi-modal Biometrics by Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a source of new pressure on the US intelligence community to generate tendentious intelligence","output":"CIA Agonistes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The evidence pertaining to the effects of asthma on Coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes has been unclear. To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age [] 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. Results: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.

The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males < females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone/low prenatal estrogen). AIM: To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. STUDY DESIGN: COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). SUBJECTS: 103,482 men and 83,366 women. OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. RESULTS: Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. CONCLUSIONS: At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone/high prenatal estrogen) is associated with high CFRs and percent male mortality. At the individual level, high 2D:4D may be a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 in males.

This includes younger, often nulliparous, women; however, uptake has been relatively low in this group. METHODS In February 2017 we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies to identify barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women. RESULTS Study quality was poor. No differences in rates of infection or expulsions between nulliparous and parous were seen. Fertility rates following removal appeared no different from the general population. Higher rates insertion difficulty, insertion failure and pain during insertion were observed in nulliparous women. CONCLUSION A long-acting reversible contraceptive method such as IUC reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy since user failure is minimised. Evidence-based information about the advantages and disadvantages of IUC is required to inform decision-making and dispel any myths and misperceptions. Potential barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women, particularly concerns around infection, significantly higher rates of device expulsion and adverse effects on fertility, do not appear to be justified. IUC is appropriate for all medically-eligible women, including nulliparous women, and should be included in the range of contraceptive options discussed during counselling.","output":"Safety of insertion of the copper IUD and LNG-IUS in nulliparous women: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presence of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), both in genic and intergenic regions, have been widely studied in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses.

We successfully identified 919 SSRs with length12 bp across 55 reference genomes majority of which (838 S SRs) were found abundant in genic regions. The in-silico analysis further identified the preferential abundance of hexameric SSRs than any other size-based motif class. Our analysis shows that the genome size and GC content of the genome had a weak influence on SSR frequency and density. However, we find a positive correlation of SSRs GC content with genomic GC content. We also report relatively low abundances of all theoretically possible 501 repeat motif classes in all the genomes of Coronaviridae. The majority of SSRs were AT-rich. Overall, we see an underrepresentation of SSRs across the genomes of Coronaviridae.

The study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic at St. Paul's Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional study was conducted to collect socio-demographic information and symptoms of mental disorders using validated measurement tools. Accordingly, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R were used to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Chi-square test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect risk factors for common mental disorders. RESULTS: A total of 420 healthcare workers participated in the survey. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress was 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% respectively. Frontline HCWs had higher scores of mental health symptoms than non-frontline healthcare workers. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that being married was associated with a high level of depression. Furthermore, working in a frontline position was an independent risk factor associated with a high-level of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. LIMITATIONS: It is a single-center cross-sectional study and the findings may not be nationally representative or reveal causality. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of healthcare workers are suffering from symptoms of mental disorders. Frontline HCWs were at a greater risk of severe symptoms.

Since poly(amino acid)s are built from natural amino acids, the same building blocks proteins are made of, they are biocompatible, biodegradable and their degradation products are metabolizable. Some amino acids display a unique asymmetrical AB2 structure, which facilitates their ability to form branched structures. This review compares the three forms of highly branched polymeric structures: structurally highly organized dendrimers, dendrigrafts and the less organized, but readily synthesizable hyperbranched polymers. Their syntheses are reviewed and compared, methods of synthesis modulations are considered and variations on their traditional syntheses are shown. The potential use of highly branched polymers in the realm of biomedical applications is discussed, specifically their applications as delivery vehicles for genes and drugs and their use as antiviral compounds. Of the twenty essential amino acids, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid, and L-aspartic acid are asymmetrical AB2 molecules, but the bulk of the research into highly branched poly(amino acid)s has focused on the polycationic poly(L-lysine) with a lesser extent on poly(L-glutamic acid). Hence, the majority of potential applications lies in delivery systems for nucleic acids and this review examines and compares how these three types of highly branched polymers function as non-viral gene delivery vectors. When considering drug delivery systems, the small size of these highly branched polymers is advantageous for the delivery of inhalable drug. Even though highly branched polymers, in particular dendrimers, have been studied for more than 40 years for the delivery of genes and drugs, they have not translated in large scale into the clinic except for promising antiviral applications that have been commercialized.","output":"Highly Branched Polymers Based on Poly(amino acid)s for Biomedical Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with multisystem signs and symptoms, including dermatologic manifestations.

The secondary aim was to analyze the potential influence of FIRS on cerebral injury and mortality. Methods: Secondary outcome parameters of prospective observational studies were analyzed. Preterm neonates with measured IL-6 values from umbilical cord blood and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements during immediate transition after birth were included. Preterm neonates with FIRS (FIRS group) were matched 1:1 for gestational age ( 1 week) to preterm neonates without FIRS (non-FIRS group). crSO2, cFTOE, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were compared between both groups. In addition, cerebral injury and mortality were compared between both groups. Results: A total of 46 preterm neonates were included. Twenty-three neonates in the FIRS group [median gestational age 32.1 (IQR 30.3-33.0) weeks; median IL-6 19.7 (IQR 12.2-37.0) pg/ml] were compared to 23 neonates in the non-FIRS group [gestational age: 32.0 (30.4-33.1) weeks; IL-6: 5.4 (3.0-6.7) pg/ml]. cFTOE showed significantly lower values within the first 4 min and a trend toward lower values in minute 5 after birth in the FIRS group.

Survival without cerebral injury was similar in both groups. Conclusion: In preterm neonates with FIRS the crSO2 was similar despite significantly lower cFTOE values during the first minutes after birth.

DESIGN: Retrospective case controlled, based on consecutive patients transferred and admitted from rural hospitals to a tertiary-care ICU. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used in the survival data analysis. SETTING: Medical ICU, West Virginia University Hospital, Morgantown, WV. PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted to the ICU for coronavirus disease 2019 disease between September 30, 2020, and December 2, 2020. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-nine consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients were admitted to the ICU during the defined period. Overall mortality of the cohort was 54%. Of the 79 patients, 50 were transferred from critical access hospitals/rural facilities with coronavirus disease 2019Cinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome. A control group consisted of 39 patients admitted to the ICU with noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome who were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Thirty-day mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU was significantly higher than the control group (68% vs 42%) (p = 0.034). Mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar in both coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome group and controls. Intubation in patients 70 years or older and mechanical ventilation for over 5 days was associated with significantly higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data on critically ill and mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients transferred from critical access hospitals/rural facilities have increased mortality compared with noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome controls.

To date, a majority of studies assessing sensory-dependent plasticity have focused on effects from either early onset or long-term sensory loss and little is known how the recent sensory loss affects the human brain. With the aim of determining how recent sensory loss affects cerebral morphology and functional connectivity, we assessed differences between individuals with acquired olfactory loss (duration 7-36 months, n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=23) in their grey matter volume, using multivariate pattern analyses, and functional connectivity, using dynamic connectivity analyses, within and from the olfactory cortex. Our results demonstrate that acquired olfactory loss alters grey matter volume in, among others, posterior piriform cortex, a core olfactory processing area, as well as the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus. In addition, compared to controls, individuals with acquired anosmia displayed significantly stronger dynamic functional connectivity from the posterior piriform cortex to, among others, the angular gyrus, a known multisensory integration area. No significantly stronger connectivity in healthy control participants were demonstrated. When assessing differences in dynamic functional connectivity from the angular gyrus, individuals with acquired anosmia had stronger connectivity from the angular gyrus to areas primary responsible for basic visual and taste processing. These results demonstrate that recently acquired sensory loss alters both cerebral morphology within core olfactory areas and increase dynamic functional connectivity from olfactory cortex to cerebral areas processing multisensory integration.","output":"Acquired olfactory loss alters functional connectivity and morphology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The increase of healthcare digitalization comes along with potential information security risks.

We present a patient with lymphoma who had a very prolonged and ultimately fatal course of COVID-19 despite aggressive treatments. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old male was diagnosed with aggressive follicular lymphoma and received standard chemotherapy. Two years later, his disease recurs with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and received Rituximab, Dexamethasone, Cytarabine, and Oxaliplatin and radiotherapy to T8-T10 for chord compression. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was planned but deferred because he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab RT-PCR. Over the next 12 months, he required hospitalization 7 times with fever, cough, progressive dyspnea, and diffuse lung opacities on chest radiograph. Chest CT revealed bilateral diffuse ground glass infiltrates. Bronchoscopy with BAL was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR;lung biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonitis but negative for other infectious pathogens. Overtime, he tested 6 times positive and 2 times negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. He was treated with antimicrobials, convalescent plasma, Remdesivir, and corticosteroids. Cytoxan was subsequently added as a steroid sparing agent. He had 3 negative and 2 positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology tests. On this last admission, he presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. IL-6 levels peaked at 244. The cycle threshold (CT) values were in the teens suspicious of active viral replication. In ICU he was treated with proned positioning and received vasopressors, Remdesivir, and another course of IV corticosteroids. A year from the COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient's family decided to focus care on comfort, and he expired. DISCUSSION: Per our knowledge we are describing the longest case that suffered with COVID 19. He had a slowly progressive disease and inconsistent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Our case highlights the challenges in managing lymphoma patients, who due to B-cell dysfunction and treatment depletion of B-cells, may act as persistent shedders and sources of transmission. They harbor dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and have an increased likelihood of virally induced lymphopenia and high mortality. The efficacy of corticosteroids and IL-6 receptor inhibitors to treat COVID-19 in patients with lymphoma is unknown. Although these treatments may be helpful in suppressing the 'cytokine storm', they can impede viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that regular viral load testing and prolonged courses of antiviral therapies and use of convalescent plasma may need to be considered in patients with lymphoma and protracted COVID-19.

As a first step toward understanding the effect of PDCoV on host cells, we elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after PDCoV infection. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of PDCoV-induced apoptosis and reduction of PDCoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, PDCoV infection necessitated the activation of the initiator caspase-9 responsible for the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Experimental data indicated that PDCoV infection led to Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in specific relocation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c) into the cytoplasm. Treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, significantly suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and viral replication. Moreover, cyt c release was completely abrogated in PDCoV-infected cells in the presence of CsA, suggesting the critical role of MPTP in intrinsic apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that PDCoV infection stimulates MOMP either via Bax recruitment or MPTP opening to permit the release of apoptogenic cyt c into the cytoplasm, thereby leading to execution of the caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway to facilitate viral replication in vitro.","output":"Porcine deltacoronavirus induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo understand how individuals make trade-offs between features of lockdown interventions to control a pandemic across the four nations of the United Kingdom.

SettingNation-wide survey across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Representative sample in terms of age and sex for each of the nations recruited using an online panel between 29th October and 12th December 2020. ParticipantsIndividuals who are over 18 years old. A total of 4120 adults completed the survey (1112 in England, 848 in Northern Ireland, 1143 in Scotland and 1098 in Wales). Primary outcome measureAdults preferences for, and trade-offs between, type of lockdown restrictions, length of lockdown, postponement of routine healthcare, excess deaths, impact on ability to buy things and unemployment. ResultsIn all four countries, one out of five respondents were willing to reduce excess deaths at all costs. The majority of adults are willing to accept higher excess deaths if this means lockdowns that are less strict, shorter and do not postpone routine healthcare. On average, respondents in England were willing to accept a higher increase in excess deaths to have less strict lockdown restrictions introduced compared to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, respectively. ConclusionsThe majority of the UK population is willing to accept the increase in excess deaths associated with introducing less strict lockdown restrictions. The acceptability of different restriction scenarios varies according to the features of the lockdown and across countries. Authorities can use information about trade-off preferences to inform the introduction of different lockdown restriction levels, and design compensation policies that maximise societal welfare.

The large group of multidrug-resistant bacteria includes carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB), for which limited therapeutic options and infection control measures are available. Furthermore, carbapenemases associate with high-risk clones that are defined by the sequence type (ST) to which each bacterium belongs. The objectives of this cross-sectional and retrospective study were to describe the CPB population isolated in a third-level hospital in Southern Spain between 2015 and 2020 and to establish the relationship between the ST and the epidemiological situation defined by the hospital. CPB were microbiologically studied in all rectal and pharyngeal swabs and clinical samples received between January 2015 and December 2020, characterizing isolates using MicroScan and mass spectrometry. Carbapenemases were detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing, and STs were assigned by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were genetically related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using Xbal, Spel, or Apal enzymes. The episodes in which each CPB was isolated were recorded and classified as involved or non-involved in an outbreak. There were 320 episodes with CPB during the study period: 18 with K. pneumoniae, 14 with Klebisella oxytoca, 9 with Citrobacter freundii, 11 with Escherichia coli, 46 with Enterobacter cloacae, 70 with Acinetobacter baumannii, and 52 with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The carbapenemase groups detected were OXA, VIM, KPC, and NDM with various subgroups. Synchronous relationships were notified between episodes of K. pneumoniae and outbreaks for ST15, ST258, ST307, and ST45, but not for the other CPB. There was a major increase in infections with CPB over the years, most notably during 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the usefulness of gene sequencing techniques to control the spread of these microorganisms, especially in healthcare centers. These techniques offer faster results, and a reduction in their cost may make their real-time application more feasible. The combination of epidemiological data with real-time molecular sequencing techniques can provide a major advance in the transmission control of these CPB and in the management of infected patients. Real-time sequencing is essential to increase precision and thereby control outbreaks and target infection prevention measures in a more effective manner.","output":"A Study in a Regional Hospital of a Mid-Sized Spanish City Indicates a Major Increase in Infection/Colonization by Carbapenem-Resistant Bacteria, Coinciding with the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In response to COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) converted appropriate outpatient visits to virtual care, including MOVE!

We sought to describe national trends in MOVE! participation during the pandemic (March 2020CJanuary 2021) overall and by modality and to compare participation to prepandemic levels. METHODS: We conducted a national retrospective cohort study of veterans who participated in MOVE! from January 2018 through January 2021. We examined MOVE! participation across VHA aggregated at the national level by month, including the number of visits, participants, and new participants in person and via telehealth, including telephone, clinic-to-clinic synchronous video, anywhere-to-anywhere (eg, provider home to patient home) synchronous video, and remote education and monitoring. We also determined the percentage of all MOVE! visits attributable to each modality and the monthly percentage change in participation during the pandemic compared with monthly averages in prior years. RESULTS: Before March 2020, 20% to 30% of MOVE! was delivered via telehealth, which increased to 90% by April 2020. Early in the pandemic, telephone-delivered MOVE! was the most common modality, but anywhere-to-anywhere synchronous video participation increased over time. Compared with the same months in prior years, total monthly MOVE! participation remained 20% to 40% lower at the end of 2020 and into January 2021.

Analysis of chest X-ray findings in the first few months after the disease is the main goal of our work. Methods Out of the total of 343 patients chest X-ray findings were followed in 269 patients. Patients were divided into groups according to the severity of findings. D-dimer, inflammatory markers, blood cell count, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were analysed. Chest X-ray was analysed during the hospitalization on the day of admission, on the third, the seventh and the fourteenth day (scoring method was used). After discharge chest X-ray was performed in a two-week follow-up, then after one and two months, and after three months if necessary. Results Incomplete chest X-ray resolution was identified in 24 (39.34%) patients with severe, 27 (22.31 %) patients with moderate and in three (3.91%) patients with mild findings. Statistical significance was established in overall score by comparison between all groups (p<0.001), and in the moderate compared to the mild group (p=0.0051). The difference of NLR in the severe compared to the moderate group was observed (p=0.0021) and in the severe group compared to the mild group (p=0.00013).

The increase was mostly due to calls from patients with respiratory symptoms. Call handlers must rapidly decide whether patients need an emergency face-to-face assessment or could access non-emergency services.We assess accuracy of emergency telephone triage in identifying patients with suspected COVID-19 infection who need an ambulance response and identify factors which affect triage accuracy.Methods/DesignAn observational cohort study of adults who contacted 999 emergency telephone services provided by Yorkshire Ambulance Service between the 18thMarch 2020 and 29th June 2020 with symptoms indicating possible COVID-19 infection was completed. Callers were linked to ONS death registrations and routine health care data collected by NHS Digital.The accuracy of triage outcome (ambulance dispatch versus telephone advice) was assessed for death or organ support 30 days from first contact. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with risk of false negative or false positive triage.Results/ConclusionsOf the 12, 655 callers, 11.1% experienced the primary outcomes. An ambulance was dispatched to 84.2% of callers. The decision to dispatch an ambulance achieved 95% sensitivity (95% CI: 93.7 to 96.1%) and 17.2% specificity (95% 16.5% to 17.9%) for adverse outcomes. Where an ambulance was not dispatched, patients had a 3.5% (2.8 to 4.4%) of subsequent deterioration. Of patients that received an ambulance only 57% were subsequently conveyed to hospital. Multivariable logistic regression modelling found false negative assessment was associated with younger age and female sex and false positive assessment was associated with malignancy, immunosuppression, respiratory and cardiovascular comorbidities.Emergency telephone triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 achieved a high sensitivity to serious adverse outcomes. Further research is required to identify ways specificity of triage could be improved to reduce unnecessary ambulance dispatch.","output":"Accuracy of emergency (999) telephone triage for predicting adverse outcomes in suspected COVID-19: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the overlap of topics of online news articles from a variety of sources. To do this, we provide a platform for studying the news by measuring this overlap and scoring news stories according to the degree of attention in near-real time. This can enable multiple studies, including identifying topics that receive the most attention from news organizations and identifying slow news days versus major news days. Our application, StoryGraph, periodically (10-minute intervals) extracts the first five news articles from the RSS feeds of 17 US news media organizations across the partisanship spectrum (left, center, and right). From these articles, StoryGraph extracts named entities (PEOPLE, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, etc.) and then represents each news article with its set of extracted named entities. Finally, StoryGraph generates a news similarity graph where the nodes represent news articles, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents a high degree of similarity between the nodes (similar news stories). Each news story within the news similarity graph is assigned an attention score which quantifies the amount of attention the topics in the news story receive collectively from the news media organizations.

The Mendelian randomization approach further indicated a causal effect of higher coffee intake on reduced total GMV, which is likely through regulating the expression of genes responsible for synaptic development in the brain. The identified genetic factors may further affect people's lifestyle habits and body/blood fat levels through the mediation of cereal/coffee intake, and the brain-wide expression pattern of gene CPLX3, a dedicated marker of subplate neurons that regulate cortical development and plasticity, may underlie the shared GMV-association patterns among the coffee/cereal intake and cognitive functions.

The TaqMan Array Card (TAC) was used for screening for 28 different enteropathogens in 718 stools from children less than 13 years of age who presented with diarrhea and were admitted to Kilifi County Hospital, coastal Kenya, in 2013 (before vaccine introduction) and in 2016-2018 (after vaccine introduction). The differences between pre- and post-Rotarix vaccination periods were examined using univariate and multivariable logistic regressions. Results. In 665 specimens (92.6%), one or more enteropathogens were detected, while in 323 specimens (48.6%), three or more enteropathogens were detected. There was a significant increase in the proportion of samples containing enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (35.7% vs 45.3%, p=0.014), cytomegalovirus (4.2% vs 9.9%, p=0.008), Vibrio cholerae (0.0% vs 2.3%, p=0.019), Strongyloides species (0.8% vs 3.6%, p=0.048) and Dientamoeba fragilis (2.1% vs 7.8%, p=0.004) post-vaccine introduction.

By considering the most up to date information on GDP and carbon intensity of production, this paper represents one of the first attempts to estimate the CO2 emissions change that have taken place in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Results show that more than 195,600 thousand tons of CO2 have been avoided between January and June 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year, representing a -12.1% emissions change. The largest reductions have taken place in the Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail Trade, Transport, Accommodation and Food Service sectors, accounting for more than 93.7% of total CO2 change. Spain, Italy and France have been the most affected areas with -106,600 thousand tons emissions drop. In line with the results provided by previous studies, this paper highlights that the geographical and the sectoral distribution of the CO2 emissions change has been largely influenced by the magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts. In addition, the carbon intensity of production, characterizing the most affected economic activities, has been the main element of differentiation compared to the previous 2008 crisis.

At the macrogeographic scale, we argue the pandemic is unlikely to significantly alter the winner-take-all economic geography and spatial inequality of the global city system.

There is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. It is, thus, promising to design immune-based treatments that inhibit the infectious mechanism of the virus, improve the inadequate immune response, or regulate the hyperactivated immune response in severely ill patients.

However, the identification of these molecules is important for understanding both the mechanism of detection and potentially the biology of the underlying infection. Here, we used nanoscale liquid chromatography tandem MS to identify endogenous peptides found in nasal swab saline transport media to identify peptides in the same the mass over charge (m/z) values observed by the MALDI-TOF-MS method. With our peptidomics workflow, we demonstrate that we can identify endogenous peptides and endogenous protease cut sites.

Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. Results Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits.

The nonlinear host-vector-predator model is numerically treated through the LMBNNs, and comparative investigations have been performed using the reference solutions. The obtained results of the model are presented using the LMBNNs to reduce the mean square error (MSE). For the competence, exactness, consistency, and efficacy of the LMBNNs, the numerical results using the proportional measures through the MSE, error histograms (EHs), and regression/correlation are performed.","output":"Competency of Neural Networks for the Numerical Treatment of Nonlinear Host-Vector-Predator Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper extends earlier research by adding SWIFT data on documentary collections to the short-term forecast of international trade.

Design, Setting, and Participants. Post-authorization national population-based surveillance using the French enhanced pharmacovigilance surveillance system for COVID-19 vaccines. All cases of suspected hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17-year-old children between June 15th, 2021 and January 1st, 2022, were reported. Each case was assessed for WHO MIS-C criteria. Causality assessment followed 2019 WHO recommendations. Exposure. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Main Outcome and Measures. The main outcome was the reporting rate of post-vaccine hyper-inflammatory syndrome per 1,000,000 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses in 12-17-year-old children. This reporting rate was compared to the MIS-C rate per 1,000,000 12-17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of clinical features between post-vaccine hyper-inflammatory syndrome and post SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C. Results. From June 2021 to January 2022, 8,113,058 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 4,079,234 12-17-year-old children. Among them, 9 presented a multisystemic hyper-inflammatory syndrome. All cases fulfilled MIS-C WHO criteria. Main clinical features included male predominance (8/9, 89%), cardiac involvement (8/9, 89%), digestive symptoms (7/9, 78%), coagulopathy (5/9, 54%), cytolytic hepatitis (4/9, 46%), and shock (3/9, 33%). 3/9 (33%) required intensive care unit transfer, and 2/9 (22%) hemodynamic support. All cases recovered. Only three cases had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reporting rate was 1.1 (95%CI [0.5; 2.1]) per 1,000,000 doses injected. As a comparison, 113 MIS-C (95%CI [95; 135]) occurred per 1,000,000 12-17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Very few cases of hyper-inflammatory syndromes with multi-organ involvement occurred following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17-year-old children. The low reporting rate of this syndrome, compared to the rate of MIS-C among same age children infected by SARS-CoV-2, supports the benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children.

Underlying medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have been associated with increased risk for severe illness. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by surface spike protein binding to host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Isolated S protein of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to induce an innate immune response. Here we investigate the cytokine response of monocytes with and without comorbidities (obesity and hypertension) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the effects of this response on endothelial barrier function. Methods Human CD14+ monocytes (Lonza, Precision for Medicine) from two Caucasian males in their 50s, one with obesity and hypertension (HTN) and one without, were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL [positive control]), recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD, 10 ug/mL) or serum-free media (negative control) for 48 hours. Monocyte conditioned media (MCM) was collected and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4) were analyzed by multiplex ELISA. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) from a healthy donor were exposed to MCM from healthy or HTN subjects. Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Briefly, HLMVECs were seeded on ECIS chambers to proliferate until impedance plateaued. Half of the media was then replaced with MCM. Differences in impedance drops were compared among various conditions. Western blotting was used to investigate Spike RBD internalization. Results Spike RBD and resulted in increased IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, and TNF-alpha compared to negative control (Fig1A). Monocytes from HTN subject showed increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12p70 compared to those from the healthy subject (Fig 1B). HLMVECs showed moderate long-term barrier disruption, when treated with Spike RBD alone and Spike RBD with MCM from healthy subjects and no difference in transient barrier disruption or recovery. HLMVECs exposed to MCM from HTN subjects showed increased long-term barrier dysfunction, especially with Spike RBD present, and recovery of barrier function was also hampered (Fig 2). Spike RBD was observed to be internalized by both monocytes and HLMVECs. Discussion Spike RBD alone induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by CD14+ monocytes and is further increased in monocytes from the obese/HTN subject. Exposure to Spike RBD and MCM from both healthy and HTN subjects caused significant long-term endothelial barrier dysfunction in HLMVECs with increased dysfunction seen for the obese/HTN MCM. These results are consistent with clinical experience with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased disease severity, and worse outcome in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Further work is being done to characterize the cytokine profile and mechanisms of barrier dysfunction.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-Induced Inflammatory Response by CD14+ Monocytes Causes Endothelial Barrier Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Emerging infectious diseases like COVID19 are driven by ecological and socioeconomic factors, and their rapid spread and devastating impacts mirror those of invasive species.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of thromboembolism in mild/moderate cases of COVID-19. All of the patients had normal coagulation tests and none had any overt thrombotic complications. Our findings indicate that it is important to screen the thrombotic status of cases with mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Between 11 June and 8 July 2020, 23 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia consented to having computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CPTA) and computed tomography venography (CTV) scans of the lungs and extremity veins. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was also performed in all patients for screening. The incidence, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging features, and prognosis, of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) were analyzed and compared with those of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without VTE. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (82.6%) had VTE, mainly distal limb thrombosis. Only one of the VTE patients was positive when screened by DUS; the other VTE patients were negative by DUS. All of the mild/moderate patients with VTE were screened by CTPA + CTV. Blood tests for inflammatory, coagulation, and biochemical, parameters were all within the normal range, except for WBC and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: When using CTV screening for DVT, we found that the incidence of thrombosis in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 markedly increased to 82.6% (19/23). Screening for thrombosis is therefore important in patients with COVID-19. CTV is more sensitive than DUS for the detection of thrombosis.

For stage I, Black women had worse CSS for all histologies other than clear cell in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. For stage II, Black women had worse CSS for endometrioid histology in unadjusted analyses and similar OS. For stage III, Black women with endometrioid carcinoma had worse CSS and OS in unadjusted analyses, but no significant difference in CSS in adjusted analyses. \\"Other\\" race showed improved OS for Stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma without significant differences in outcomes when compared to White women. Conclusion: Across histologies other than clear cell, Black women diagnosed with stage I endometrial cancer had consistently worse CSS, despite similar receipt of adjuvant therapy. Differences in CSS and OS at higher stages disappeared once accounting for treatment disparities.","output":"Disparities in cancer-specific and overall survival in black women with endometrial cancer: A Medicare-SEER study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of crime is a universal problem, including during the COVID 19 pandemic, which is a disease that spreads rapidly and is deadly. With the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have recorded a decrease in crime, but there are several records for increasing numbers of street crime, domestic violence and cyber crime. This phenomenon was triggered by economic factors, where during the COVID 19 pandemic there were restrictions in various sectors in efforts to prevent the spread of COVID 19. The approach method used in this study was the statute approach and the research specifications used the descriptive analytical method. Analytical descriptive is a study that describes, finds legal facts as a whole and systematically studies secondary data. Based on the analysis, it shows that in addition to several factors conducive to the occurrence of crime as well as obstacles in clearly finding the causes of crime, a concept or system is needed that must be carried out continuously and continuously for the prevention and handling of crimes that occur in society by involving various kinds of state elements including citizens.

People with diabetes have been shown to be at higher risk of complications and death when exposed to pneumonia, influenza and other coronaviruses. Despite pandemic scale infection, there is currently limited understanding on the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on people with diabetes. Aims (1) To characterise the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 for people with diabetes and (2) add value to current recommendations for healthcare providers and people with diabetes to encourage optimal management. Methods A search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE to March 2020 was undertaken, using search terms pertaining to diabetes, coronavirus and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We briefly reviewed the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV in the context of diabetes. Conclusion People with diabetes are at greater risk of severe infection and death with COVID-19. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the daily lives of individuals living with diabetes through financial implications, food and medication scarcity and its burden on mental health.

METHODS: A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted with paediatric postgraduate trainees who used an online English-language breastfeeding module in two Thai universities (May 2020, done online) and two Malaysian universities (Sept- Nov 2019, in-person). FGDs explored module usability and utility. Sessions were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The process of coding was done collaboratively by Thai and Malaysian researchers. RESULTS: Twenty Six resident trainees participated (Thai, n = 13; Malaysian, n = 13). Ages ranged from 29C34 years old, with 21 females. Nineteen participants had never used online learning modules prior to this. Participants took between 1 to 5 sessions to complete the breastfeeding module. Four themes emerged from their experience. 1) The online learning module was more engaging and detailed than previous lectures, courses and/or books, but lacked hands-on training. 2) Using an online platform facilitated learning as eased navigation and resource searching, however, problems were encountered navigating the module on some devices. 3) Learners preferred less words and more graphics, as this helped them capture key messages. 4) Regionally tailored content elicited a mixed reaction from participants. CONCLUSIONS: Users found that the adapted module compared favourably with previous learning experiences. However, online learning modules lack hands-on training, and implementation should ideally incorporate a mix of both. Consideration of device diversity and preferences for how content was adapted for local settings are needed for tailoring.

This study aims to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among HCW. METHODS: A multi-centre online cross-sectional survey was performed across 6 primary care clinics from May to June 2021, after completion of staff vaccination exercise. Demographics, profession, years working in healthcare, residential status, presence of chronic medical conditions, self-perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 and previous influenza vaccination were collected. HCW who accepted vaccine were then asked to rank their top 5 reasons for vaccine acceptance; HCW who were vaccine hesitant had to complete the 15-item 5C scale on psychological antecedents of vaccination. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty seven out of 1182 eligible HCW responded (47.1%). Twenty nine were excluded due to contraindications. Among 528 respondents, vaccine acceptance rate was 94.9% (n = 501). There were no statistically significant differences in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance between sex, age, ethnicity, profession, number of years in healthcare, living alone, presence of chronic diseases, self-perceived risk or previous influenza vaccination. The top 3 reasons for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ranked by 501 HCW were to protect their family and friends, protect themselves from COVID-19 and due to high risk of acquiring COVID-19 because of their jobs. HCW with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 exposure were 3.4 times more likely to rank high risk at work as one of the top reasons for vaccine acceptance ((2) = 41.9, p < 0.001, OR = 3.38, 95%C.I. 2.32C4.93). High mean scores of Calculation (5.79) and low scores for Constraint (2.85) for 5C components among vaccine hesitant HCW (n = 27) highlighted that accessibility was not a concern; HCW took time to weigh vaccine benefits and consequences. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a minute issue among Singapore primary HCW, having achieved close to 95% acceptance rate. COVID-19 exposure risk influences vaccine acceptance; time is required for HCW to weigh benefits against the risks. Future studies can focus on settings with higher hesitancy rates, and acceptance of booster vaccinations with the emergence of delta and omicron variants.

METHODS A longitudinal study of 560 participants including 147 healthy controls was conducted between April 30 and May 30, 2020 during a state-wide lockdown. Bi-weekly measures included the Coronavirus Impact Scale, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 7-item. Generalized estimating equations method was used to examine the longitudinal change of the measures within the lockdown and the change from pre-pandemic period to pandemic period. RESULTS All participants reported an impact of lockdown. Individuals with bipolar disorder reported greater impact from the stay-at-home orders with disruptions in routines, income/employment, social support and pandemic related stress. While these measures improved over time, healthy controls recovered quicker and with greater magnitude than persons with bipolar disorder. Comparing mood symptom severity measures in mid-March through May 2020 to the same time window in 2015-2019 (pre- verses post-pandemic), there were no significant differences among individuals with bipolar disorder, whereas healthy controls showed a significant, albeit transient, increase in mood symptoms. CONCLUSION Everyone was impacted by the SARs-CoV pandemic; however, those with bipolar disorder experienced more life impacting changes from the stay-at-home orders vs healthy controls. These disruptions improved over time but much more slowly than healthy controls.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 3,933 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration.

The objective of this paper was to describe the outbreak, including epidemiological and laboratory findings, and the public health response. METHODS: This report summarizes an outbreak of COVID-19 on Cormorant Island, British Columbia, in March and April 2020. Confirmed cases underwent investigation and contact tracing. Supports were provided to ensure successful isolation and quarantine for cases and contacts. Messaging to the community was circulated by trusted community members. Descriptive and social network analyses were conducted to describe the outbreak as it evolved. All case specimens underwent whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Thirty cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Those infected had a median age of 34 years (range 15C77), and the majority identified as female (19, 63%) and as First Nations (27, 90%). The most common symptoms included chills, cough, diarrhea, headache and fever. Five people were hospitalized (17%) and 1 died (3%). Percent positivity in the community was 18%. Transmission occurred primarily during evening social gatherings and within households. Two weeks after control measures were initiated, no further cases were identified. All cases were genetically related by 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms or fewer, and they belonged to the most dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage present in British Columbia in April 2020.

We adapted a SARS stigma scale that was developed using the Berger HIV scale for use as a COVID-19 stigma scale and evaluated its psychometric properties among Egyptian physicians. METHODS: We administered the 17-item SARS stigma scale in an anonymous online questionnaire among 509 Egyptian physicians recruited via convenience sampling during a cross-sectional study in June 2020. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on half of the sample. Confirmatory factor analysis of the resulting model was done using structural equation modeling on the other half. Scale reliability was examined using Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Convergent construct validity was assessed using regression models to examine the association between the adapted COVID-19 stigma scale and relevant factors. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded 16 items (E16-COVID19-S) that supported a three-factor structure: personalized stigma (8 items); concerns of disclosure and public attitudes (5 items); and negative experiences (3 items). Cronbach's &#945; was 0.909 for the total scale and 0.907, 0.663, and 0.789 for the three subscales. E16-COVID19-S was confirmed to have good model fit (comparative fit index = 0.964; root mean squared error of approximation = 0.056).

There is a wide variety of face masks available on the market for various applications, but they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal passage and/or mouth. In this paper, we present a new\\"active mask\\"paradigm, in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a commercial particulate matter sensor, and if necessary activates a piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles, thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control system and manually control the mist generator if necessary.

Guided by the need to reduce face-to-face contacts, medical organisations have rapidly shifted group activities to virtual platforms. Over 1 year into the pandemic, the necessity to maintain public health restrictions ensures that virtual meetings will be the norm for the foreseeable future. It has yet to be understood how virtual technologies shape healthcare and academic cultures, affect interactions, or influence strategic decisions and policies within these systems. Conclusion In this article, the authors reflect on the move from historically situated activity systems of team leadership in healthcare to ones that now exist in virtual formats. Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) is a framework that explains complex human actions, and how they unfold over time through interaction with mediational tools (eg, technology) and various people representing their own communities, roles and perceived divisions of labour. The authors use the lens of CHAT as a framework to understand the shifting dynamics at play and offer strategies for leaders to co-establish activity systems with team members to make goals of group activities explicit and to deliberately work toward them. Five specific strategies proposed are: (1) use software platforms that fit your needs and give voice to all attendees with technical support present in meetings;(2) converse explicitly about roles and emerging role fluidity during times of change and pandemic response;(3) co-construct something new intentionally;(4) engage in implementation science at this time;and (5) lead intentionally while honouring cultural norms and values. It is imperative that any changes, even the ones that are a part of the pandemic response, are made consistent with the core shared values of the medical community as this necessary new way of coming together is embraced with collective wisdom.","output":"Leading by virtual interaction: an application of cultural-historical activity theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To describe the professional quality of life and explore its associated factors among nurses coming from other areas of China to assist with the anti-epidemic fight in Wuhan and especially examine whether the hospital ethical climate was independently associated with nurses professional quality of life Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 2020 to April 2020 The nurses working in Wuhan from the other parts of China were the target population The Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5, the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, and a basic information sheet were used to collect data Descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data Results In total, 236 nurses participated in this study, and 219 valid questionnaires were analyzed The average age of the participants was 31 2  5 0 years Most nurses were female (176/219;80 4%) and married (145/219;66 2%) In term of professional quality of life, nurses reported moderate (129/219;58 9%) to high (90/219;41 1%) levels of compassion satisfaction, low (119/219;54 3%) to moderate (100/219;45 7%) levels of burnout, and low (67/219;36 0%) to high (10/219;4 6%) levels of secondary traumatic stress Regarding hospital ethical climate, nurses reported moderately high hospital ethical climates with an average score of 4 46 After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, the multiple linear regression models showed that the hospital ethical climate subscale of relationship with physicians was independently associated with the compassion satisfaction ( = 0 533, P &lt; 0 01) and burnout ( = ?0 237, P &lt; 0 05);the hospital ethical climate subscale of relationship with peers ( = ?0 191, P &lt; 0 01) was independently associated with the secondary traumatic stress Conclusions During the early stage of the pandemic, nurses demonstrated moderate to high level of compassion satisfaction, low to moderate level of burnout, and all nurses experienced secondary traumatic stress Nurses perceived a high level of hospital ethical climate, and the perceived hospital ethical climate played an important role in promoting nurses professional quality of life during a life-threatening infectious disease pandemic","output":"Hospital ethical climate associated with the professional quality of life among nurses during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurodegeneration. People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many invisible symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.

We aimed to decrease the duration of discharge antibiotic treatment to less than 5 days following inpatient incision and drainage of uncomplicated abscesses. METHODS: A new treatment protocol that defined uncomplicated abscesses, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, was created to monitor the accurate duration of prescribed therapy at discharge. We implemented a treatment algorithm that takes into account the epidemiologic changes in microbial etiologies and the presence of systemic findings for patients after surgical incision and drainage. We used control charts to assess the impact of the interventions. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighteen patients were discharged following abscess drainage from our inpatient infectious diseases unit in 2016. The patients were 3 months to 21 years of age. Only 72 (17%) patients had prescribed discharge antibiotic treatment courses that were less than 5 days [range 0C31 days, median 8 days (IQR 6, 9)], and the average prescribed course at discharge was 8.6 days. During the study period, we significantly decreased the average duration of discharge antibiotics to 7.3 days in all patients (P = 0.0016, 95% CI: ?2.1036 to ?0.4964, difference of means ?1.3). The discharge treatment duration of patients with uncomplicated abscess was shorter at 4.7 days [range 0C9 days, median 5 days, (IQR 3, 5)]. Prescription compliance to less than 5 days treatment course at discharge increased from the baseline of 17% to 42% overall. CONCLUSIONS: Standardizing definitions of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue abscesses was critical to the success of this project.

One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

However, TfR1 also facilitates the cellular entry of multiple mammalian viruses. We use evolutionary and functional analyses of TfR1 in the rodent clade, where two families of viruses bind this receptor, to mechanistically dissect how essential housekeeping genes like TFR1 successfully balance the opposing selective pressures exerted by host and virus. We find that while the sequence of rodent TfR1 is generally conserved, a small set of TfR1 residue positions has evolved rapidly over the speciation of rodents. Remarkably, all of these residues correspond to the two virus binding surfaces of TfR1. We show that naturally occurring mutations at these positions block virus entry while simultaneously preserving iron-uptake functionalities, both in rodent and human TfR1. Thus, by constantly replacing the amino acids encoded at just a few residue positions, TFR1 divorces adaptation to ever-changing viruses from preservation of key cellular functions. These dynamics have driven genetic divergence at the TFR1 locus that now enforces species-specific barriers to virus transmission, limiting both the cross-species and zoonotic transmission of these viruses.","output":"Dual Host-Virus Arms Races Shape an Essential Housekeeping Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines are all designed for intramuscular (IM) immunization.

Most of these long-term interleukin-2-dependent cell lines exhibited a pattern characteristic of CD4(+)-activated T cells with high expression of CD2, CD3 and CD4 antigens, associated with a strong density of TAC and DR molecules. Nevertheless, in five cases CD8 expression was present at a significant level.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).","output":"Will an imperfect vaccine curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the continuance of the global COVID-19 pandemic, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiac injury have been suggested to be risk factors for severe COVID-19.

The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of -coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles.

METHODS This study presents findings from a reanalysis of a 7-center trial conducted in Ontario, Canada, included 209 adults with chronic knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive 28 days of therapy with an active solution (1.5% w/w diclofenac sodium in dimethyl sulfoxide) or 1 of 2 control solutions containing no diclofenac. The key outcome measures used in the current analyses were administered throughout the study period and assessed pain intensity, perceived activity limitations, and a composite score measuring both domains. A structural cross-lagged regression approach was used to determine the reciprocal effects of pain and activity limitations over time. RESULTS In both study groups, participants (N=209) experienced significant reductions in mean pain intensity and activity limitations from baseline to weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 (P<0.001 for both variables). Similarly, there were significant reductions in the activity limitations outcome at weeks 1 and 4 for the active versus control group (P<0.05 for both). Higher levels of perceived activity limitations predicted more future pain at all time points. Cross-lagged associations in which pain predicted subsequent perceived activity limitations were not significant at any time point.

Survey data were collected from CRNAs practicing in Massachusetts and Texas through an email link distributed by their respective state associations of nurse anesthetists. Results of the structural equation modeling showed a decrease in feedback, low CRNA-administration relations scores, and prioritizing work over personal responsibilities were predictive of CRNA burnout. In addition, burnout levels were correlated with job satisfaction and turnover intention. Based on these findings, employers could decrease CRNA burnout and turnover by creating organizational strategies focused on improving job feedback, relationships between CRNAs and administrators, and work-life integration.

Based on the evolutionary similarity with SARS-CoV, researchers propose that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal (GI) system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear. Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case. The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms. COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain. The temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the GI tract, the vascular system, or the gut-brain axis (enteric nervous system) as the most likely entry route for SARS-CoV-2 to the brain.","output":"Temporal Correlation Between Neurological and Gastrointestinal Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Like other clinical biomarkers, trajectories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after kidney transplant are characterized by intra-individual variability. These fluctuations hamper the distinction between alarming graft functional deterioration or harmless fluctuation within the patient-specific expected reference range of eGFR. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a deep learning model could accurately predict the patient-specific expected reference range of eGFR after kidney transplant. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter diagnostic study consisted of a derivation cohort of 933 patients who received a kidney transplant between 2004 and 2013 with 100 867 eGFR measurements from University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, and 2 independent test cohorts: with 39 999 eGFR measurements from 1 170 patients, 1 from University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, receiving transplants between 2013 and 2018 and 1 from Hannover Medical School, Germany, receiving transplants between 2003 and 2007. Patients receiving a single kidney transplant, with consecutive eGFR measurements were included. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to April 2021. EXPOSURES: In the derivation cohort 100 867 eGFR measurements were available for analysis and 39 999 eGFR measurements from the independent test cohorts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A sequence-to-sequence model was developed for prediction of a patient-specific expected range of eGFR, based on previous eGFR values. The primary outcome was the performance of the deep learning sequence-to-sequence model in the 2 independent cohorts. RESULTS: In this diagnostic study, a total of 933 patients in the training sets (mean [SD] age, 53.5 [13.3] years; 570 male [61.1%]) and 1170 patients in the independent test sets (cohort 1 [n = 621]: mean [SD] age, 58.5 [12.1] years; 400 male [64.4%]; cohort 2 [n = 549]: mean [SD] age, 50.1 [13.0] years; 316 male [57.6%]) who received a single kidney transplant most frequently from deceased donors, the sequence-to-sequence models accurately predicted future patient-specific eGFR trajectories within the first 3 months after transplant, based on the previous graft eGFR values (root mean square error, 6.4-8.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The sequence-to-sequence model predictions outperformed the more conventional autoregressive integrated moving average prediction model, at all input/output number of eGFR values. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, a sequence-to-sequence deep learning model was developed and validated for individual forecasting of kidney transplant function. The patient-specific sequence predictions could be used in clinical practice to guide physicians on deviations from the expected intra-individual variability, rather than relating the individual results to the reference range of the healthy population.","output":"Forecasting of Patient-Specific Kidney Transplant Function With a Sequence-to-Sequence Deep Learning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a reversible runtime environment for simple parallel programs and its experimental implementation.

In contrast, an individual airborne pathogen transmission was modelled using a discrete particle model (DPM) to represent the particle flow characteristics. The model was validated using a piecewise approach, and the results were in good agreement with the experimental results. This demonstrated that fan deactivation could reduce pathogen transmission by 24.62%. The reason for this significant reduction is that droplets expelled by assailants during a prayer session lack the propagational energy required to cause infection of other members of the congregation due to disengagement of the fans.

Using both the disk diffusion test and checkerboard assay, we initially examined the effects of combinations of retapamulin with MLS antibiotics against standard strains of these species. Combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and quinupristin showed synergistic activity against E. faecalis only.

Then, a checkerboard assay was performed to evaluate the effects of the combinations against 15 clinical strains of E. faecalis. Retapamulin and quinupristin, the most synergistic combination, showed activity against all erythromycin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains tested. Among the eight strains with high-level erythromycin resistance, five strains were synergistically inhibited in the presence of only 1 g of retapamulin per ml.

Men have higher plasma TAG and impaired TAG clearance compared to women, which may contribute to sex differences in risk of cardiovascular disease. Understanding mechanisms of sex differences in TAG metabolism may yield novel therapeutic targets to prevent cardiovascular disease. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a lipid shuttling protein known for its effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Although mice lack CETP, we previously demonstrated that transgenic CETP expression in female mice alters TAG metabolism. The impact of CETP on TAG metabolism in males, however, is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that CETP expression increases plasma TAG in males, especially in very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), by impairing postprandial plasma TAG clearance compared to wild-type (WT) males. Gonadal hormones were required for CETP to impair TAG clearance, suggesting a role for sex hormones for this effect. Testosterone replacement in the setting of gonadectomy was sufficient to restore the effect of CETP on TAG. Lastly, liver androgen receptor (AR) was required for CETP to increase plasma TAG. Thus, expression of CETP in males raises plasma TAG by impairing TAG clearance via testosterone signaling to AR. Further understanding of how CETP and androgen signaling impair TAG clearance may lead to novel approaches to reduce TAG and mitigate risk of cardiovascular disease.","output":"Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Impairs Triglyceride Clearance via Androgen Receptor in Male Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD40 ligation has been shown to promote antigen-presenting functions of dendritic cells, which express CD40 receptor. Here we reported significantly altered biodistribution and immune responses with the use of CD40-targeted adenovirus. Compared with unmodified adenovirus 5, the CD40-targeted adenovirus following intravenous administration (i.v.) resulted in increased transgene expressions in the lung and thymus, which normally do not take up significant amounts of adenovirus. Intradermal injection saw modified adenovirus being mainly processed in local draining lymph nodes and skin. Following intranasal administration (i.n.), neither unmodified nor targeted viruses were found to be in the liver or spleen, which predominantly took up the virus following i.v. administration. However, inadvertent infection of the brain was found with unmodified adenoviruses, with the second highest gene expression among 14 tissues examined. Importantly, such undesirable effects were largely ablated with the use of targeted vector. Moreover, the targeted adenovirus elicited more sustained antigen-specific cellular immune responses (up to 17-fold) at later time points (30 days post boosting), but also significantly hampered humoral responses irrespective of administration routes. Additional data suggest the skewed immune responses induced by the targeted adenoviruses were not due to the identity of the transgene but more likely a combination of overall transgene load and CD40 stimulation.

However, these SNPs explain only 25% of the overall genetic variance and suggest a role of rare variants in BD vulnerability. Here, we combined high-throughput genotyping data and whole-exome sequencing in cohorts of individuals with BD as well as in multiplex families with a high density of affected individuals in order to determine the contribution of both common and rare variants to BD genetic vulnerability. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we showed a strong contribution of common polymorphisms previously associated with BD and schizophrenia (SZ) and noticed that those specifically associated with SZ contributed more in familial forms of BD than in non-familial ones. The analysis of rare damaging variants shared by affected individuals in multiplex families with BD revealed a single interaction network enriched in neuronal and developmental biological pathways, as well as in the regulation of gene expression. We identified four genes with a higher mutation rate in individuals with BD than in the general population and showed that mutations in two of them were associated with specific clinical manifestations. In addition, we showed a significant negative correlation between PRS and the number of rare damaging variants specifically in unaffected individuals of multiplex families.

Anti-tumor effects of tamoxifen in breast cancer are well-established. However, no study has so far investigated the effects of tamoxifen on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in gastric cancer cell line. The present study was conducted to explore the effects of tamoxifen, as a repurposed drug, on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in MKN-45, a gastric cancer cell line. METHODS: MKN-45 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS. Cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen on these cells at various concentrations were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay. For gene expression analysis, the cells were first incubated with 100 M tamoxifen followed by total RNA extraction from treated and control cells. Then, cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative real-time PCR using specific primers for Notch1 and DLL1 was performed to assess the effect of tamoxifen on the transcript of them. RESULTS: Treatment with tamoxifen decreased viability of MKN-45 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CC50 was estimated to be around 200 M. Also, tamoxifen at the dose of 100 M could significantly downregulate mRNA levels of both Notch1 and DLL1 genes as compared with untreated cells by 24% and 92%, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Questionnaires were completed by 369 individuals who were conscripted to support Wuhan (N=137) and others who were not (the control group; N=232). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration and quality of sleep. The Anhui Provincial Health Commission organized a comprehensive intervention, consisting of physical-psychological-social dimensions, over the course of 2 weeks. RESULTS Only 34.21% of the Wuhan support workers reported better sleep quality, as opposed to the 55.60% of the control group at stage 1 (t/&#967;2=14.005, P<.001). Furthermore, despite the Wuhan support group being more prone to poor sleep quality, their sleep quality significantly improved after the interventions.

This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of this disease on adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) at 1 month after the start of the outbreak in China. METHODS: Using the Childrens Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) questionnaire, we investigated the occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in two groups of adolescents: MDD patients who were in continuous antidepressant therapy and healthy controls. Total scores and factor subscores were compared between the two groups and subgroups stratified by sex and school grade. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with high total CRIES-13 scores. RESULTS: Compared to controls (n = 107), the MDD group (n = 90) had higher total CRIES-13 scores and a higher proportion with a total score  30. They also had a lower intrusion subscore and a higher arousal subscore. In the MDD group, males and females did not differ significantly in total CRIES-13 scores or factor subscores, but junior high school students had higher avoidance subscores than senior high school students. Logistic regression showed high total CRIES-13 scores to be associated with MDD and the experience of flashbacks or avoidance of traumatic memories associated with COVID-19.

However, the efficiencies with which they cause cancer vary by over a dozen orders of magnitude. These differences in efficiency are a result of differences in efficiency of formation and expression of the genes for neoplastic transformation. Four models of mechanisms for formation of the genes for neoplastic transformation are presented. Two involve the formation of new DNA sequences.

AmpSeq data for infectious microbes can inform disease control in multiple ways, including measuring drug resistance marker prevalence, distinguishing imported from local cases, and determining the effectiveness of therapeutics. We describe the design and comparative evaluation of two new AmpSeq assays for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: a four-locus panel ('4CAST') composed of highly diverse antigens, and a 129-locus panel ('AMPLseq') composed of drug resistance markers, highly diverse loci for measuring relatedness, and a locus to detect Plasmodium vivax co-infections. We explore the performance of each panel in various public health use cases with in silico simulations as well as empirical experiments. We find that the smaller 4CAST panel performs reliably across a wide range of parasitemia levels without DNA pre-amplification, and could be highly informative for evaluating the number of distinct parasite strains within samples (complexity of infection) and distinguishing recrudescent infections from new infections in therapeutic efficacy studies. The AMPLseq panel performs similarly to two existing panels of comparable size for relatedness measurement, despite differences in the data and approach used for designing each panel. Finally, we describe an R package (paneljudge) that facilitates design and comparative evaluation of AmpSeq panels for relatedness estimation, and we provide general guidance on the design and implementation of AmpSeq panels for genomic epidemiology of infectious disease.","output":"Design and implementation of multiplexed amplicon sequencing panels to serve genomic epidemiology of infectious disease: a malaria case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are evidences that show increased antimicrobial consumption among COVID 19 patients.

DESIGN Single-centre, retrospective, observational study. PATIENTS COVID-19 patients undergoing rehabilitation (24 April to 24 May 2020). METHODS All COVID-19 inpatients undergoing rehabilitation in the general ward were assessed. Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of pneumonia, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, and rehabilitation-related complications. Activities of daily living were measured using the Barthel Index. RESULTS Out of a total of 43 patients, 14 were initially provided with remote rehabilitation and 29 with direct rehabilitation. Four patients were switched from direct to remote rehabilitation during the study, thus at the end of the study there were 18 in the remote rehabilitation group and 25 in the direct rehabilitation group. Patients in remote rehabilitation were significantly younger than those in direct rehabilitation. Of 12 patients who required intubation, 3 were given remote rehabilitation. One extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivor underwent direct rehabilitation. All patients on remote rehabilitation were discharged home or to a hotel. Twelve out of 29 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation hospital due to delayed recovery of activities of daily living. No serious adverse events occurred.

We will evaluate the degree of reproducibility that the different experiments have shown in the indication of biomarkers, and a synthesis will be attempted to obtain a consensus list that is more likely to become a guideline for clinical practice. In further analysis, we will inquire into the origin of these dysregulated metabolites in patients with bladder cancer. For this purpose, it will be helpful to compare the imbalances measured in urine with those known inside tumor cells or tissues. Although the urine analysis is sometimes considered a liquid biopsy because of its direct contact with the tumor in the bladder wall, it contains metabolites from all organs and tissues of the body, and the tumor is separated from urine by the most impermeable barrier found in mammals.

Even if enoxaparin and fondaparinux have the same clinical indication for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention; to date, there are no data about the use of fondaparinux in terms of safety, effectiveness, and impact on clinical prognosis among COVID-19 patients. Objective: To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and clinical impact of VTE prophylaxis with fondaparinux and enoxaparin among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in internal medicine units. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective multicenter observation study, including consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to internal medicine units of five Italian hospitals from 15th February to 15th March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety outcome was the composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding; the primary effectiveness outcome was the composite of all events classified as pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. The secondary effectiveness outcome included acute respiratory distress syndrome and all-cause death. Results: Among 120 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the study, 74 were taking enoxaparin (4,000 or 6,000 units/day) and 46 fondaparinux (2.5 units/day). No statistically significant difference in demographic and laboratory and clinical characteristics between the two groups has been shown. During a median follow-up of 32 (interquartile range: 14C51) days, the cumulative incidence rates of VTE and bleeding events on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with heparins were 19% and 8%, respectively. The incidence of both VTE (6.5 vs. 13.5%; P = 0.36) and bleeding events (6.5 vs. 4.1%; P = 0.68) did not show a significant difference between COVID-19 patients on fondaparinux compared with those on enoxaparin therapy. The regression model for the risk of outcome events according to different VTE prophylaxis drugs did not show significant differences.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points). CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.","output":"Clinical prediction rule for SARS-CoV-2 infection from 116 U.S. emergency departments 2-22-2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Data regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on patients with Inflammatory bowel disease is scarce. Fecal calprotectin (FC) correlates with IBD clinical and endoscopic activity. We compared fecal calprotectin levels between patients with COVID-19 to a control group tested negative to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We gathered data from a large health medical organization in Israel of insured individuals who underwent a SARS-COV-2 PCR test from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Among patients with IBD, data regarding fecal calprotectin taken 30-365 days before SARS-CoV-2 testing was gathered. We compared fecal calprotectin levels taken at least 30 days following COVID-19 infection to those who tested negative. Results: 1924 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 949 Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2. 322 (16.7%) were tested positive in the CD group and 114 (13.7%) in the UC group. Pre-COVID-19 calprotectin levels did not show statistically significant differences between patients who ended up testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative in CD (377 759.08 vs. 451.84869, p-value = 0.4) and in UC (466.93766.69 vs. 617.91 1243.99 p-value=0.37).

Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the MSM and non-Japanese subgroups.

Increased hypertension treatment coverage (the proportion of individuals initiated on treatment) and adherence (proportion of patients taking medicines as recommended) promise population health gains. However, governments and other payers will not invest in a large-scale hypertension control program unless it is both affordable and effective. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a national hypertension control intervention implemented across the private and public sector facilities in India could save overall costs of CVD prevention and treatment. METHODS: We developed a discrete-time microsimulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension control intervention in India for combinations of treatment coverage and adherence targets. Input clinical parameters specific to India were obtained from large-scale surveys such as the Global Burden of Disease as well as local clinical trials. Input hypertensive medication cost parameters were based on government contracts. The model projected antihypertensive treatment costs, avoided CVD care costs, changes in disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) and incremental cost per DALY averted (represented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER) over 20 years. RESULTS: Over 20 years, at 70% coverage and adherence, the hypertension control intervention would avert 1.68% DALYs and be cost-saving overall. Increasing adherence (while keeping coverage constant) resulted in greater improvement in cost savings compared to increasing coverage (while keeping adherence constant). Results were most sensitive to the cost of antihypertensive medication, but the intervention remained highly cost-effective under all one-way sensitivity analyses.

Overall, the study results suggest that the patterns of student engagement identified in the study tend to approximate the ones that characterize face-to-face settings. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Engaging Students During Synchronous Video-Conferencing in COVID19 Times: Preliminary Findings from a Design Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung Disease is one of the most common healthcare issues in the entire world in all age groups of humans due to the cause of smoking, infection and contaminated air. Pneumonia, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Tuberculosis are the common types of lung disease. To reduce the diagnosis of the Lung Disease, several research works have been done with the help of Artificial Intelligence based-technologies. Prediction and classification of Lung Disease are the common tasks using Chest X-ray images, CT scan images, and MRI images with the help of machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning models. The main idea of this paper is to show the comparative analysis of ResNet-50, MobileNet-V2, VGG-19 and DenseNet201 CNN-based Transfer Learning techniques and suggesting which image classification algorithm is more recommended to predicting and classifying Lung Disease classification problem. Those four algorithms have been trained on the X-ray images and evaluated using performance metrics techniques. The results have been shown 94.64% accuracy obtained using ResNet50, 97.43% accuracy obtained using VGG19, 98.49% accuracy obtained using MobileNetV2, and 98.05% accuracy obtained using DenseNet201 pre-trained model. Based on the experimental results MobileNet model has been outperformed as compared to other models. Training time per epoch and ROC-AUC values of MobileNet was better than other models.

The present study examined the psychological consequences of COVID-19 in Bangladesh during the lockdown period. METHODS: A nationwide online cross-sectional survey study recruited 10,067 individuals covering all 64 districts in Bangladesh via social media (April 1-10, 2020). The survey comprised questions concerning socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behavior towards COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to identify the risk factors depression and suicidal ideation. Geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis was used to identify district-wise susceptibility to depression and suicidal ideation. FINDINGS: The prevalence rate of depression and suicidal ideation related to COVID-19 was 33% and 5%%. Common risk factors for suicidal ideation and depression included being young, being female, being a cigarette smoker, having comorbid diseases, having high scores on the Fear COVID-19 Scale, and having insomnia symptoms. GIS-based maps detected high depression and suicidal ideation in the capital of Bangladesh and the districts near the capital as well as coastal areas where COVID-19 prevalence was high, as compared with districts with no reported cases. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported scales and cross-sectional design of the study. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with major psychological impact across Bangladesh, underlining the need of strategically located psychological support measures and improved access to mental health services, especially among women and younger people.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and serious psychological consequences in Bangladesh: A population-based nationwide study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although ocular manifestations are commonly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is currently no consensus on ocular tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To investigate this, we infected K18-hACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2 using various routes. We observed ocular manifestation and retinal inflammation with cytokine production in the eyes of intranasally (IN) infected mice. An intratracheal (IT) injection resulted in virus spread from the lungs to the brain and eyes via trigeminal and optic nerves. Ocular and neuronal invasion were confirmed by an intracerebral (IC) infection. Notably, eye-dropped (ED) virus did not infect the lungs and was undetectable with time. Using infectious SARS-CoV-2-mCherry clones, we demonstrated the ocular and neurotropic distribution of the virus in vivo by a fluorescence-imaging system. Evidence for the ocular tropic and neuroinvasive characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in wild-type Syrian hamsters. Our data provides further understanding of the viral transmission; SARS-CoV-2 clinical characteristics; and COVID-19 control procedures. SummarySARS-CoV-2 can spread from the respiratory tract to the brain and eyes via trigeminal and optic nerves in animal models. This ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 through neuronal invasion likely causes ocular manifestation and retinal inflammation.

The collection of indoor air samples was performed from each transport vehicle in both directions once a month from March 2017 to February 2018. The highest and lowest CAF concentrations measured during the study were determined to be 40C660 CFU/m(3) in bus, 20C400 CFU/m(3) in metro, 40C360 CFU/m(3) in metrobus, and 20C260 CFU/m(3) in ferry. It was determined that no fungal colonies were observed on the ferry on the inbound route in March. The findings demonstrated that CAF concentrations in bus were higher compared to the indoor air in other transport vehicles, and there was a significant correlation between fungal levels and the number of passengers (p < 0.05; r = 0.68) and RH% (p < 0.05; r = 0.43). In line with the density order of fourteen fungal species determined, Penicillium spp., Paecilomyces spp., and Aspergillus spp. were identified.

However, when the virus enters the body it also interacts with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. Alterations in the gut microbiome species and metabolites have been noted during respiratory viral infections, possibly impacting the lungs via gut-lung microbiome crosstalk. To better characterize microbial functions in the lower respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we carry out a functional analysis of previously published metatranscriptome sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 cases, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The functional profiles resulting from comparing the sequences against annotated microbial protein domains clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the associated metabolic pathways, distinguishing functional signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased potential for lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, and increased potential for carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The results include overlap between previous studies on COVID-19 microbiomes, including decrease in the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway and increase in carbohydrate metabolism.

These events include betrayal. Moral injury can have impact on symptoms of symptoms such as mental distress, posttraumatic symptoms, suicidal behavior, substance abuse, demoralization and hopelessness and interpersonal problems and loss of trust.

However, the protection level of non-medical face masks, such as women face veils, is still uncertain. This study aimed to assess the filtration efficiency (FE;percentage of particles retained by a mask) of different types of medical masks (either as sealed or unsealed, single or doubled), non-medical masks (cloth masks) and face veils. FE of face masks was evaluated using an in-house 3D-printed air duct connected to the Aerotrak particle counter with a capability of counting particle sizes of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 2 and 5 mu m. A set of 10 earloop surgical masks,10 tie-on surgical masks, 3 triple-layers reusable cloth masks and 3 types (short, medium and long) of traditional face veils were included in the study. The unsealed surgical masks showed intermediate FE (36.54-80.58%), with no observed differences between tie-on and earloop or single and doubled masks. For each mask type, the mean FE values of sealed surgical masks (FE=99.16%) was significantly higher (P<0.001) than the unsealed ones (FE=80.58%). No significant difference was observed in the mean FE values between unsealed surgical masks and either cloth masks (FE=23.19-75.35%, P=0.26) or face veils (FE=19.10-70.68%, P=0.14). However, a mockup experiment showed that wearing a surgical mask under the face veil significantly improve the FE (33.73-79.18%;P<0.001). We conclude that besides sealed surgical masks that ensure optimal filtration under the experimental conditions, the unsealed surgical and cloth masks and face veils showed comparable performance and acceptable protection at 5 mu m particle size, which is the most relevant particle size associated with COVID-19 infectious droplets.

This growth has been particularly rapid during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many reports indicate informal services using IM, in particular WhatsApp, have arisen spontaneously, in the absence of any formal guidelines and little consideration of consent. This study documents the consent practices of healthcare professionals using IM for clinical activities in District Hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and compares these practices with the literature. Methods: As part of a larger audit of telemedicine activity in KwaZulu-Natal a survey questioned clinicians' use of IM, including consent practices and awareness of regulatory guidelines. Concomitantly multiple electronic databases were searched for papers on WhatsApp use in clinical service. Inclusion criteria were: papers written in English, reported on WhatsApp in clinical use or potential clinical use, and addressed consent. Results: The survey confirmed anecdotal reports of widespread informal use of WhatsApp in District Hospitals. Most clinicians were unaware of regulatory guidelines, and few obtained consent for taking photographs or sharing of images and information with colleagues for consultation. The literature review found that consent was mentioned in only 28 papers. Of these 11 reported that written consent was obtained, of which 5 were for taking photographs and 4 for sharing information with colleagues. Discussion: The survey showed that more than half of the respondents who used IM did not consider this to be telemedicine, with the corresponding ethical requirements governed by national guidelines, thereby risking legal exposure. However, South Africa's regulatory guidelines do not align with common clinical practice. The literature shows that the majority of doctors shared patient information by IM without obtaining any form of consent. Conclusion: Practical guidelines are urgently required in South Africa and worldwide that balance practical conduct of medical care with sound contemporary ethical principles.

METHODS: Seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Department of Geriatrics at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were included. Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Laboratory tests and chest computed tomography (CT) images from the patients before and after the COVID-19 infection were compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 91 years old (87-96). Six patients had pneumonia in the last 6 months. Dyspnea occurred in one patient 64 h after the onset of the disease. In the other six patients, minor fatigue with low fever were the only other manifestations of the disease.

Although much of this work has been done in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning, it may have important implications for fear memories in humans such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study suggested that cued fear memories, made labile by memory retrieval, were made additionally labile and thus more vulnerable to subsequent modification when mice inhaled 10% carbon dioxide (CO(2)) during retrieval. In light of this finding, we hypothesized that 10% CO(2) inhalation soon after fear acquisition might affect memory recall 24 h later. We found that both cue and context fear memory were increased by CO(2) exposure after fear acquisition. The effect of CO(2) was time-dependent, as CO(2) inhalation administered 1 or 4 h after cued fear acquisition increased fear memory, whereas CO(2) inhalation 4 h before or 24 h after cued fear acquisition did not increase fear memory. The ability of CO(2) exposure following acquisition to enhance fear memory was not a general consequence of stress, as restraining mice after acquisition did not alter cued fear memory. The memory-enhancing action of CO(2) may be relatively specific to fear conditioning as novel object recognition was impaired by post-training CO(2) inhalation. To explore the molecular underpinnings of these effects, we tested if they depended on the acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1A), a proton-gated cation channel that mediates other effects of CO(2), likely via its ability to sense acidosis induced during CO(2) inhalation. We found that CO(2) inhalation did not alter cued or context fear memory in Asic1a(C/C) mice, suggesting that this phenomenon critically depends on ASIC1A. These results suggest that brain acidosis around the time of a traumatic event may enhance memory of the trauma, and may thus constitute an important risk factor for developing PTSD. Moreover, preventing peritraumatic acidosis might reduce risk of PTSD.","output":"Post-acquisition CO(2) Inhalation Enhances Fear Memory and Depends on ASIC1A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The text clustering technique is an unsupervised text mining method which are used to partition a huge amount of text documents into groups.

In this paper, we present a hybrid multisource feature fusion (HMFF) framework comprising three components, feature representation of multimodel, mutual similarity matrices and feature fusion, in which we construct mutual similarity matrices for each feature source and fuse discriminative features from mutual similarity matrices by reducing dimensionality to generate HMFF features, then k-means clustering algorithm could be configured to partition input samples into groups. The experimental tests show our HMFF framework outperforms other recently published algorithms on 7 of 11 public benchmark datasets and has the leading performance on the rest 4 benchmark datasets as well. At last, we compare HMFF framework with those competitors on a COVID-19 dataset from the wild with the unknown cluster count, which shows the clusters generated by HMFF framework partition those similar samples much closer.","output":"Hybrid Multisource Feature Fusion for the Text Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. To describe a health equity curriculum created for pharmacy students and evaluate students' perceptions and structural competency after completion of the curriculum.Methods. A health equity curriculum (HEC) based on transformative learning and structural competency frameworks was implemented as a 10-week mandatory component of the pass-no pass neuropsychiatric theme for second-year pharmacy students. Each week, students reviewed materials around a neuropsychiatric-related health equity topic and responded to discussion prompts through asynchronous forums or synchronous Zoom discussions. The HEC was evaluated through assessment of structural competency through a validated instrument (SCI), an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and a questionnaire.Results. All enrolled second-year pharmacy students (n=124) participated in the HEC. Of the 75 (68%) students who completed the SCI, 46 (61%) were able to identify structural determinants of health, explain how structures contribute to health disparities, or design structural interventions. Ninety-six (77%) students were able to address their OSCE standardized patient's mistrust in the healthcare system. Thematic analysis of student comments elucidated three themes-allyship, peer connection, and self-awareness. Students rated asynchronous discussion forums as significantly less effective than Zoom discussions and patient cases for achieving curricular objectives.Conclusion. A remote, mandatory, blended health equity curriculum demonstrated an effective model for social justice-oriented education. From our experience, a curriculum spread throughout the didactic curriculum with a blended approach is an effective way to incorporate health equity conversations into existing programs and could be an important step in training student pharmacists to be advocates for social justice.","output":"Implementation and Evaluation of a 10-Week Health Equity Curriculum for Pharmacy Students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the whole world is fighting a very dangerous and infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, called COVID-19. The COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world due to its high infection rate. Therefore, early discovery of COVID-19 is crucial to better treat the infected person as well as to slow down the spread of this virus. However, the current solution for detecting COVID-19 cases including the PCR test, CT images, epidemiologically history, and clinical symptoms suffer from high false positive. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel transfer deep learning approach for detecting COVID-19 based on x-ray images. Our approach helps medical staff in determining if a patient is normal, has COVID-19, or other pneumonia. Our approach relies on pre-trained models including Inception-V3, Xception, and MobileNet to perform two tasks: i) binary classification to determine if a person infected with COVID-19 or not and ii) a multi-task classification problem to distinguish normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia cases. Our experimental results on a large dataset show that the F1-score is 100% in the first task and 97.66 in the second task. ? 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Although stroke is predominantly a disease of older people, our knowledge of frailty in stroke is limited. We aimed to collate the literature on acute stroke and frailty to estimate the prevalence of pre-stroke frailty and its associations with outcomes. METHODS paired researchers searched multidisciplinary electronic databases for papers describing frailty and acute stroke. We assessed risk of bias using Newcastle-Ottawa tools appropriate to study design. We created summary estimates of pre-stroke frailty using random effects models. We collated whether studies reported significant positive associations between frailty and clinical outcomes in adjusted models. RESULTS we included 14 studies (n = 27,210 participants). Seven studies (n = 8,840) used a frailty index approach, four studies (n = 14,924) used Hospital Frailty Risk Scores. Pooled prevalence of pre-stroke frailty was 24.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 16.2-33.1%; low quality evidence, downgraded due to heterogeneity, bias). Combining frailty and pre-frailty (nine studies, n = 23,827), prevalence of any frailty syndrome was 66.8% (95%CI: 49.9-83.7%). Seven studies were at risk of bias, from participant selection or method of frailty assessment. Pre-stroke frailty was associated with all adverse outcomes assessed, including longer-term mortality (positive association in 6 of 6 studies reporting this outcome; odds ratio: 3.75 [95%CI: 2.41-5.70]), length of admission (3 of 4 studies) and disability (4 of 6 studies).

The effects of those interventions on hospital use have not been systematically evaluated. The investigation could provide data-driven evidence to potentially improve the implementation of public health interventions in the future. OBJECTIVE: We aim to study two representative areas in the United States and one area in China (New York State, Ohio State, and Hubei Province), and investigate the effects of their public health interventions by time periods according to key interventions. METHODS: This observational study evaluated the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and death cases in New York and Ohio from March 16 through September 14, 2020, and Hubei from January 26 to March 31, 2020. We developed novel Bayesian generalized compartmental models. The clinical stages of COVID-19 were stratified in the models, and the effects of public health interventions were modeled through piecewise exponential functions. Time-dependent transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers were estimated. The associations of interventions and the numbers of required hospital and intensive care unit beds were studied. RESULTS: The interventions of social distancing, home confinement, and wearing masks significantly decreased (in a Bayesian sense) the case incidence and reduced the demand for beds in all areas. Ohios transmission rates declined before the states stay at home order, which provided evidence that early intervention is important. Wearing masks was significantly associated with reducing the transmission rates after reopening, when comparing New York and Ohio. The centralized quarantine intervention in Hubei played a significant role in further preventing and controlling the disease in that area. The estimated rates that cured patients become susceptible in all areas were small (<0.0001), which indicates that they have little chance to get the infection again. CONCLUSIONS: The series of public health interventions in three areas were temporally associated with the burden of COVID-19Cattributed hospital use.

OBJECTIVES: To identify priority areas for AI and PC in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A collaborative consultation event engaged multiple stakeholders in a nominal group technique process to generate, discuss and rank ideas for how AI can support Ontario PC. RESULTS: The consultation process produced nine ranked priorities: (1) preventative care and risk profiling, (2) patient self-management of condition(s), (3) management and synthesis of information, (4) improved communication between PC and AI stakeholders, (5) data sharing and interoperability, (6-tie) clinical decision support, (6-tie) administrative staff support, (8) practitioner clerical and routine task support and (9) increased mental healthcare capacity and support. Themes emerging from small group discussions about barriers, implementation issues and resources needed to support the priorities included: equity and the digital divide; system capacity and culture; data availability and quality; legal and ethical issues; user-centred design; patient-centredness; and proper evaluation of AI-driven tool implementation. DISCUSSION: Findings provide guidance for future work on AI and PC. There are immediate opportunities to use existing resources to develop and test AI for priority areas at the patient, provider and system level.

To support the enduring research on the improvement of COVID-19 therapeutics, herein, we demonstrated the development of highly effective and eco-friendly synthetic routes for the synthesis of dimeric 2,4-diacetyl phloroglucinol 4a, a potent antibiotic and malarial drug candidate via phenol-aldehyde condensation over silica sulphuric acid (SSA) catalyst and the arylation of dimethylammonium salts under greener protocols, i.e., ultrasound-assisted (US) and liquid assisted grinding (LAG) methods. Through an environmental assessment, the cleanness and environmental efficiency of the developed protocols were evidenced to be improved compared with a recently published alternative synthetic pathway, which was indicated by the presence of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact. In addition, we accomplished molecular docking studies to permit the rapid screening of possible therapeutic ligands of 4a and its derivatives along with N3, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir as references against the crystal structure for the recently released 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. Exclusively, our finding showed that compound 4d with an excellent binding affinity of -8.1 kcal occupies the active site in varying ways at the N3 binding site of 3CL(pro), confirming its fitness as a good candidate for the therapeutic action against COVID-19. Furthermore, molecular target prediction, pharmacokinetic studies, prediction of the activity spectra for substances (PASS), density-functional theory (DFT), and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis were also established to highlight the prominence of this chemical scaffold.","output":"Toward an efficient and eco-friendly route for the synthesis of dimeric 2,4-diacetyl phloroglucinol and its potential as a SARS-CoV-2 main protease antagonist: insight from in silico studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The current study assesses the effects of platelet-rich plasma-fibrin glue (PRP-FG) dressing along with oral vitamin E and C on wound healing and biochemical markers in patients with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (non-healing DFU).

They all completed online questionnaires assessing PI, sadness, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and demographic and work-related variables. All groups but protective services workers showed higher PI levels than the general population. Healthcare and grocery workers were the most affected, with 73.6% and 65.2% of the participants, respectively, showing a severe PI. Women showed a higher PI level. Healthcare workers in the regions with higher COVID-19 incidences reported greater PI levels. The main concerns were being infected by COVID-19 or infecting others. Levels of concern correlated with higher PI levels. The protection equipment was generally reported as insufficient, which correlated with higher PI levels. Professionals reporting to overwork during the crisis (60% mass-media, 38% of healthcare and grocery and 21.7% of protective service) showed higher PI levels. In the healthcare group, taking care of patients with COVID-19 (77%) or of dying patients with COVID-19 (43.9%) was associated with higher PI levels. The perceived social recognition of their work was inversely related to PI. Most of the sample had not received psychological support.

As expected, a substantial decrease in performance was found for masked faces. Importantly, the inclusion of masks also led to a qualitative change in the way masked faces are perceived. In particular, holistic processing, the hallmark of face perception, was disrupted for faces with masks, as suggested by a reduced inversion effect. Similar changes were found whether masks were included during the study or the test phases of the experiment.

RESULTS A total of 85 laparoscopic partial nephrectomies were performed in this study (72 cLPN and 13 LESS-PN). The average tumour size was 2.681.47 cm (cLPN) vs. 2.461.11 cm (LESS-PN). The mean duration of surgery was 175.1750.026 min (cLPN) and 185.7735.991 min (LESS-PN). 45 (62.5%) operations (cLPN) vs. 10 (76.9%) (LESS-PN) were performed in zero-ischaemia technique. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome parameters between both groups. Postoperative complication rates (Clavien-Dindo3) were 11.1% (cLPN) vs. 7.7% (LESS-PN).

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S?o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.","output":"Modeling transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in S?o Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent state of public emergency have significantly affected older adults in Canada and worldwide.

It is unknown if the inclusion of clinical gestalt improves ML-based classification of acutely ill patients. As in previous research in ML analysis of medical images, simulated or augmented data may be used to assess the usability of clinical gestalt. Objective: To assess whether a deep learning algorithm trained on a dataset of simulated and augmented facial photographs reflecting acutely ill patients can distinguish between healthy and LPS-infused, acutely ill individuals. Methods: Photographs from twenty-six volunteers whose facial features were manipulated to resemble a state of acute illness were used to extract features of illness and generate a synthetic dataset of acutely ill photographs, using a neural transfer convolutional neural network (NT-CNN) for data augmentation. Then, four distinct CNNs were trained on different parts of the facial photographs and concatenated into one final, stacked CNN which classified individuals as healthy or acutely ill. Finally, the stacked CNN was validated in an external dataset of volunteers injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: In the external validation set, the four individual feature models distinguished acutely ill patients with sensitivities ranging from 10.5% (95% CI, 1.3C33.1% for the skin model) to 89.4% (66.9C98.7%, for the nose model). Specificity ranged from 42.1% (20.3C66.5%) for the nose model and 94.7% (73.9C99.9%) for skin. The stacked model combining all four facial features achieved an area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUROC) of 0.67 (0.62C0.71) and distinguished acutely ill patients with a sensitivity of 100% (82.35C100.00%) and specificity of 42.11% (20.25C66.50%). Conclusion: A deep learning algorithm trained on a synthetic, augmented dataset of facial photographs distinguished between healthy and simulated acutely ill individuals, demonstrating that synthetically generated data can be used to develop algorithms for health conditions in which large datasets are difficult to obtain.

However, the size of the problem and the appropriate approach to deal with the burden is still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the yield, number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one death or adverse event for screening DM and hypertension and assess the prevalence and contributors to DM and/or hypertension. METHODS: Based on PTB contact tracing, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 801 PTB index cases and 972 household contacts from April 2019 to October 2020 in Guizhou, China. All the participants were screened for DM and hypertension. The yield was calculated as the proportion of newly detected cases among the study subjects, excluding known cases. The NNS was computed by dividing the number needed to treat for risk factors by the prevalence of the unrecognized diseases. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the independent predictors of DM and/or hypertension. RESULTS: Of the 1,773 participants, the prevalence of DM and hypertension was 8.7% (70/801) and 15.2% (122/801) in the PTB patients, 3.2% (31/972) and 14.0% (136/972) in the contacts, respectively. The prevalence of DM and/or hypertension was 21.2% (170/801) among the PTB patients and 15.4% (150/972) among their contacts. The screening yields to detect new cases of DM and hypertension among PTB patients were 1.9% and 5.2%, and that in the contacts were 0.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The NNS for DM was 359 for the PTB cases and 977 for the contacts, 299 for PTB cases and 325 for hypertension, respectively.

We hypothesized that abnormalities in arterial oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio or PaO(2)) and PaCO(2) would be associated with hospital mortality following OHCA. We hypothesized that PaCO(2) would significantly modify the oxygenationCmortality relationship. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study using data from OHCA survivors admitted to adult critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2011 to 2018. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hospital mortality and oxygenation and PaCO(2). RESULTS: The analysis included 23,625 patients. In comparison with patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 300 mmHg, those with a PaO(2)/FiO(2)  100 mmHg had higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.15; P < 0.001). In comparison to hyperoxemia (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg), patients with hypoxemia (PaO(2) < 60 mmHg) had higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.65; P = 0.004). In comparison with normocapnia, hypercapnia was associated with lower mortality. Hypocapnia (PaCO2  35 mmHg) was associated with higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.24; P < 0.001). PaCO(2) modified the PaO(2)/FiO(2)Cmortality and PaO(2)Cmortality relationships, though these relationships were complex. Patients who were both hyperoxic and hypercapnic had the lowest mortality.

Rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the most frequent. Other viruses frequently identified are: calicivirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, influenza et para-influenza, rhinovirus and coronavirus. Asymptomatic infections occur frequently.

Methods We used a modified susceptibleCexposedCinfectedCrecovered (SEIR) model to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, from 21 January to 21 September 2020, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to calculate 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). We used the model to assess the effectiveness of physical distancing measures and self-isolation under different scenarios. We also estimated the control reproductive number (R c ), using our mathematical model and epidemiologic data. Results If no non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were applied, there could have been a cumulative number of 51,800,000 (95% UI: 19,100,000C77,600,000) COVID-19 infections and 266,000 (95% UI: 119,000C476,000) deaths by September 21 2020. If physical distancing interventions, such as school/border closures and self-isolation interventions, had been introduced a week earlier than they were actually launched, a 30% reduction in the number of infections and deaths could have been achieved by September 21 2020.

We previously reported an expanded CD14(+) monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis and validated expansion of this cell subpopulation in publicly available transcriptomics data. Here, using published datasets, we show that the gene expression program associated with MS1 correlated with sepsis severity and was up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. To examine the ontogeny and function of MS1 cells, we developed a cellular model for inducing CD14(+) MS1 monocytes from healthy bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 induced myelopoiesis in HSPCs in vitro and expression of the MS1 gene program in monocytes and neutrophils that differentiated from these HSPCs. Furthermore, we found that plasma concentrations of IL-6, and to a lesser extent IL-10, correlated with increased myeloid cell output from HSPCs in vitro and enhanced expression of the MS1 gene program. We validated the requirement for these two cytokines to induce the MS1 gene program through CRISPR-Cas9 editing of their receptors in HSPCs. Using this cellular model system, we demonstrated that induced MS1 cells were broadly immunosuppressive and showed decreased responsiveness to stimulation with a synthetic RNA analog. Our in vitro study suggests a potential role for systemic cytokines in inducing myelopoiesis during severe bacterial or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis or severe COVID-19 induces suppressive myeloid cell production from hematopoietic progenitors in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of corticosteroid treatment on virological course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between corticosteroid and viral clearance in COVID-19. The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from 10 hospitals of Jiangsu, China, were retrospectively collected. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to analyze the adverse factors of virus clearance. Of the 309 COVID-19 patients, eighty-nine (28.8%) patients received corticosteroid treatment during hospitalization. Corticosteroid group showed higher C-reactive protein (median 11.1 vs. 7.0 mg/l, P = 0.018) and lower lymphocytes (median 0.9 vs. 1.4  109/l, P < 0.001) on admission. Fever (93.3% vs. 65.0%, P < 0.001) and cough (69.7% vs. 57.3%, P = 0.043) were more common in corticosteroid group. The proportions of patients with severe illness (34.8% vs. 1.8%, P < 0.001), respiratory failure (25.8% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (4.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.002), and admission to ICU (20.2% vs. 0.9%, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in corticosteroid group than non-corticosteroid group. The duration of virus clearance (median 18.0 vs. 16.0 days, P < 0.001) and hospitalization (median 17.0 vs. 15.0 days, P < 0.001) were also significantly longer in corticosteroid group than non-corticosteroid group.

As DIs can directly or indirectly alter propagation kinetics of the parental virus, they offer a novel approach to antiviral therapy, capitalizing on knowledge from natural infection. However, efforts to translate in vitro inhibition to in vivo screening models remain limited. We investigated the efficacy of virus-like particles containing DI genomes (therapeutic infectious particles [TIPs]) in the Syrian hamster model of lethal Nipah virus (NiV) disease. We found that coadministering a high dose of TIPs intraperitoneally with virus challenge improved clinical course and reduced lethality. To mimic natural exposure, we also evaluated lower-dose TIP delivery and virus challenge intranasally, finding equally efficacious reduction in disease severity and overall lethality. Eliminating TIP replicative capacity decreased efficacy, suggesting protection via direct inhibition. These data provide evidence that TIP-mediated treatment can confer protection against disease and lethal outcome in a robust animal NiV model, supporting further development of TIP treatment for NiV and other high-consequence pathogens.","output":"Defective Interfering Viral Particle Treatment Reduces Clinical Signs and Protects Hamsters from Lethal Nipah Virus Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forest fires impact on soil, water and biota resources has been widely researched. Although forest fires profoundly impact the atmosphere and air quality across the ecosystems, much less research has been developed to examine its impact on the current pandemic. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to examine the effects of the 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus (COVID 19) casualties. The spatiotemporal concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to October 30 for 2020 (fire year) and 2019 (reference year). Both spatial (Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and non spatial (negative binomial regression) regression analysis was performed to assess the adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The in situ data led measurements showed that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were clustered in the West Coastal fire-prone states during the August 1 to October 30 period. The average concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 were increased in all the fire states affected badly by forest fires. The average PM2.5 concentration over the period was recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and 5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in 2019, which was increased up to 24.9, 13.4, 25, and 17 in 2020. Both spatial and non-spatial regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between fire emission and COVID 19 incidents. A total of 30 models were developed for analyzing the spatial non-stationary and local association between the predictor and response factors. All these spatial models have demonstrated a statistically significant association between fire emissions and COVID counts.

It presents a case study of covert transediting in the Shanghai Observer, i.e., a journalistic opinion that interweaves Chinese renderings of selected excerpts from four British and American media texts. With an integrated approach to travelling memory (Erll, Astrid. 2011. Travelling memory. Parallax 17(4). 4C18) via transediting, our analysis shows that the transeditor does not only choose source texts in terms of media and content, but also selectively reframes the Spanish flu memory for lesson learning in conjunction with the mainstream Chinese discourse and practice of COVID-19 control. It unveils how the Great Influenza is thus transculturally remembered in more simplified and ideologically agreeable manners through omission, summary translation, and transformation, while faithful transference is not sheerly dispensed. We contend that transcultural remembrance via transediting is a purposive, socio-culturally shaped practice involving interrelations and interactions of manifold factors, and we need a more complex approach to the politics of memory in translation. Journalistic translation, which is mostly covert and transediting, is among different genres of translation that shape transcultural memory;more research in their interplay is called for.

Numerous studies have revealed the existence of significant associations between certain HLA alleles and the susceptibility and prognosis of different infectious diseases. In this pilot study we analyse the binding affinity between 66 class I HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides, and its association with the severity of the disease. A total of 45 Spanish patients with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were typed for HLA class I; after that, we analysed if an in silico model of HLA I-viral peptide binding affinity and classical HLA supertypes could be correlated to the severity of the disease. Our results suggest that patients with mild disease present Class I HLA molecules with a higher theoretical capacity for binding SARS-Cov-2 peptides and showed greater heterozygosity when comparing them with moderate and severe groups. In this regard, identifying HLA-SARS-CoV-2 peptides binding differences between individuals would help to clarify the heterogeneity of clinical responses to the disease and will also be useful to guide a personalized treatment according to its particular risk.","output":"Possible role of HLA class-I genotype in SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression: A pilot study in a cohort of Covid-19 Spanish patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic still poses a threat to the global population, and is a public health challenge that needs to be overcome. Now more than ever, action is needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy, especially in light of the availability of effective and safe vaccines. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on a representative random sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region, in Italy, in January 2021. The questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, comorbidities, past vaccination refusal, COVID-19-related experiences, risk perception of infection, and likelihood to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple logistic regression analyses and classification tree analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy and to distinguish groups with different levels of hesitancy. Overall, 31.1% of the sample reported hesitancy. Past vaccination refusal was the key discriminating variable followed by perceived risk of infection. Other significant predictors of hesitancy were: ages between 35 and 54 years, female gender, low educational level, low income, and absence of comorbidities. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine involved safety (54%) and efficacy (27%).

For others, designing integrated STEM curriculum has the potential to address issues students and teachers currently face in understanding the potential of the STEM subjects to solve many of the worlds problems and, in so doing, engage and enthuse students to want to continue the study of the STEM disciplines into the future. The contributions to this book highlight the potential of integrated STEM curriculum to engage students and support teachers professional learning, but they also raise questions and challenge our thinking. While the case studies provide rich examples of the ways researchers are working with teachers and students to develop and implement integrated STEM curriculum, is this sufficient to address the future needs of all students in an ever-complex world?

A main drawback of using IEX for NOM removal is the production of spent IEX regeneration brine, a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge. In this work, we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent NOM-rich brine, with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt. Compared to polymeric nanofiltration, the fouling was limited. When NOM is rejected and concentrated, a clean permeate with the regeneration salt (NaCl) could be produced and reused in the IEX regeneration process. Bench scale studies revealed that NOM could be effectively separated from the NaCl solution by steric effects. However, the separation of NaCl from other salts present in the brine, such as Na2SO4, was not sufficient for reuse purposes. The low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine. The permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange. Further treatment steps will benefit from the removal of NOM from the brine.","output":"Separating NOM from salts in ion exchange brine with ceramic nanofiltration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An accurate and efficient forecasting system is imperative to the prevention of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in public health.

First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use.

DESIGN Prospective radiographic cohort study of seasonal chocolate figurines, supplemented by anonymous 5-item questionnaire survey of belief in the re-wrapping myth (Generic Risk Items Noted by Chocolate consumers in Health care settings; GRINCH). SETTING Two tertiary referral trauma centres in Germany (Berlin and Duisburg). PARTICIPANTS Eighteen chocolate Easter Bunnies and 15 chocolate Santa Clauses from different manufacturers purchased during 2020; 502 randomly selected people passing through the entrance halls of the two hospitals during 16 September - 12 October 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Whole body computed tomography (WBCT) images of chocolate Easter Bunnies and Santa Clauses assessed by four independent, board-certified radiologists using a visual contour resemblance scale (CRS); survey participants' views on statements related to the re-wrapping myth. RESULTS Expert examiners clearly distinguished the WBCT images of chocolate Easter Bunnies and Santa Clauses; the mean difference in CRS was 84.2 points (95% CI, 78.5-90.0 points), with excellent inter-observer agreement (mean intra-class correlation coefficient, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00). A total of 214 survey participants (43%) disagreed and 145 (29%) agreed with the proposition that seasonal chocolate figurines are re-packaged and re-sold the following season. CONCLUSION Although about one-third of our survey respondents did not rule out the possibility of seasonal sweets being re-used, WBCT imaging found no similarity between chocolate foil-wrapped Easter and Christmas figurines, providing solid evidence against this urban myth.

Monoclonal antibody reagents that recognise specific antigens on SARS-CoV are needed urgently. In this report, the development and immunochemical characterisation of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV is presented, based upon their specificity, binding requirements, and biological activity. Initial screening by ELISA, using highly purified virus as the coating antigen, resulted in the selection of 103 mAbs to the SARS virus. Subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen IgG mAbs. A single mAb, F26G15, is specific for the nucleoprotein as seen in Western immunoblot while five other mAbs react with the Spike protein. Two of these Spike-specific mAbs demonstrate the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro while another four Western immunoblot-negative mAbs also neutralise the virus. The utility of these mAbs for diagnostic development is demonstrated. Antibody from convalescent SARS patients, but not normal human serum, is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mAbs to whole SARS-CoV. These studies highlight the importance of using standardised assays and reagents. These mAbs will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests, studies of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and vaccine development.","output":"Development and characterisation of neutralising monoclonal antibody to the SARS-coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Australia's planning and preparedness for a health emergency response has served us well in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic Despite this, rapid and agile decisions were required to manage the public health impact In the face of uncertainty and the seemingly evolving nature of the virus, we have seen precautionary actions and outcomes beyond that articulated in planning The timely closure of international borders, requiring 14-day quarantine of returning travellers in designated facilities, is one such outcome;yet potentially the single most effective measure in controlling the pandemic in Australia Our testing strategy, case and contact management, social restrictions and community measures have successfully suppressed the virus to a level of no domestic community transmission The framework for this success was the effective utilisation of existing public health committees, whole of government leadership and responsiveness at all levels and community support With the impending commencement of the COVID-19 vaccine program, this framework continues to support navigating our way out of the pandemic","output":"Responding to the pandemic at a national and state public health level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article assesses the CORE Group Polio Project (CGPP) experience over a 20-year period in 5 countries.

METHODS: We reviewed 15 patients with positive anti-ganglioside antibodies in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2016 to 2019. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the study (mean age, 54.4 years; age range, 27 to 80 years; 9 men (60%)). Ten patients presented with a history of preinfection, including flu-like syndrome (n = 6, 60%), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (n = 3, 30%), and digestive tract infection (GI) (n = 1, 10%). The most common manifestation was ophthalmoplegia (n = 13, 86.67%), followed by weakness (n = 12, 80%), ataxia (n = 11, 73.3%), paresthesia (n = 8, 53.33%) and hypersomnolence (n = 5, 33.33%). All 15 patients underwent antibody testing. Eight patients (53.33%, 7 men (87.5%)) of whom only have positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) against anti-GQ1b antibody while seven (46.67%, 2 men (28.57%)) were positive for multiple anti-ganglioside antibodies apart from anti-GQ1b antibodies.

Materials and Methods: A total of 314 dental students participated in this cross-sectional study. Data were collected using a validated self-reported questionnaire to measure teledentistry awareness, attitude, practices, and barriers to teledentistry. The study was approved by Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia. Results: Only 17.2% were aware of the term 'teledentistry.' However, after it was explained, participants were able to correctly answer 25.16%-62.42% of items about teledentistry. A total of 67.83% would practice teledentistry, and 70.7% support using teledentistry on a national scale for Vision 2030. Only 25.16% used teledentistry before, but 56.05% did dental consultations via smartphone. The most common barriers were patient satisfaction requiring a dentist's physical presence, violation of patient privacy, and low levels of population education.

Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) plays an important role in reducing mitochondrial-derived oxidative stress and could, therefore, have therapeutic potential in these patients. OBJECTIVES: We used primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from asthmatics and healthy controls to evaluate: a) protein levels of Paraoxonase 2 and b) to test the potential protective effect of quercetin supplementation in cells under oxidative stress conditions. RESULTS: Compared to lean controls, obese asthmatics had significantly lower PON2 airway epithelial levels (respectively, 1.08 vs. 0.47 relative units normalized by GAPDH) (p-value < 0.006). Treating HBECs in vitro for 24 hrs. with 25M quercetin significantly increased PON2 protein levels: 15.5 treated cells vs. 9.8 untreated cells (relative units normalized by GAPDH) (p value = 0.004). Notably, compared to untreated cells, quercetin supplementation reduces mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production on HBECs cells exposed to different oxidative stress triggers such as 1-2 Naphthoquinone (1-2 NQ) and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that PON2 might play a protective role ameliorating oxidative injury on human airway epithelium. CONCLUSION: Compared to lean controls, obese asthmatics have significantly reduced PON2 levels in airway epithelial cells. Treatment with quercetin in vitro increased PON2 protein levels and prevented oxidative stress from different types of stimuli. Hence, quercetin supplementation may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity-mediated airway oxidative stress in obese asthmatics.","output":"Airway epithelial Paraoxonase-2 in obese asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High sodium intake has been considered as the leading dietary risk factor for deaths and disability-adjusted life-years among older adults.

By measuring nasalCnasopharynx pressure at maximum flow, we established a cut-off value at which nasal breathing can be differentiated from combined mouth breathing in COD patients. We found that increased nasal resistance led to mouth breathing and that the velocity and flow rate in the olfactory cleft at maximum flow were significantly reduced in COD patients with nasal breathing only compared to healthy olfactory subjects.

This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying patterns related to post-traumatic symptoms by considering personality and defensive styles. Specifically, it was hypothesized that neuroticism was negatively associated with impact of event, as opposed to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness traits. The mediation role of mature, neurotic, and immature defenses in these relationships was also investigated. This study involved 557 Italian individuals (71.3% women, 28.7% men; Mage = 34.65, SD = 12.05), who completed an online survey including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) and Ten Item Personality Inventory. Results showed a nonsignificant effect for extraversion and openness on impact of event. The negative influence of neuroticism was instead confirmed in a partial parallel mediation involving significant effects from immature and neurotic defenses in the indirect path. Finally, agreeableness and conscientiousness delineated two protective pathways regarding impact of event, determining two total parallel mediation models in which both these personality traits were negatively associated with immature defensive styles, and conscientiousness was also positively related to mature defenses.

This highlights the need to better understand what factors influence young people to use contraception. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between the perception of peers use of contraceptives and contraceptive use and method choice among young men and women in Kenya. METHODS: This study utilizes a nationally representative sample of women and men aged 15C24 years from the 2018 and 2019 cross sectional Shujaaz State of the Kenyan Youth annual surveys. Among the sample of sexually experienced young people (59%), multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the association between the perception of peers use of contraceptives and the respondents contraceptive method choice: non-user, condom use or use of any other modern method. Results are presented separately for young men and young women. RESULTS: Our results show that sexually experienced young men and women who perceive that their peers are using contraceptives are more likely to report current use of condoms compared to being a nonuser (RRR = 2.12, p < 0.001, RRR = 2.59, p < 0.001, respectively); they are also more likely to use condoms than another modern method of contraception (RRR = 2.13, p = 0.034, RRR = 1.71, p = 0.014, respectively). Young women are more likely to use another modern method (not including condoms) than be a nonuser when they perceive that their peers use contraceptives (RRR = 1.51, p = 0.020).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a nationwide retrospective analysis using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2016. We identified patients who received CVC within 30 days from hospital admission. We compared the 30-day mortality between two groups: patients who received CVC within two days (early) after admission and those who received CVC three or more days (delayed) after admission, using marginal structural models with inverse probability treatment weighting.

By ELISA, polyclonal sera exhibited high background reactions that could be significantly reduced by treatment with kaolin in the case of rabbit sera. Attempts to establish an ELISA for BEC antigen detection based on polyclonal sera failed due to low sensitivity and specificity. Optimal results were achieved when a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies was coated onto microplates for antigen capture, while rabbit hyperimmune serum served as detecting antibodies in an indirect assay.

Although stroke is known to occur in these patients, an accurate estimate of stroke incidence is lacking. We aimed to determine the incidence of stroke and death in patients with HF, comparing Chagas and non-Chagas etiologies. METHODS Cohort of stroke-free patients with HF (Framingham criteria) followed in a university-based outpatient clinic in Brazil. Baseline characteristics included sociodemographic, risk factor assessment, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings. Chagas disease was defined by appropriate serologic tests. Cause-specific Cox regression was used to search for predictors of stroke or death as separate outcomes. RESULTS We studied 565 patients with HF between January 2003 and December 2018, mean age 54.3 ? 12.9 years, 305 (54.0%) female, 271/535 (50.7%) with Chagas disease. Chagas patients were older (55.5 vs 53.1 years), more frequently women (60.5% vs 47.3%), less frequently harbored coronary artery disease (14.5% vs 34.1%) when compared to non-Chagas patients. Echocardiography showed more severe disease among non-Chagas patients [median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) 37.3% vs 47.0%]. Over a mean 42.9 (? 34.4) months, we followed 404 (71.5%) patients, completing 1442 patient-years of follow-up. Stroke incidence was higher in Chagas when compared to non-Chagas patients (20.2 vs 13.9 events per 1000 patient-years), while death rate was similar (41.6 vs 43.1 deaths per 1000 patient-years). In the multivariable analysis for stroke outcome adjusted for LVEF and arrhythmias, cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) for Chagas was 2.54 (95% confidence interval 1.01 a 6.42, p=0.048). Chagas disease was also associated with increased risk of death (CSHR 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.04 a 3.24, p=0.037). CONCLUSION Chagas disease is associated with increased risk of stroke and death when compared to other etiologies of HF, independently of HF severity or cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting other factors contribute to increased stroke risk and mortality in Chagas disease.

Thirty-three members from 23 institutions were divided into working groups and given 3 weeks to develop 10 modules based on urologic subspecialties, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, technical skills training and student assessment. Working groups were encouraged to develop innovative learning approaches. The final curriculum was assembled into the vSIU Guidebook. RESULTS: The vSIU Guidebook contains 212 pages C 64 pages core content and 2 appendices (patient cases and evaluations). It outlines a detailed 4-week curriculum with a sufficient volume of resources to offer a completely adaptable virtual course with the same rigor as a traditional subinternship. Modules contain curated teaching resources including journal articles, lectures, surgical videos and simulated clinical scenarios. Innovative learning tools include reflective writing, mentorship guidelines, videoconference-based didactics, surgical simulcasting and virtual technical skills training. The guidebook was disseminated to program directors nationally. NEXT STEPS: The vSIU is the first virtual subinternship in any specialty to be standardized and offered nationally, and it was implemented by at least 19 urology programs. This curriculum serves as a template for other specialties looking to develop virtual programs and feedback from educators and students will allow the curriculum to evolve. As the pandemic continues to challenge our paradigm, this rapid and innovative response exemplifies that the medical community will continue to meet the needs of an ever-changing educational landscape.","output":"Changing the Status Quo: Developing a Virtual Sub-Internship in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the unfolding of the plastic scintillator spectrum was undertaken using the artificial neural networks tools of MATLAB.

Result confidence decreases with low viral load because near the assays limit of detection (LOD), test results may alternate between positive and negative, as characterized by Poisson distribution for target analytes at low density. Low positive results may indicate past infection, early infection, a vaccinated individual with low level viral shed, or a false-positive result. EUA methods provide guidance on test interpretation, but laboratories should assess clinical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical accuracy of specimens with low positive results. METHODS/CASE REPORT: Respiratory specimens were tested by Cepheid Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay with positive results up to a Ct of 45. A low positive (defined as Ct 35), which could not be confirmed by Hologic Aptima? SARS-CoV-2 assay was reported as indeterminate and repeat testing recommended. Repeat testing occurred by Cepheid, Hologic, BioFire, Roche, or Quest assays. Retrospectively, final results were extracted from the LIS (Epic Beaker, Madison, WI, version May 2020) for 5-months (12/1/2020 to 5/31/2021), and chart review performed. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): A total of 19,969 tests were performed; 10.4% (n=2,083) were positive, 89% (n=17,728) negative, and 0.79% (n=158) indeterminate. Previous infection (up to 3 months prior) was documented in 18% (n=28) of indeterminate results and defined as true positive. Of remaining indeterminate results, 43% (n=68) had repeat testing as recommended by laboratory; 26% (n=18) were positive and 74% (n=50) were negative. The average number of days between indeterminate and negative result was 7.25 (range 1-38). CONCLUSION: Result discordance occurred in < 1% of all samples, excellent agreement. For low positive samples, discordance was higher, as expected. Its impossible to determine if negative results from the 50 repeat samples were false-positive by Cepheid or false-negative by other methods. In summary, 32% (50/158) of indeterminant samples did not repeat as positive. Overall concordance was high and results fluctuate when low virus is present. In absence of symptoms, we conclude repeat testing is not routinely recommended. Laboratories must recognize that normal variability occurs near assay LOD and must critically assess performance against other methods with similar LODs to fully assess performance of EUA methods.","output":"Evaluation of indeterminate SARS-CoV-2 results with repeat testing on an alternative platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused many hospitals and treatment centers to temporarily restrict or prohibit visitors to control viral spread.

Over the past decades, Singapore has faced threats caused by the SARS Coronavirus, Influenza, Dengue, and Chikungunya viruses, just to name a few. To understand the viral pathogenicity as well as control and prevention of the infections, a high containment has been applied for the research of high biorisk pathogens. Here, a standard precaution has been established to remove an inactivated virus samples to low biosafety environment as a business continuous strategy. An inactivate protocol is divided into two parts, inactivation and validation. Inactivation is a strategy completely remove the virus infectivity, included physical and chemical methods, e.g. heat and methanol. Validation shall be a solid method to reveal inactivation part was sufficient to inactivate virus and the samples still able to carry out for downstream experiments. Methods and materials: Stability of virus was performed in different temperatures. The virus cultures were aliquot into 200 uL and incubated from 5 mins up to 2 weeks in -80 C, 4 C, room temperature, 37 C, and 95 C. Cell lines infected by virus was fixed by 100% cold methanol for 15 mins, then washed and harvested for validation. To extract viral genome, an infected cells or virus cultures was treated by lysis buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate. All treated samples were used to cultivate for at least 3 days to validate it has no virus CPE. For safety precaution, a witness is required to monitor the inactivation process. Results: By an in-principle approval protocol, the Mayaro virus (MAYV), for example, was certified to inactivate by using 95 C for 5 mins, 100% cold methanol for 15 mins, and lysis buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate for 5 mins. However, the infectivity of MAYV was started dropping after 24 hrs in 37 C and 7 days in room temperature. It was no infectivity after 72 hrs in 37 C. Conclusion: In conclusion, to remove a high biorisk samples to low biosafety environment for downstream experiments may expose to the risk and to cause laboratory-acquired infections.

The research project aims to identify and analyze changes in medical presentations and disease severity within the ED at Hurley Medical Center (HMC) in Flint, Michigan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The present study is a retrospective chart review on HMCs ED encounters focusing on adults 18 years and above in Flint/Genesee County in Michigan. Data collected for the study was obtained from patient charts from February 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019 and from February 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Data from 2019 versus 2020 was analyzed using a combination of independent t-test, chi-square analysis, and regression modeling. Results: There were a total of 59,345 visits analyzed within the study;33,648 ED visits within the study were in 2019 compared to 25,697 visits in 2020. There was a significant difference in patient sex between 2019 and 2020 with a larger percentage of males presenting in 2020 vs 2019 (p<0.001). Furthermore, the ICD-10 diagnosis differed between 2019 and 2020 with significant increase in the percentage of infectious disease, COVID-19, generalized symptoms, pneumonia, respiratory failure/insufficiency/arrest, patients with socioeconomic factors, mental health, nausea/vomiting, patients with history or family history of chronic disease, disorders of lipid metabolism, and myocardial infarction presentations in 2020 compared to 2019. Dispositions also significantly differed in 2020 compared to 2019 with more patients receiving admission or dying in the ED (p<0.001). Patients who presented to the ED often presented with more severe illness in 2020 as reflected in increased length of stay in 2020 (p=0.01) and increased case-medical-index (p<0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the total number of ED visits to HMC in Flint, Michigan in 2020, when compared to the same time period in 2019. Notably, patients were more likely to have a longer length-of-stay, present with more severe illness, and more likely to be admitted or pass away in the ED when compared to the same time period in 2019. Analysis also revealed that visits for respiratory diagnoses and other life-threatening conditions like myocardial infarction increased, whereas less life-threatening/acute conditions like sprains, urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted infections decreased. Interestingly as well, the pandemic drove statistically significant increased visits for mental health and socioeconomic factors. Limitations include analyzing 6 months of data as opposed to the whole calendar year and the use of broad ICD-10 code categories.

Designing a reconstruction procedure with safety blood supply to a large volume soft tissue and resulting in minimal trauma is a priority for surgeons. Methods: The free-style perforators on the potential donor sites surrounding the ulcers were detected by Doppler, and the area of the ulcer was divided into several sections based on the location of pre-design perforator flaps. According to the insertion point of the perforators, small V-Y advancement flaps, propeller flaps and rotation flaps pedicled with freestyle perforators were formed and moderately modified during surgery. All of the small flaps were transplanted from donor sites to the defect and reassembled into a new composite flap to repair the ulcer. The donor sites were directly closed. The area of the flaps ranged from 7.0  10.5 cm to 8.0  22.0 cm and the diameter of the pedicle perforators ranged from 0.5 to 4.0 mm. Results: In 30 patients, 65 flaps were constructed, and all of the flaps survived with direct closure of all donor sites. One case with effusion healed 1 month postoperatively through draining and application of a mild pressure dressing. After a 3-24 months follow-up period, all of the patients were satisfied with post-operative function and appearance, and only one case had a local recurrence 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: The jigsaw puzzle flap based on freestyle perforators can repair the large skin and soft tissue defects caused by decubitus ulcers on the buttocks, with direct donor flap area closure.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We registered data from renal transplant recipients with SARS-COVID infection in our area during a year (March 2020-2021). We collected demographics, comorbidity, body mass index, lymphocyte count and vitamin D level before the diagnosis. We performed statistical analysis using SSPS.20. RESULTS Of 63 patients, 57.1% required hospital admission and 14.3% intensive care. The incidence of acute renal failure was 28.6%. 34.9% developed hyperinflammatory syndrome. 67% had lymphopenia, which was severe in 13.1%. Eleven patients died. There was significant correlation between lymphocyte count before and during the infection. For hospitalization, we found differences in age, pulmonary disease and renal function. For admission in an intensive care unit the related factors were obesity, severe lymphopenia, altered renal function and low level of vitamin D. According mortality, the predictors were age, renal function and minimum lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS - In kidney transplant recipients with COVID infection, renal function determines hospitalization, and body mass index the admission in an intensive care unit. Previous vitamin D level also looks significantly lower in patients requiring intensive care. - The analysis of lymphocyte count previous to infection is correlated with the minimum level during the disease, which is a predictor of mortality, and that could be a prognosis factor.","output":"RISK OF SEVERE COVID-19 INFECTION IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The whole world is now facing an unprecedented pandemic with over 1.8 million confirmed cases and more than one hundred thousand deaths.

This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of April 18, COVID-19 cases have been found in 53 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-five percent of the cases have been identified in 5 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Narayanganj, followed by Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh and Barishal. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 4, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57% rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis.

Scores were assigned on the basis of patient history in a basic model, and a full model additionally incorporated radiological and laboratory results. The main outcome measure was death. RESULTS Predictors for mortality in the basic model included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Additional predictors in the full model included haziness or infiltrates on chest radiography, less than 95% oxygen saturation on room air, high lactate dehydrogenase level, and high neutrophil and low platelet counts. The basic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.860 in the derivation cohort, which was maintained on external validation with an area under the ROC curve of 0.882.

Moreover, the additional beneficial effect from the addition of corroborants of plant origin such as 3% soy lecithin and 5% flavonoid-rich wood glycolic extract to WD (BF) was investigated. Moreover, the possible toxicological concern from some potentially toxic elements (PTEs), namely Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn, which may be abundant in WD was verified. After four weeks, we found that 0.25% WD not only increases lettuce biomass, which has an economic value, but also has beneficial effects on other qualitative parameters such as sugars and total sweetness. On the other hand, the use of 0.5% WD decreased the content of soluble sugars, suggesting a hormetic-type effect. We did not find evidence of further beneficial effects from the addition to WD of plant-derived corroborants, nor of any enrichment in the content of the investigated PTEs.","output":"Bio-Based Solutions for Agriculture: Foliar Application of Wood Distillate Alone and in Combination with Other Plant-Derived Corroborants Results in Different Effects on Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we suggest a real-time online shopper behavior prediction system which predicts the visitors shopping intent as soon as the website is visited.

The number of patients confirmed by the Covid-19 virus receiving treatment at hospitals in Indonesia has increased significantly. This condition causes increased fatigue that can lead to higher stress on nurses. Low serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were found in workers with high-stress levels. This stress is triggered by several factors such as sleep disturbances, workload, and conflicts that occur in the workplace. Method: This research used an analytic observational method with a cross-sectional design during July-September 2020 at the Cempaka Putih Islamic Hospital Jakarta, in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. A sample of 89 nurses recruited by the purposive sampling technique who met the inclusion criteria obtained, namely not having a systemic disorder, not suffering from psychiatric disorders, not consuming alcohol, and not smoking. The data were collected using anthropometric measurements and intravenous blood collection to check BDNF gene mRNA expression using real-time PCR. Results: The results showed that the mean BDNF levels on respondents with low, medium, and high-stress levels were 11.68752, 8.65197, and 7.35583, respectively. There was a significant relationship between shift work (P-Value = 0.007) and stress levels (P-value = 0.000) of nurses and decreased BDNF gene's level during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Under these conditions, at-risk older adults are even more likely to be inactive and isolated, leading to potential exacerbation of musculoskeletal and chronic conditions and emotional distress. This case study provides an overview of our experience and best practices developed during our shift from onsite programming to virtual. Methodology: HSS utilized varied online approaches, including phone/video conference classes, webinars, on-demand videos and email campaigns to successfully transition programs. Due to this shift, HSS changed its evaluation to an online approach, using a mixed method to adequately assess the impact of programs. Results: Between April and August 2020, our virtual programs reached 428,766 participants, resulting in a 10,807% increase in program reach. Most participants assessed were 60 years or older (72%) and reported knowledge (85%) and self-management skills (83%) gained as well as high program satisfaction (90%). Analyses of program data did not show any statistical significant difference in self-reported health outcomes. However, qualitative results showed virtual programming helped to foster social connectivity during COVID-19, helped to build a daily routine, and positively impacted mental and physical health.

A rapid, reliable and specific detection method was urgently needed. Herein, we reported a contamination-free visual detection method for SARS-CoV-2 with LAMP and CRISPR/Cas12a technology. CRISPR/Cas12a reagents were pre-added on the inner wall of the tube lid. After LAMP reaction, CRISPR/Cas12a reagents were flowed into the tube and mixed with amplicon solution by hand shaking, which can effectively avoid possible amplicon formed aerosol contamination caused by re-opening the lid after amplification. CRISPR/Cas12a can highly specific recognize target sequence and discriminately cleave single strand DNA probes (5'-6FAM 3'-BHQ1). With smart phone and portable 3D printing instrument, the produced fluorescence can be seen by naked eyes without any dedicated instruments, which is promising in the point-of-care detection. The whole amplification and detection process could be completed within 40 min with high sensitivity of 20 copies RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This reaction had high specificity and could avoid cross-reactivity with other common viruses such as influenza virus. For 7 positive and 3 negative respiratory swab samples provided by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, our detection results had 100% positive agreement and 100% negative agreement, which demonstrated the accuracy and application prospect of this method.","output":"Contamination-free visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 with CRISPR/Cas12a: A promising method in the point-of-care detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced most institutions of higher education to offer instruction and activities offsite, impacting millions of people.

Methods: This study was a multicenter, retrospective study conducted in eight IBD referral centers located in the Daegu-Kyungpook province. Children and adolescents of 18 years who were initially diagnosed with IBD between 2017 and 2020 were included. The annual number of children and adolescents newly diagnosed with IBD and the annual resident population of children and adolescents 18 years of age in the Daegu-Kyungpook province were investigated to calculate the annual incidence and prevalence in the region.

During 2020, in anticipation of a vaccine to slow the spread of disease, local and state governments in the United States developed plans for vaccine prioritization, given a limited initial supply. Recognizing the challenges inherent in prioritization, the New York City (NYC) health department sought guidance from members of the public about the fairest approach to early-stage vaccine distribution. OBJECTIVE To solicit recommendations from NYC residents on priorities regarding vaccine access for essential worker occupations, considering risk factors and preferred approaches to fairness. IMPLEMENTATION Five public deliberations were conducted with NYC residents (N = 91). Participants heard presentations on the COVID-19 vaccine, the local distribution of illness and death, and approaches to fairness in the context of deliberating on priorities for 6 essential worker occupations and 4 risk factors. Discussions were transcribed, and transcriptions were coded and analyzed using preidentified and emergent themes. Pre- and post-surveys, focused on factors relevant to prioritization, were administered during each public deliberation. RESULTS Recommendations for prioritization emphasized risk of severe morbidity and mortality, and work and neighborhood conditions with fewer protections (eg, in-person work, exposure to many people). Participants prioritized elementary schoolteachers, grocery store workers, and bus drivers, underlying health conditions, and neighborhood of residence. Participants focused on equity, recognizing that those at highest risk were largely low-income populations of color and individuals living in low-resourced neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS Participants' focus on equity, and acknowledgment of racial and ethnic disparities, revealed a nuanced understanding of the broader determinants of health. Recommendations reinforced the NYC health department's approach to vaccine distribution.

We then estimate a more general multi-country model augmented with these threshold effects as well as long term interest rates, oil prices, exchange rates and equity returns to perform counterfactual analyses.

The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic implications of WBC and cell population data (CPD) abnormalities related to COVID-19 at disease onset. METHODS: Baseline WBC counts and CPD data were analyzed in one hundred COVID-19 patients presenting to emergency department and subsequently discharged (n = 49), admitted (n = 51) or deceased (n = 22), and in 47 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were observed in all COVID-19 patients, with more intensity in the admitted and deceased groups, that also presented increased WBC and neutrophil counts. On CPD analysis, COVID-19 was associated with increased volume of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, whereas conductivity was decreased for neutrophils and increased for lymphocytes. The ROC curve analysis showed good performance for lymphocyte counts in predicting COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.858), for neutrophil counts in predicting admission for COVID-19 (AUC = 0.744) and for monocytes volume in predicting COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.837).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and validate a computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Twelve 4CE sites participated. First we developed an EHR-based severity phenotype consisting of six code classes, and we validated it on patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also piloted an alternative machine-learning approach and compared selected predictors of severity to the 4CE phenotype at one site. RESULTS: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of individual code categories for acuity had high variability - up to 0.65 across sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean AUC 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921), compared to AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) for the machine-learning approach. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with as low as 49% precision and recall compared to chart review. DISCUSSION: We developed a severity phenotype using 6 code classes that proved resilient to coding variability across international institutions. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold-standard outcomes, possibly due to heterogeneous pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: We developed an EHR-based severity phenotype for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and validated it at 12 international sites.","output":"Validation of an Internationally Derived Patient Severity Phenotype to Support COVID-19 Analytics from Electronic Health Record Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a significant impact on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) services.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Foals (n = 65). METHODS Medical records (2010-2015) of foals up to 1 month of age, surgically treated for an umbilical infection were reviewed. Short-term (at the time of discharge from hospital) and long-term (1 year after surgery) survival rates were obtained. Clinical variables influencing survival were assessed. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the relationship between the data retrieved and outcome. P  .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Sixty-five foals were included in the study, representing 17.2% of all foals admitted to the hospital. Fifty foals were discharged from hospital (77%) and 43 foals (66%) were alive 1 year after surgery. Lower long-term survival rates were associated with: younger age at presentation, septic joints, multiple pathologies, higher creatinine level, higher heart rate, umbilical infection diagnosed at the hospital rather than prior to referral, prolonged hospitalization, longer period between arrival and surgery, and postoperative complications. The most common surgical findings were urachal enlargement followed by right arterial enlargement. CONCLUSION Younger foals with worse systemic condition and concurrent disorders are at higher risk for treatment failure. Early diagnosis improves the outcome.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are significant biomarkers of HIV risk and should trigger preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) discussion. We reviewed STI testing practices outside of sexual health clinics to identify opportunities for improvement in the provision of HIV prevention services. METHODS An electronic sexual health dashboard was used to identify patient encounters with a positive gonorrhea, chlamydia, and/or rapid plasma reagin test result between January 1, 2019, and August 23, 2019, at a large urban academic medical center. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess HIV testing, completeness of STI screening, and HIV prevention discussion; inadequate screening was defined as no HIV test in 12 months before STI diagnosis. RESULTS A total of 815 patients with 856 patient encounters were included. Patients were predominantly female (64.4%); median age was 24 years (range, 18-85 years). The most common test and most common positive test result was the genitourinary gonorrhea/chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test. Multisite testing was rare (7.5% of patient encounters) and performed more frequently in men than in women (20.3% vs. 0.36%). Women were also more likely to be inadequately screened for HIV (15.1% vs. 25.8%).Documentation of PrEP discussion was rare (4.7% of patient encounters) compared with safe sex (44.6%) and condoms (49.8%). Preexposure prophylaxis was discussed almost exclusively with men compared with women (17% vs. 1.1%).

This results in an offset in the timing of the epidemic among individuals of different blood types, and an increased relative risk to type A/AB patients that is most pronounced during early stages of the epidemic. However, once the majority of any given population is infected, the relative risk to each blood type approaches unity. Published data on COVID-19 prevalence from regions in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suggests that if this model holds true, ABO incompatibility reduces virus transmissibility by at least 60%. Exploring the implications of this model for vaccination strategies shows that paradoxically, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A/AB or super-spreader type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity amongst the remaining susceptible individuals. Given the good agreement between this model and observational data on disease prevalence, the underlying biochemistry urgently requires experimental investigation.","output":"Modelling suggests ABO histo-incompatibility may substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide-spectrum of non-ionizing, non-visible radiation emitted from the novel 5G network deployment was investigated and found liable to produce effects capable of heating up and altering human body nomenclature.

In the present multi-center study, we aimed to assess the differences underlying this association, and ascertain whether ethnicity also mediates other aspects of COVID-19 like cardiovascular complications. METHODS Data were collected from a mixed-ethnicity UK cohort of 613 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London during the second half of March 2020: 292 were White Caucasian ethnicity, 203 were Asian and 118 were of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. RESULTS Caucasian patients were older (P<0.001) and less likely to have hypertension (P=0.038), while Afro-Caribbean patients had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P<0.001). Asian patients were more likely to present with venous thromboembolic disease (adj.OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.49-11.27, P=0.006). On the other hand, Afro-Caribbean had more heart failure (adj.OR=3.64, 95% CI 1.50-8.84, P=0.004) and myocardial injury (adj.OR=2.64, 95% CI 1.10-6.35, P=0.030). Importantly, our adjusted multi-variate Cox regression analysis revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality both for Asian (adj.HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.23-2.91, P=0.004) and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity (adj.HR=2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.37, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Our data show that COVID-19 may have different presentations and follow different clinical trajectories depending on the ethnicity of the affected subject. Awareness of complications more likely to arise in specific ethnicities will allow a more timely diagnosis and preventive measures for patients at risk. Due to increased mortality, individuals of Afro-Caribbean and Asian ethnicity should be considered as high-risk groups. This may have an impact on health-resource allocation and planning, definition of vulnerable groups, disease management, and the protection of healthcare workers at the frontline.","output":"Ethnicity and COVID-19 cardiovascular complications: a multi-center UK cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The expression of autoantigens on murine cortical brain cells and their first appearance during development was studied.

It is currently unknown whether programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade therapy affects severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity on the basis of no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter. Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status. After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. PD-1 blockade does not appear to affect the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: A key question in oncology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is whether PD-1 blockade therapy affects COVID-19 severity. Our analysis of patients with lung cancers supports the safety of PD-1 blockade treatment to achieve optimal cancer outcomes.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.","output":"Impact of PD-1 Blockade on Severity of COVID-19 in Patients with Lung Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confirmed Case Data have been widely cited during the current COVID-19 pandemic as an estimate of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, their central role in media, official reports and decision-making may be undeserved and misleading. Previously published Infection Fatality Rates were weighted by age structure in the 50 countries with more reported deaths to obtain country-specific rates. For each country, the number of infections up to the Infection Date (23 days ago = Incubation Period + Onset to Death period) and the present percentage of immune population were estimated using Infection Fatality Rate, the number of reported deaths (which is less prone to undersampling), and projecting back to Infection Date. We then estimated a Detection Index for each country as the percentage of estimated infections that confirmed cases represent. Assuming that detection remains constant after Infection Date, we estimated the number of deaths and the estimated percentage of the population of each country expected to be immune up to 23 days into the future. Estimated Infection Fatality Rates are higher in Europe. In most countries, confirmed cases currently represent less than 30% of estimated infections on Infection Date, and this value decreases with time. Countries with flat curves throughout the pandemic show the lowest immunity percentages and these values seem unlikely to change in the near future, suggesting that they remain vulnerable to new outbreaks. Estimates for some countries with low Infection Fatality Rates suggest a still steep increase in the number of casualties in the next three weeks. Countries that did not control initial outbreaks seem to have reached higher immunity percentages, although mostly still under 5%.

Not all studies have observed such relationships, however. Differences in study outcomes may be due to methodological limitations and the presence of confounding factors within studies such as immigration status and level of education. We conducted the first systematic review with meta-analysis combining cross-sectional studies to explore if bilingualism might delay symptom onset and diagnosis of dementia, AD, and MCI. Primary outcomes included the age of symptom onset, the age at diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and the risk of developing MCI or dementia. A secondary outcome included the degree of disease severity at dementia diagnosis. There was no difference in the age of MCI diagnosis between monolinguals and bilinguals [mean difference: 3.2; 95% confidence intervals (CI): -3.4, 9.7]. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals reported experiencing AD symptoms 4.7 years (95% CI: 3.3, 6.1) later. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals were diagnosed with dementia 3.3 years (95% CI: 1.7, 4.9) later. Here, 95% prediction intervals showed a large dispersion of effect sizes (-1.9 to 8.5). We investigated this dispersion with a subgroup meta-analysis comparing studies that had recruited participants with dementia to studies that had recruited participants with AD on the age of dementia and AD diagnosis between mono- and bilinguals. Results showed that bilinguals vs. monolinguals were 1.9 years (95% CI: -0.9, 4.7) and 4.2 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.4) older than monolinguals at the time of dementia and AD diagnosis, respectively. The mean difference between the two subgroups was not significant. There was no significant risk reduction (odds ratio: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68-1.16) in developing dementia among bilinguals vs. monolinguals. Also, there was no significant difference (Hedges' g = 0.05; 95% CI: -0.13, 0.24) in disease severity at dementia diagnosis between bilinguals and monolinguals, despite bilinguals being significantly older.

Although findings indicated that bilingualism was on average related to a delayed onset of dementia, the magnitude of this relationship varied across different settings. This variation may be due to unexplained heterogeneity and different sources of bias in the included studies.

In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF; 0.82m MMAD). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF remdesivir formulations are stable after one-month storage at 25 C/60%RH. In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that TFF-remdesivir-leucine was poorly absorbed into systemic circulation while TFF-remdesivir-Captisol? demonstrated increased systemic uptake compared to leucine. Remdesivir was hydrolyzed to the nucleoside analog GS-441524 in lung, and levels of GS-441524 were greater in lung with the leucine formulation compared to Captisol?.

While viral replication and gene expression are significantly impacted by histone modifications on the viral chromatin,(3) studies have shown that some viral pathogens dynamically manipulate cellular epigenetic factors to enhance their own survival and pathogenesis, as well as escape the immune system defense lines.(4) In this dynamic, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) appear to play fundamental roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and recruitment of other factors.(5) Genuinely, those PTMs play a vital role in lytic infection, latency reinforcement, or, conversely, viral reactivation.(6) In this chapter, we will examine and review the involvement of histone modifications as well as their potential manipulation to control infections during various viral life cycle stages, highlighting their prospective implications in the clinical management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV), and other viral diseases.

Students, especially medical sciences students, suffer from more stress as a result of exposure to COVID-induced stressors. It is, therefore, essential to measure mental health and its relationship with social support in medical sciences students during the COVID pandemic. The present study was conducted to determine the mental health status of students and its correlation with social support. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using random sampling on 280 students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2020. Socio-demographic profile scale, Mental Health Test (GHQ-28), and the scale of Perceived Social Support (PRQ-85) were used to collect data. Participants completed the questionnaires online. RESULTS: Considering the potential confounding variables, a general linear model (GLM) was utilized to determine the relationship between mental health and perceived social support. Mean ( standard deviation) of total mental health score 26.5 (12.5) was in the acceptable range of 0-63., and 56% of students suffered from a mental disorder. Mean ( standard deviation) of social support score 128.2 (21.0) ranged from 25 to175. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient, there was a significant inverse correlation between social support score and total mental health score and all its subscales [p < 0.001; r = - 0.294 to - 0.536]. According to the GLM, mental health score decreased significantly with social support score [p = 0.0001; - 0.32 to - 0.20; CI 95%; B = 0.26].

The hypothesis is that CBCT is an accurate and reliable method to measure vertical vestibular and oral bone loss. METHODS: The amount of vertical buccal and oral bone loss (bl) of 260 sites of 10 human cadavers was investigated clinically and radiographically by CBCT. Radiographic measurements were rated by two blinded raters. Measurements and the corresponding differences between clinical and radiological findings are described by medians and quartiles (Q1-Q3). For statistical analysis, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman plots were calculated. RESULTS: The CCC between the raters was 0.994 (95% confidence interval 0.992-0.995). The median bone loss (bl) distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the bony defect (BD) was 3.5a?mm (range 3-5a?mm). The median bl measured in the CBCT was 3.8a?mm (range 3.1-4.8a?mm).

We hypothesized that the estimated cerebral oxy-Hb level, a product of Hb and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), determined at hospital arrival may reflect the level of neuroprotection in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). METHODS The Japan Prediction of neurological Outcomes in patients with Post cardiac arrest (J-POP) registry is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study to test whether rSO2 predicts neurological outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study assessed a subgroup of consecutive patients who fulfilled the J-POP registry criteria and successfully achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from OHCA. The primary outcome measure was the neurological status at 90 days. RESULTS We analyzed data from 495 consecutive comatose survivors who were successfully resuscitated from OHCA, including 119 comatose patients with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC; 24.0%) and 376 cardiac arrests at hospital arrival. In total, 75 patients (15.1%) presented with good neurological outcomes. Univariate analysis revealed that the cerebral oxy-Hb levels were significantly higher in patients with good outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression using the backward elimination method confirmed that the oxy-Hb level was a significant predictor of good neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 1.46). Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) revealed that an oxy-Hb cut-off of 5.5 provided optimal sensitivity and specificity for predicting good neurological outcomes (AUC: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91; sensitivity: 77.3%; specificity: 85.6%). The oxy-Hb level appeared to be an excellent prognostic indicator with significant advantages over rSO2 and base excess according to AUC analysis. The significant trend for good neurological outcomes was consistent, even in the subgroup of patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation upon hospital arrival (1st quartile: 0%; 2nd quartile: 16.7%; 3rd quartile: 29.4%; 4th quartile: 53.3%, P <0.05).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to revise and update the GheOP(3)S-tool. METHODS: Users comments were collected to improve the usability and appropriateness of the original GheOP(3)S-tool, followed by a two-round modified Delphi process according to the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method. This included a literature review, a round zero meeting, a first written round (with 15 international and multidisciplinary experts) and a second face-to-face round (with 11 experts) to change, delete or add GheOP(3)S-criteria. An additional third round with 14 community pharmacists was organised to preserve criteria applicable in the current community pharmacy practice. RESULTS: The updated GheOP(3)S-tool consists of five lists of DRPs and a new addendum containing medications that should be avoided or used with caution in older people with reduced renal function. During the first two rounds, related criteria were grouped, 14 criteria were added and 17 criteria were deleted from the original tool. All criteria were deemed applicable in round 3. This led to a final tool (version 2) with 64 GheOP(3)S-criteria. CONCLUSION: GheOP(3)S-criteria were revised and updated according to experts agreement on their clinical relevance and recent scientific evidence.

The TEACHES-Learning Electronic Module (TEACHES-LEM) is an e-learning platform that was developed to teach opticians to perform TEST. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of TEACHES-LEM with face-to-face training (F2FT) in the training and assessment of knowledge among opticians. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned in this experimental study to receive either the intervention group ((TEACHES-LEM, n = 60) or the control group (F2FT, n = 57). The conceptual knowledge of TEST was assessed with a 20-item clinical scenario-based multiple choice question (MCQ) test before and after teaching (immediately post-teaching and 1-month post-teaching). The MCQ test was developed by three ophthalmologists to give face validity. RESULTS The pre-teaching test scores (TS), indicating prior knowledge, were comparable in both groups (10.02  2.79 versus 10.40  4.17, p = 0.563, independent t test). The mean immediate post teaching score for TEACHES-LEM was 13.3  4.01 versus 12.3  3.29 in the F2FT group (p = 0.170, independent t test). The mean post 1-month teaching score for TEACHES-LEM and F2FT groups were also comparable, 14.5  4.19 versus 13.4  3.90 respectively (p = 0.295, independent t test), indicating non-inferiority of TEACHES to F2FT. CONCLUSION The TEACHES-LEM e-learning tool is as effective as F2FT in teaching opticians to perform TEST. It is an alternative to face-to-face teaching in delivering knowledge and assessment.

This article summarizes the so far available results and publications of these surveys. A total of 1547 psychotherapists took part in the first online survey, which was conducted in the first weeks of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The results showed that psychotherapists increasingly replaced psychotherapy in personal contact with psychotherapy at a distance (telephone or internet) during the lockdown. Increased stress level and job-related worries were mainly reported by psychotherapists who derived all there income from psychotherapy. The experiences with psychotherapy at a distance were described as overall more positive than previously expected. Nonetheless, psychotherapy at a distance was viewed as not 1: 1 comparable to psychotherapy in face-to-face contact. In a second only survey, which was conducted after the first lockdown (summer 2020), 222 Austrian psychotherapists participated. The aim of this survey was to examine the change in treatment format (personal to digital or digital to personal) more closely. At the same time as the second survey, a third online survey was carried out in which 139 patients of the 222 Austrian psychotherapists took part in order to examine the patient's perspective when changing the treatment format. First results show that psychotherapists and patients experienced a difference in terms of the therapeutic interventions used when changing the treatment format. Moreover, the subjective meaning of different areas of life was changed in the COVID-19 pandemic compare to the time before COVID-19. The evaluations to date show that COVID-19 has a significant impact on the psychotherapeutic practice in Austria.

The main argument is that the limitation of freedom of assembly provided the state-owned broadcaster with a new means of delegitimizing the current enemies. The dominant strategy, outcasting, assumed the categorizing of political opponents as madmen and criminals. By showing the protesters as notorious and multiple offenders, the state television diminished their credibility and deprived them of legitimacy in their political roles in order to stabilize antidemocratic tendencies and reduce the threat of political system breakdown that came from ordinary Poles whose non-compliance took the form of protests and oppositional actors responsible for organizing resistance. The media also addressed the risk stemming from intra-elite splits. The opposition to the democratic backsliding, erosion of the rule of law, and political rights violations, which deviated from the ruling partys course, was on a par with a revolt over the government.

OHS may have had to change their pattern of operation, operating times, services offered, etc. to cope with the pandemic. Data about business model modifications, services offered by the OHS businesses during the pandemic could help in better utilization of OHS resources in the future. AIMS: To understand the behaviour of OHS in different parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to both accredited and unaccredited UK Occupational Health Physicians (OHPs). RESULTS: Sixty-two OHPs responded to the survey. In the current pandemic, 51% of the OHS (95% CI 0.38C0.62) offered weekend or out-of-hours (OOH) services, 21% had to employ extra staff (95% CI 0.13C0.33) and 54% had to change their working hours (95% CI 0.41C0.65). Ninety per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.78C0.94) continued to offer routine services; however, there was a decline in offering vaccination services.

It is frequently reported to have been triggered by an infection, but there are no clear differences in exposure to, or seroprevalence of, any particular viruses between people with ME/CFS and healthy individuals. However, herpes viruses have been repeatedly hypothesized to underlie the chronic relapsing/remitting form of MS/CFS due to their persistence in a latent form with periodic reactivation. It is possible that ME/CFS is associated with herpes virus reactivation, which has not been detectable previously due to insufficiently sensitive testing methods. Saliva samples were collected from 30 people living with ME/CFS at monthly intervals for 6 months and at times when they experienced symptom exacerbation, as well as from 14 healthy control individuals. The viral DNA load of the nine humanherpes viruses was determined by digital droplet PCR. Symptoms were assessed by questionnaire at each time point. Human herpesvirus (HHV) 6B, HHV-7, herpes simplex virus 1 and Epstein-Barr virus were detectable within the saliva samples, with higher HHV-6B and HHV-7 viral loads detected in people with ME/CFS than in healthy controls. Participants with ME/CFS could be broadly separated into two groups: one group displayed fluctuating patterns of herpesviruses detectable across the 6 months while the second group displayed more stable viral presentation. In the first group, there was positive correlation between HHV-6B and HHV-7 viral load and severity of symptom scores, including pain, neurocognition, and autonomic dysfunction. The results indicate that fluctuating viral DNA load correlates with ME/CFS symptoms: this is in accordance with the hypothesis that pathogenesis is related to herpesvirus reactivation state, and this should be formally tested. Herpesvirus reactivation might be a cause or consequence of dysregulated immune function seen in ME/CFS.

A bolus of cold saline injected in a central vein travels through the heart and lung, but also the aorta until detection in a femoral artery. While it is well accepted that injection in the inferior vena cava results in higher values, the impact of the aortic volume on GEDV is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a larger aortic volume directly translates to a numerically higher GEDV measurement. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 88 critically ill patients with thermodilution monitoring and who did require a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan. Aortic volumes derived from imaging were compared with GEDV measurements in temporal proximity. RESULTS: Median aortic volume was 194 ml (interquartile range 147 to 249 ml). Per milliliter increase of the aortic volume, we found a GEDV increase by 3.0 ml (95% CI 2.0 to 4.1 ml, p < 0.001). In case a femoral central venous line was used for saline bolus injection, GEDV raised additionally by 2.1 ml (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7 ml, p = 0.01) per ml volume of the vena cava inferior. Aortic volume explained 59.3% of the variance of thermodilution-derived GEDV. When aortic volume was included in multivariate regression, GEDV variance was unaffected by sex, age, body height, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aortic volume is a substantial confounding variable for GEDV measurements performed with transpulmonary thermodilution. As the aorta is anatomically located after the heart, GEDV should not be considered to reflect cardiac preload.

Data of HRQoL from a 2019 pre-pandemic online survey of 1106 persons with lymphoma was a control. Results: 33% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 30, 36%) of lymphoma patients and 31% (28, 34%) of caregivers but only 21% (17, 24%) of normal individuals had any level of anxiety (both pair-wise P < 0.001). Amongst lymphoma respondents physical exercise and better caregiver support were associated with less anxiety whereas female sex, receiving therapy and reduced therapy intensity were associated with more anxiety. Paradoxically, lymphoma respondents during the pandemic had better HRQoL than pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy intensity was associated with worse HRQoL whereas respondents who scored caregiver support and the online patient education programme high had better HRQoL. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lymphoma patients and their caregivers had significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared with normals. Lymphoma respondents reported better HRQoL compared with pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy-intensity in patients with cancer may have unanticipated adverse effects on anxiety and HRQoL. Regular and intense support by caregivers and online education programmes alleviate anxiety and improve HRQoL.","output":"Impact of stopping therapy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in persons with lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a situation of general distress. Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women's mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (p < 0.001; OR = 19.34 [8.71-43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world.

Materials and Methods Since 08/2019, 29 (of 65) patients (9 female, 20 male) with motor deficits due to MSCC and a favorable survival prognosis according to a validated score have been included in a phase II trial (RAMSES-01). Median age is 68 (48-90) years, and most common tumor types are prostate cancer (n=10), breast cancer (n=7) and myeloma (n=6). RT regimens include 18x2.333 Gy (EQD2=43.2 Gy, n=10), 15x2.633 Gy (41.6 Gy, n=17;fewer fractions due to Covid-19 pandemic) and 12x2.663 Gy + 3x2.333 Gy (40.5 Gy, n=2;due to concurrent immunotherapy). Primary endpoint is local progression-free survival (LPFS=no progression of motor deficits during RT and no in-field recurrence following RT). Secondary goals include effect on motor function [improvement, overall response (OR) = at least no further progression] and sensory deficits, pain relief, overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Follow-up (FU) is performed until death or for 12 months. Results Three patients are currenty under treatment, one patient died after 14 Gy. Thus, 25 patients are evaluable for LPFS and response. LPFS is 100% at the end of RT (currently n=25), and at 1 month (n=21), 3 months (n=16), 6 months (n=9), 9 months (n=5) and 12 months (n=3) following RT. Considering best response during FU, OR and improvement rates are 100% and 60%, respectively. Sensory function normalized in 5 of the 9 patients (55.6%) with pre-RT sensory dysfunction. Of 21 patients with pain (median score 8, range 4-10), 18 (86%) achieved pain relief [complete in 7 patients (33%)]. OS-rates at 6 and 12 months are 71% and 71%, respectively. Six patients died (3 sepsis, 2 pneumonia, 1 tumor progression);death was not related to RT. RT-related grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2/25 (8%) patients (1 esophagitis, 1 diarrhea). Conclusion First results of high-precision RT with increased doses for MSCC in patients with favorable survival prognoses appear very promising with high response and LPFS rates and very few grade 3 toxicities.

However, its curative effect and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effect of CP for COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious diseases treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Related studies were obtained from databases and screened based on the inclusion criteria. The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis. Results We included 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases We found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, show the decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.52, P < 0.001, I2 = 54%) than in the control groups. Studies were mostly of low or very low quality with a moderate or high risk of bias. The sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. The exclusion of heterogeneity indicated that the results were stable. Conclusions CP therapy has some curative effect and is well tolerated to treat infectious diseases.

We studied whether post-vaccination immune response is equally potent in individuals infected over six months prior to vaccination. METHODS: We tested serum IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralising capacity in 110 healthcare workers, before and after both BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccinations. We compared outcomes between participants with more recent infection (n = 18, median two months, IQR 2-3), with infection-vaccination interval over six months (n = 19, median nine months, IQR 9-10), and to those not previously infected (n = 73). FINDINGS: Both recently and earlier infected participants showed comparable humoral immune responses after a single mRNA vaccination, while exceeding those of previously uninfected persons after two vaccinations with 2.5 fold (p = 0.003) and 3.4 fold (p < 0.001) for binding antibody levels, and 6.4 and 7.2 fold for neutralisation titres, respectively (both p < 0.001). The second vaccine dose yielded no further substantial improvement of the humoral response in the previously infected participants (0.97 fold, p = 0.92), while it was associated with a 4 fold increase in antibody binding levels and 18 fold increase in neutralisation titres in previously uninfected participants (both p < 0.001). Adjustment for potential confounding of sex and age did not affect these findings. INTERPRETATION: Delaying the second vaccination in individuals infected up to ten months prior may constitute a more efficient use of limited vaccine supplies.

This also includes infections acquired by healthcare professionals while managing infected patients. Since both healthcare professionals and patients can be a source of spreading infections across there is a need of practicing standard precautions religiously, to minimize this risk. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of healthcare professionals working at The Indus Hospital, a tertiary care hospital of Karachi, Pakistan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2017 and July 2018. 205 employees working at The Indus Hospital, Karachi were recruited in this study. A self-made questionnaire based on CDC guidelines was administered to the participants and their responses were recorded. RESULTS: Among all participants, nearly two-thirds (70%) had a very good knowledge of the use of standard precautions, 19.5% had good knowledge, and 12.2% had average/below average knowledge. Of those having very good knowledge, most of them were doctors (60%). Older age groups had more knowledge than the younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that among different healthcare workers, the nurses had less knowledge as compared to doctors. There was a significant association found between the age of the healthcare professionals and the information he/she has on the standard precautions.

However, the spillovers from EPU to the carbon market have been rarely investigated. This study aims to examine the spillover effect of EPU on the carbon futures market under different market conditions. For this purpose, the quantile Granger test method and the quantile regression method are simultaneously employed. The daily data of carbon futures price return and the EPU index covers the period of January 22, 2013 to July 2, 2021. Considering any possible structural changes caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, we further divide the entire sample period into two subperiods, period I spanning from January 22, 2013 to December 31, 2019 and period II from December 31, 2019 to July 2, 2021. In addition, based on the wavelet decomposition approach, we also examine the evolution of the spillover from EPU to carbon futures price return in different time and frequency domains. The results indicate that EPU shocks cannot predict the volatility of daily returns of carbon futures. However, in the long term, EPU has a significantly negative impact on carbon futures price return. The causality is asymmetric across the whole distribution of carbon futures price return. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic affects the spillover and connectedness between EPU and carbon futures price return by influencing their short- and medium-term performances.

The first communication laboratory interaction consisted of student pharmacists using their normal mode of communication with role-played patients who are deaf/hard of hearing to establish baseline measures; a pretest survey was administered to each participant at the conclusion of this 10-minute laboratory interaction. In the second laboratory interaction, student pharmacists used the app to assist in communicating with the simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing. Posttests were administered at the conclusion of this laboratory interaction. RESULTS Most student pharmacists and simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing reported feeling able to effectively communicate their needs to the other individual in their dyad (pharmacist or patient) during their health care interactions.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery transfers more stray energy than traditional laparoscopic surgery. There is paucity of published data concerning stray energy during single-incision robotic surgery. The purpose of this study was to quantify stray energy transfer during traditional, multiport robotic surgery (TRS) compared to single-incision robotic surgery (SIRS). METHODS: An in vivo porcine model was used to simulate a multiport or single-incision robotic cholecystectomy (DaVinci Si, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). A 5 s, open air activation of the monopolar scissors was done on 30 W and 60 W coag mode (ForceTriad, Covidien-Medtronic, Boulder, CO) and Swift Coag effect 3, max power 180 W (VIO 300D, ERBE USA, Marietta, GA). Temperature of the tissue (C) adjacent to the tip of the assistant grasper or the camera was measured with a thermal camera (E95, FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR) to quantify stray energy transfer. RESULTS: Stray energy transfer was greater in the SIRS setup compared to TRS setup at the assistant grasper (11.6  3.3 C vs. 8.4  1.6 C, p = 0.013). Reducing power from 60 to 30 W significantly reduced stray energy transfer in SIRS (15.3  3.4 C vs. 11.6  3.3 C, p = 0.023), but not significantly for TRS (9.4  2.5 C vs. 8.4  1.6 C, p = 0.278). The use of a constant voltage regulating generator also minimized stray energy transfer for both SIRS (0.7  0.4 C, p < 0.001) and TRS (0.7  0.4 C, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: More stray energy transfer occurs during single-incision robotic surgery than multiport robotic surgery. Utilizing a constant voltage regulating generator minimized stray energy transfer for both setups.

During the period from 30.03.2020 to 31.05.2020 (nine weeks-the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic) structural sustainability of the CPPT system in Tyumen kept a high level. By changing the parameters of the planned characteristics of the CPPT system state, an attempt to adapt the transport service supply to a sharp decrease in transport demand was made. In the period of \\"self-isolation\\", the demand for the CPPT transport service reduced more than the transport service supply. Sustainability of CPPT functioning was evaluated by calculating the elasticity of the transport supply (number of trips) in relation to the actual demand (actual volume of transportations). Calculation of the elasticity index of the CPPT system of Tyumen during nine weeks of April-May 2020 (duration of \\"self-isolation\\") is provided. A conclusion was made from the results of the research. In particular, it was found that the foreground target function of city management was the maintenance of a high level of transportation processes to the detriment of the transportations' effectiveness. Such a policy led to contradictory results-the additional financial expenses at the rate of 135-150 million rubles and quite a high level of contentment of the Tyumen population with the quality of the CPPT work (sociological research established that 80-85% of respondents were satisfied with the quality of the transport service in April-May 2020).","output":"Sustainability of transport system of large Russian city in the period of COVID-19: methods and results of assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les patients en hmodialyse reprsentent une population  haut risque pour le ?

This article proposes a smart contact tracing (SCT) system utilizing the smartphones Bluetooth low energy signals and machine learning classifiers to automatically detect those possible contacts to infectious individuals. SCTs contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the users contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communication protocol. To protect the users privacy, both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the users smartphone locally and only disseminate the stored signatures through a secure database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength each smartphone estimates its distance from other users phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. Extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods with an accuracy of about 90% when two users carry their smartphone in a similar manner. Finally, to facilitate research in this area while contributing to the timely development, the dataset of six experiments with about 123 000 data points is made publicly available.","output":"COVID-19 and Your Smartphone: BLE-Based Smart Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing demand for millions of COVID-19 screenings, Computed Tomography (CT) based test has emerged as a promising alternative to the gold standard RT-PCR test. However, it is primarily provided in hospital setting due to the need for expensive equipment and experienced radiologists.

We present COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app that can use noisy snapshots of chest X-ray (CXR) for point-of-care COVID-19 screening. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and distillation (KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP) network that extracts CXR imaging features from large scale of lung disease CXR images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network that learns the essential CXR imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or normal cases using a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical student (MS) network that performs on-device COVID-19 screening. To accommodate the need for screening using noisy snapshots of CXR images, we employ novel loss functions and training schemes for the MS network to learn the robust imaging features for accurate on-device COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate the strong potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive experiments with diverse MS network architecture, CXR imaging quality, and tuning parameter settings.

As the germ theory gained ground, it replaced the old, unproven theory that deaths from fever reflected a weak personal or even familial constitution. A new enigma emerged at the turn of the 20th century, when it became apparent that only a small proportion of infected individuals die from primary infections with almost any given microbe. Classical genetics studies gradually revealed that severe infectious diseases could be driven by human genetic predisposition. This idea gained ground with the support of molecular genetics, in three successive, overlapping steps. First, many rare inborn errors of immunity were shown, from 1985 onward, to underlie multiple, recurrent infections with Mendelian inheritance. Second, a handful of rare and familial infections also segregating as Mendelian traits but striking humans resistant to other infections were deciphered molecularly from 1996 onward. Third, a growing number of rare or common sporadic infections were shown to result from monogenic, but not Mendelian, inborn errors from 2007 onward. A synthesis of the hitherto mutually exclusive germ and genetic theories is now in view. This article has been accepted for publication on April 14, 2020.

Mutations on its gene have been linked to 5-reductase deficiency and prostate cancer. Finasteride and dutasteride as SRD52 inhibitors are widely used anti-androgen drugs for benign prostate hyperplasia, which have recently been indicated in the treatment of COVID-19. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme catalysis and inhibition remained elusive for SRD52 and other eukaryotic integral membrane steroid reductases due to a lack of structural information. Here, we report a crystal structure of human SRD52 at 2.8 ? revealing a unique 7-TM structural topology and an intermediate adduct of finasteride and NADPH as NADP-dihydrofinasteride in a largely enclosed binding cavity inside the membrane. Structural analysis together with computational and mutagenesis studies reveals molecular mechanisms for the 5-reduction of testosterone and the finasteride inhibition involving residues E57 and Y91. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate high conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region regulating the NADPH/NADP (+) exchange. Mapping disease-causing mutations of SRD52 to our structure suggests molecular mechanisms for their pathological effects.

P27-encoding CfMV sequence flanking the minimal frameshift signal caused 2-fold increase in the ?1 PRF efficiencies both in yeast and in bacteria.

We propose that the amount of premature translation termination from control mRNAs played a role in determining the calculated ?1PRF efficiency. Co-expression of CfMV P27 with the dual reporter vector containing the minimal frameshift signal reduced the production of the downstream reporter, whereas replicase co-expression had no pronounced effect.

Local governments have introduced restrictive measures because of the danger posed by this virus. One increasing negative effect of these implementations among residents living in LTCFs is their subjective feelings of loneliness. This study assumed that these measures weighed heavily particularly on residents living in LTCFs, as this group of older people could not decide for themselves whether or how they should be implemented. Thus, this study investigated the retrospectively reported subjective loneliness of residents living in LTCFs. On a large-scale Swiss survey (N = 828; mean age: 87.78, 75% female), residents of 22 LTCFs filled out a questionnaire on their subjective feelings of loneliness during the pandemic. The retrospective loneliness scores of the residents living in LTCFs were found to exceed those reported in other studies focusing on community-dwelling older people. Multivariate regression analyses showed that females, individuals with lower values of joy in life and life satisfaction, and individuals who were not satisfied with the manner in which their care home coped with the COVID-19 measures significantly felt lonelier. Therefore, the subjective feelings of loneliness of residents in LTCFs should be monitored very carefully. As the measures have still not been completely lifted, residents of LTCFs are assumed to still experience social isolation and be at high risk of encountering prolonged feelings of loneliness, which can be detrimental to their mental health and well-being.","output":"Retrospective feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic among residents of long-term care facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A pandemia da COVID-19 vem afetando o modo de vida nas cidades.

METHODS: Demographic information and co-morbidities for patients screened for COVID-19 across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) up to June 10th, 2020 were included. Descriptive analyses and ensemble feature selection were performed to describe the relationships between these predictors and the outcomes of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, COVID-19 related hospitalization, intubation and death. RESULTS: Out of 47,379 tested individuals, 1,094 had a history of GU cancer diagnosis, of these 192 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Ensemble feature selection identified social determinants including zipcode, race/ethnicity, age, smoking status and English as preferred first language - as being the majority of significant predictors for each of this study's four COVID-19 related outcomes: a positive test, hospitalization, intubation and death. CONCLUSIONS: Patient and neighborhood level SDOH including zip code/NYC borough, age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and English as preferred language are amongst the most significant predictors of these clinically relevant outcomes for COVID-19 patients with a GU cancer.

Results: The mean age of presentation was 7 years. 76.6%(n=23) were male and 23.3%(n=7) were female. 90%(n=27) children had concomitant or isolated gastrointestinal complaints. 44.4% presented with abdominal pain (n=12), 33.3%(n=9) had loose stools, 18.5%(n=5) had vomiting. Only 1 child presented with blood in stool. All patients had positive COVID-19 IgG antibodies (mean titre- 40.1AU/ml). Mean C-reactive protein was 94.7mmHr. 50%(n=15) had deranged liver function tests. Both hyperbilirubinemia with raised liver enzymes were noted in 3(20%), both aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in 8 (53.3%), isolated AST elevation in 4 (26.6%). International normalised ratio (INR) was normal in all. Abdominal imaging (n=8) was normal in 2(25%), two showed distal ileal diffuse mural thickening, two had cholecystitis and one had pancreatitis. 1 expired (3.3%) and 29(96.6%) were discharged successfully. Conclusion: GI manifestations are common and so is the hepatobiliary involvement. Hepatocellular injury leading to hepatitis pattern is common, but involvement of pancreatico-biliary system should also be ruled out. Prognosis is excellent without any residual damage to the liver clinically, biochemically, and radiologically.","output":"Hepato-biliary Manifestations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: Single Centre Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives We sought to evaluate the success of telemedicine during New York City's COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home period, and understand the distribution of sleep complaints seen.

Additionally, crowded human clusters facilitated the transmission of the virus, which brings up the need for new systems for monitoring such situations. To address such issues, this research proposes an object recognition visual system based on deep learning to monitor the mask-wearing in a certain space and the control of the number of people indoors as an important tool during an epidemic. This research mainly investigates two types of identification. The first is to monitor whether people entering the site wear a mask at the entrance and exit of the field, and the second is to count the number of people entering a specific area. Experimental results show that by utilising the visual sensor, it is possible to detect and identify the people who frequently enter and exit in real-time. An advanced transfer learning approach has been employed to achieve the best discrimination performance. The actual training results prove that the migration learning Mask R-CNN algorithm produced by this method and the original Mask R-CNN algorithm have increased the mAP by 3 %, reaching a mAP of 96 %. In addition, the accuracy of the random sampling and identification in actual scenes has reached 92.1 %.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related movement restrictions on the incidence of hip fractures in different age groups. METHODS: This single center retrospective observational study included all patients over 60 years old admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of hip fracture during March and April 2020. Exclusion criteria were periprosthetic or pathologic fractures and multitrauma. We collected the same data on all patients with hip fractures admitted during March and April of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Mean patient age increased from 81.7 to 85.0 years. Only two of 49 patients tested positive for COVID-19. The data show a decrease of 38% in fracture load, but a striking decrease of 85% and 59% among sexagenarians and septuagenarian, respectively. There was no decrease among nonagenarians. Early mortality, both at 30 days and 90 days, was twice as common during the pandemic. However, stratification by age group demonstrated that the risks of early mortality were the same as previous years. Mean waiting time for surgery decreased from 27.5 to 18.9 hours. Patient discharge to home over a rehabilitation facility increased from 9% to 17. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the epidemiology of hip fractures in the elderly.

The deregulation and dysfunction of miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis have been reported previously. AIMS: To identify miRNA(s) playing a role in HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We analyzed online microarray expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for differentially expressed miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis-related disease liver tissues, examined the specific effects of the candidate miRNA on TGF-?-induced HSC activation, and screened for the targets of the candidate miRNA in the TGF-?/SMAD signaling. Then, the predicted miRNA-mRNA binding, the specific effects of the target mRNA, and the dynamic effects of miRNA and mRNA on TGF-?-induced HSC activation were investigated. RESULTS: The miR-503 expression was upregulated in TGF-?-activated HSCs. miR-503 overexpression enhanced, while miR-503 inhibition attenuated TGF-?-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. miR-503 targeted SMAD7 to inhibit SMAD7 expression. SMAD7 knockdown also aggravated TGF-?-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on TGF-?-induced HSC activation were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. In CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model in rats, miR-503 overexpression aggravated, whereas SMAD7 overexpression improved CCl4-induced fibrotic changes in rats' liver tissues. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on CCl4-induced fibrotic changes were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. CONCLUSION: miR-503 acts on HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis through SMAD7.

The purpose of this study was to explore microstate (MS) and scale-free dynamics of microstate sequence (SFML) in NSZ patients, DE patients and healthy controls (HC). METHODS The subjects included 30 NSZ patients, 32 DE patients and 34 age-matched healthy controls. A resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) was recorded under two conditions: (1) resting state with eyes opened (EO) and (2) resting state with eyes closed (EC). First, rsEEG signals were filtered into 1-45 Hz. Then, MS analysis was performed using the Microstate EEGLAB toolbox. Finally, the SFML feature of the sequence, which was transformed from the MS label sequence, was extracted by the Hurst exponent (HE). RESULTS The rsEEG data of all subjects were clustered into six topographies. We could conclude that DE and NSZ patients show similar abnormalities in EO state. However, in the EC state, MS A, and B values were unique to NSZ patients, while DE patients had different values for MS C D and F. We also found a large correlation between these features and clinical information. In SFML, the Hurst exponent of the EO state might be more useful in assessing the characteristics of NSZ, while that of EC state can be used to understand these disorders with different random walk classifications. SIGNIFICANCE The methods are associated with the ability to dynamically change of brain and information processing system. The MS and SFML of the EO state can be used to reflect the similar abnormalities of NSZ and DE patients. We recommend the EC state as the appropriate state to study the difference between the disorders. By combing the two states and these method, we can learn and study more similarities and differences between NSZ and DE.","output":"Scale-free dynamics of microstate sequence in negative schizophrenia and depressive disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mouth-nose masks have been requested to prevent the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This approach enabled the understanding of the appropriate bed compressibility and the determination of the minimum column diameter that can predict bed integrity during commercial manufacturing scale operation. Studies suggested that scale-dependent wall effects become negligible for column diameters exceeding 20 cm. Pressure-flow modeling produced a minimum compression recommendation of 0.206 for the MEP HyperCel resin. Columns with diameters up to 80 cm packed with this bed compression yielded incompressible beds with pressure-flow curves consistent with model predictions. Model parameter (particle diameter, viscosity, porosity) values were then varied to demonstrate how changing operating conditions influence model predictions. This analysis supported the successful troubleshooting of unexpected high pressures at the commercial manufacturing scale using MEP HyperCel resin, further supporting the applicability of this approach.","output":"Pressure-Flow experiments, packing, and modeling for scale-up of a mixed mode chromatography column for biopharmaceutical manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune neurogenic dysphagia refers to manifestation of dysphagia due to autoimmune diseases affecting muscle, neuromuscular junction, nerves, roots, brainstem, or cortex.

This opinion article reviews the autoimmune neurological causes of dysphagia, highlights clinical clues and laboratory testing that facilitate early diagnosis, especially when dysphagia is the presenting symptom, and outlines the most effective immunotherapeutic approaches. Dysphagia is common in inflammatory myopathies, most prominently in inclusion body myositis, and is frequent in myasthenia gravis, occurring early in bulbar-onset disease or during the course of progressive, generalized disease. Acute-onset dysphagia is often seen in GuillainCBarre syndrome variants and slowly progressive dysphagia in paraneoplastic neuropathies highlighted by the presence of specific autoantibodies. The most common causes of CNS autoimmune dysphagia are demyelinating and inflammatory lesions in the brainstem, occurring in patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Less common, but often overlooked, is dysphagia in stiff-person syndrome especially in conjunction with cerebellar ataxia and high anti-GAD autoantibodies, and in gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes associated with autoantibodies against the ganglionic acetyl-choline receptor.

OBJECTIVE: This paper develops a model that compares the years of life lost (YLL) due to COVID-19 and the potential YLL due to the socioeconomic consequences of its containment. METHODS: It improves on existing estimates by conceptually disentangling YLL due to COVID-19 and socioeconomic status. By reconciling the normative life table approach with socioeconomic differences in life expectancy, it accounts for the fact that people with low socioeconomic status are hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The model also draws on estimates of socioeconomic differences in life expectancy to ascertain potential YLL due to income loss, school closures, and extreme poverty. RESULTS: Tentative results suggest that if only one-tenth of the current socioeconomic damage becomes permanent in the future, it may carry a higher YLL burden than COVID-19 in the more likely pandemic scenarios. The model further suggests that the socioeconomic harm outweighs the disease burden due to COVID-19 more quickly in poorer and more unequal societies. Most urgently, the substantial increase in extreme poverty needs immediate attention. Avoiding a relatively minor number of 4 million unemployed, 1 million extremely poor, and 2 million students with a higher learning loss may save a similar amount of life years as saving 1 million people from dying from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Primarily, the results illustrate the urgent need for redistributive policy interventions and global solidarity. In addition, the potentially high YLL burden from income and learning losses raises the burden of proof for the efficacy and necessity of school and business closures in the containment of the pandemic, especially where social safety nets are underdeveloped.","output":"Modeling Years of Life Lost Due to COVID-19, Socioeconomic Status, and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions: Development of a Prediction Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a great challenge in clinical treatment due to a shortage of effective therapeutic targets and acquired chemoresistance. Here, we identified the role of an RNA-binding protein, CUG-BP Elav-like family member 6 (CELF6), in the TNBC development and paclitaxel (PTX) chemoresistance. METHODS: Stable CELF6-overexpressing cell lines were established in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell proliferation was determined using cell counting, two-dimensional colony formation, and MTT assay. Meanwhile, cell migration and cell invasion were detected by Transwell assay. Furthermore, the downstream target gene of CELF6 was identified and the direct interaction was further determined by luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down. Additionally, the PTX resistant cell line was established to determine the role of CELF6 in PTX resistance. RESULTS: CELF6 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell invasion. Mechanistically, Fructose-Bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) was identified as the target gene of CELF6 and stabilized by CELF6 via binding 3'UTR. CELF6 overexpression mediated inhibition in TNBC development was dependent on FBP1. Moreover, CELF6 overexpression increased the sensitivity to PTX treatment.

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding in various biomedical features and appropriate analytical approaches for enabling the early detection and effective diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to combine low-dimensional clinical and lab testing data, as well as high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) imaging data, to accurately differentiate between healthy individuals, patients with COVID-19, and patients with non-COVID viral pneumonia, especially at the early stage of infection. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 214 patients with nonsevere COVID-19, 148 patients with severe COVID-19, 198 noninfected healthy participants, and 129 patients with non-COVID viral pneumonia. The participants clinical information (ie, 23 features), lab testing results (ie, 10 features), and CT scans upon admission were acquired and used as 3 input feature modalities. To enable the late fusion of multimodal features, we constructed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of CT scans. We then developed 3 machine learning models (ie, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine models) based on the combined 43 features from all 3 modalities to differentiate between the following 4 classes: nonsevere, severe, healthy, and viral pneumonia. RESULTS: Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from the use of any single feature modality. All 3 machine learning models had high overall prediction accuracy (95.4%-97.7%) and high class-specific prediction accuracy (90.6%-99.9%).

METHODS: Forty-five videos were included from nine retinal YouTube channels posted from 2011 to 2021. For each surgeon, 10 videos were randomized and the utility, quality, and educational content were assessed. For each video, the surgeons also assessed how the validated CEIVITS items were presented in the videos. The surgeons were divided based on years of experience: fellows (0C3 years), young surgeons (4C10 years), and senior surgeons (more than 10 years). RESULTS: The video image quality was rated as good in 63.52% of evaluations, moderate in 30.37%, and poor in 6.11%. The quality assessment of the videos among the groups did not differ. The fellows rated the use of the videos as educational tools higher (3.99) than the young (3.87) and senior surgeons (3.47) (p < 0.0002, KruskalCWallis test); 34.76% of the fellows reported learning something new from the videos compared with 19.17% of the senior surgeons (p < 0.05).

BACKGROUND: Awake bruxism - a stress behavior characterized by clenching of the teeth - is a strong contributor to chronic mTMD. GML modulates psychological stress and motor responses and could thus reduce muscle activity in chronic musculoskeletal conditions, including mTMD. METHODS: We recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activity in the right masseter of 14 women with chronic (>6 months) mTMD (median [IQR] = 39.5.3 [24.3] years) and 15 pain-free women (median [IQR] = 30.0 [3.5] years) during a GML session, including 3 music (stressful, relaxing, and participants' favorite music) and a no-music (pink noise) control blocks, each lasting 15 minutes. We measured the motor effort of the right masseter relative to the participants' maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), the muscular effort to maintain mandibular posture (EMGposture ), and to produce spontaneous awake bruxism episodes (EMGbruxism ), and the duration and frequency of spontaneous awake bruxism episodes. We tested between-group and within-group (between blocks) differences, as well as the effect of the interaction group by experimental block on these outcome measures. RESULTS: In both groups, EMGposture was significantly affected by the interaction group by experimental block (P < .001). Compared to pink noise [mean (95% CI); mTMD: 2.2 (1.6-2.8) %MVC; Controls: 1.1 (0.5-1.7) %MVC], EMGposture increased during the stressful music block [contrast estimate (95% CI); mTMD: +0.8 (0.7-0.8) %MVC; Controls: +0.3 (0.3-0.4) %MVC; both P < .001], and decreased during the relaxing [mTMD: -0.4 (-0.5 to -0.4) %MVC; Controls: -0.3 (-0.4 to -0.3) %MVC; both P < .001] and favorite [mTMD: -0.5 (-0.6 to -0.5) %MVC; Controls: -0.5 (-0.5 to -0.4) %MVC; both P < .001] music blocks. EMGposture was greater in mTMD individuals than controls during the favorite music [contrast estimate (95% CI): +1.1 (0.2-1.9) %MVC; P = .019] and the pink noise [+1.1 (0.2-2.0) %MVC; P = .014] blocks. EMGbruxism was significantly affected by the interaction group by experimental block (P < .001). In mTMD participants, compared to the pink noise block [mean (95% CI); 23.8 (16.0-31.6) %MVC], EMGbruxism increased during the stressful music block [contrast estimate (95% CI); +10.2 (8.6-11.8) %MVC], and decreased during the relaxing [-6.2 (-8.1 to -4.3) %MVC; P < .001] and favorite [-10.2 (-12.2 to -9.1) %MVC; P < .001] music blocks. These effects were not observed in the control group [mean (95% CI); pink noise: 19.3 (10.9-27.6); stressful: 21.2 (12.9-29.4) %MVC; relaxing: 21.6 (13.3-29.9) %MVC; favorite: 24.2 (15.8-32.7) %MVC; all P > .05]. EMGbruxism was significantly greater in mTMD participants than controls during the stressful music block [contrast estimate (95% CI): +12.9 (1.6-24.2) %MVC; P = .026). GML did not affect the duration or the frequency of awake bruxism in either group (median [IQR], mTMD: 23.5 [96.7] s, range 1-1300 seconds; Controls: 5.5 [22.5], range 0-246 seconds; P = .108). The frequency of awake bruxism episodes was greater in the mTMD group compared to controls only during the pink noise block (median [IQR], mTMD: 5 [15.3] episodes, range 0-62 episodes; Controls: 1 [3] episode, range 0-27 episodes; P = .046). No significant between-group differences were found in either the overall time spent engaging in awake bruxism (median [IQR], mTMD: 23.5 [96.7] s, range 1-1300 seconds; Controls: 5.5 [22.5], range 0-246 seconds; P = .108), or during each block (all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with chronic mTMD, relaxing music and the individual's favorite music decreased the muscular effort during spontaneous awake bruxism episodes by 26% and 44% (relative changes), respectively. In contrast, stressful music increases it by about 43%. Because of its positive effects on awake bruxism, GML with selected music could be a promising and non-invasive component of a multimodal approach for the management of chronic mTMD.","output":"Music Modulates Awake Bruxism in Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has increased mortality and morbidity world-wide. Oropharyngeal swabbing is a well-known and commonly used sampling technique for COVID-19 diagnose around the world.

The robot integrates a UR5 manipulator, rigidCflexible coupling (RFC) manipulator, force-sensing and control subsystem, visual subsystem and haptic device. The robot has strength in intrinsically safe and high repeat positioning accuracy. In addition, we also achieve one-dimensional constant force control in the automatic scheme (AS). Compared with the rigid sampling robot, the developed robot can perform the oropharyngeal swabbing procedure more safely and gently, reducing risk. Alternatively, a novel robot control schemes called collaborative manipulation scheme (CMS) which combines a automatic phase and teleoperation phase is proposed. At last, comparative experiments of three schemes were conducted, including CMS, AS, and teleoperation scheme (TS). The experimental results shows that CMS obtained the highest score according to the evaluation equation. CMS has the excellent performance in quality, experience and adaption.

This study measures the impact of social distancing policies on COVID-19 transmission in US states during the early outbreak phase to assess which policies were most effective. METHODS: To measure transmissibility, we analyze the average effective reproductive number (R(t)) in each state the week following its 500th case and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases. Linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess the impact of various NPIs while controlling for population density, GDP, and certain health metrics. This analysis was repeated for deaths with doubling time to 100 deaths with several healthcare infrastructure control variables. RESULTS: States with stay-at-home orders in place at the time of their 500th case were associated with lower average R(t) the following week compared to states without them (p<0.001) and significantly less likely to have an R(t)>1 (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.37, p=0.004). These states also experienced longer doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.72, p=0.004). States in the highest quartile of average time spent at home were also slower to reach 1000 cases than those in the lowest quartile (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.53, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders had the largest effect of any policy analyzed. Multivariate analyses with cellphone tracking data suggest social distancing adherence drives these effects.

Although patients totally recover from COVID-19 pneumonia, long-term effects on the brain still need to be explored. Here, two subtypes (mild type-MG and severe type-SG) with no specific neurological manifestations at the acute stage and no obvious lesions on the conventional MRI three months after discharge were recruited. Changes in gray matter morphometry, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter (WM) microstructure were investigated using MRI. The relationship between brain imaging measurements and inflammation markers were further analyzed. Compared with healthy controls, the decrease in cortical thickness/CBF, and the changes in WM microstructure were observed to be more severe in the SG than MG, especially in the frontal and limbic systems. Furthermore, changes in brain microstructure, CBF and tracts parameters were significantly correlated with inflammatory markers. The indirect injury related to inflammatory storm may damage the brain, that led to these interesting observations. There are also other likely potential causes, such as hypoxemia and dysfunction of vascular endothelium, et al.

In contrast, the positive narrative around the burdens that an existing behaviour have averted is rarely acknowledged. We aimed to estimate the prevented fraction for the population (PFP) for premature mortality averted by physical activity on a global scale. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we obtained previously published data on physical activity prevalence (2001C16) and relative risks of all-cause mortality for 168 countries. We combined the data in Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate country-specific, mean PFP values, corresponding to percentage of mortality averted, and their 95% CIs. High prevented fractions indicated an increased proportion of deaths averted due to physical activity. Using mortality data for all people in a country aged 40C74 years, we estimated the number of premature deaths averted for all adults and by gender. We present the median and range of the prevented fractions globally, by WHO region, and by World Bank income classification. FINDINGS: The global median PFP was 150% (range 66C205), conservatively equating to 39 million (95% CI 25C56) premature deaths averted annually. The African region had the highest median prevented fraction (166% [range 121C205]) and the Americas had the lowest (131% [108C166]). Low-income countries tended to have higher prevented fractions (group median 179% [123C205]) than high-income countries (141% [66C178]). Globally, the median prevented fraction was higher for men (160% [78C207] than women (141% [50C204]). INTERPRETATION: Existing physical activity prevalence has contributed to averting premature mortality across all countries. PFP has utility as an advocacy tool to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours. By making the case of what has been achieved, the prevented fraction can show the value of current investment and services, which might be conducive to political support.

Two cases are going to be models of forest communities in Pemalang, namely LMDH Rawa Sakti and KTH GGL.

The aim of this study was to characterize the passive behaviour of the abdominal wall under three configurations: intact, after creating a defect simulating an incisional hernia, and after a repair with a mesh implanted intraperitonally. For each configuration, controlled boundary conditions were applied (air pressure and then contact loading) to the abdominal wall. 3D local strain fields were determined by digital image correlation. Local strains measured on the internal and external surfaces of the intact abdominal wall showed different patterns. The air pressure and the force applied to the abdominal wall during contact loading were measured and used to determine stiffness. The presence of a defect resulted in a significant decrease of the global stiffness compared to the intact abdominal wall (about 25%). In addition, the presence of the mesh enabled to restore the stiffness to values that were not significantly different from those of the intact wall. These results suggest that intraperitoneal mesh seems to restore the global biomechanics of the abdomen.","output":"Mechanical response of animal abdominal walls in vitro: evaluation of the influence of a hernia defect and a repair with a mesh implanted intraperitoneally."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to study the emission characteristics of the products during the blending of antibiotic residues in coal-fired power plants, blending tests were performed on a 140 t/h circulating fluidized bed boiler.

Many studies have focused on the impact of epidemic-preventative social distancing on individual physical and mental health. However, in the field of social distancing for epidemic prevention, what are the changes in youth anti-epidemic action and states caused by their interpersonal resources and interactions? Responding to this question by studying the impact of the elements of social capital in youths anti-epidemic actions and anti-epidemic states could help identify an effective mechanism for balancing social distancing for effective epidemic prevention and sustainable social-participation development among youth. Bourdieus field theory holds that the elements of social capital change with a change in the field. Therefore, we introduced the specific elements of social capital as independent variables and used a multinomal logistic model to analyze and predict the levels of youth anti-epidemic action through an empirical investigation of 1043 young people in Guangdong Province, China. The results show that, first, level of social distancing for epidemic prevention shows differences by occupation status and income level and correlates with social support. Second, social support and social norms play positive roles in promoting youth participation in anti-epidemic activities when social distance is certain. Third, social capital has a significant positive effect on youth social satisfaction and core relationships; however, social trust has a significant negative effect on youth physical and mental health.

The research shows that EU countries have different levels of economic vulnerability to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The southern European countries (Spain, Croatia, Greece and Italy), where the tourism sector plays an important role in GDP composition, are the most fragile. Germany and the Scandinavian countries proved to be the least sensitive to the negative impact of the pandemic. The CEVI can be an important part of the decision support system. It enables the identification of countries that show greater vulnerability to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may help support countries that need help the most.

METHODS: This retrospective review includes 154 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed between February 11 and 20, 2020, and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between April 2011 and December 2020 from two hospitals. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. Data on location, distribution, attenuation, maximum lesion range, lobe involvement, number of lesions, air bronchogram signs, Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion were collected. Associations between imaging characteristics and COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a diffuse distribution. A maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range  5 cm, and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range  2. No pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia.

To date, no treatments for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury can be effectively administered beyond 4-6 h after the ischemic insult. Our study aimed to clarify the significance of Sirt3 during acute cerebral ischemia and explore Sirt3-targeted therapy for ischemic injuries. Upon establishing the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model, changes of Sirt3 protein levels and the effects of Sirt3 overexpression on primary hippocampal neurons were detected at indicated time points. Moreover, mitochondrial damage was observed in neurons upon OGD/R injury. The results showed that compared with the normoxia group, Sirt3 protein was significantly decreased in hippocampal neurons exposed to 1 h of OGD followed by 12 h of reperfusion. In addition, the reduction of Sirt3 protein levels contributed to OGD/R-induced neuronal injuries, a higher ratio of neuronal apoptosis, and extensive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, all neuronal injuries were partly rescued by Sirt3 overexpression induced by lentivirus transfection. Mitochondrial morphologies were significantly impaired after OGD/R, but partly salvaged by Sirt3 overexpression. We further explored whether pharmacologically activating Sirt3 is protective for neurons, and found that treatment with honokiol (a Sirt3 agonist) after OGD exposure activated Sirt3 during reperfusion and significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced neuronal injuries. Because mitochondrial functions are essential for neuronal survival, the current results indicate that Sirt3 may be an efficient target to suppress ischemic injuries via maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our current findings shed light on a novel therapeutic strategy against subacute ischemic injuries.","output":"Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reperfusion-Induced Sirt3 Reduction Facilitated Neuronal Injuries in an Apoptosis-Dependent Manner During Prolonged Reperfusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the yield of exit screening for SARS-Cov-2 performed in order for travellers to meet entry requirements to Sweden.

However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australias external environment, which has affected the countrys decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australias quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered Chinas own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australias ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australias identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australias quest for ontological security, which has changed the countrys China policy.","output":"The Struggle for Certainty: Ontological Security, the Rise of Nationalism, and Australia-China Tensions after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: There is a need to understand population race and ethnicity disparities in the context of sociodemographic risk factors in the US experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Determine the association between county-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) on county COVID-19 case and death rates and observe how this association was influenced by county sociodemographic and health care infrastructure characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an ecologic analysis of US counties as of September 20, 2020, that employed stepwise construction of linear and negative binomial regression models. The primary independent variable was the proportion of NHB population in the county. Covariates included county demographic composition, proportion uninsured, proportion living in crowded households, proportion living in poverty, population density, state testing rate, Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area status, and hospital beds per 1000 population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were exponentiated COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population. We produced county-level maps of the measures of interest. RESULTS: In total, 3044 of 3142 US counties were included. Bivariate relationships between the proportion of NHB in a county and county COVID-19 case (Exp ? = 1.026; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.024-1.028; P < .001) and death rates (rate ratio [RR] = 1.032; 95% CI, 1.029-1.035; P < .001) were not attenuated in fully adjusted models. The adjusted association between the proportion of NHB population in a county and county COVID-19 case was Exp ? = 1.025 (95% CI, 1.023-1.027; P < .001) and the association with county death rates was RR = 1.034 (95% CI, 1.031-1.038; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of NHB people in a county was positively associated with county COVID-19 case and death rates and did not change in models that accounted for other socioecologic and health care infrastructure characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority populations.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in one horseshoe-bat species.

We observed that the PgCoV RBD bound human ACE2 at least as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and that both RBDs bound pangolin ACE2 efficiently. We also observed a high level of variability in binding to closely related horseshoe-bat ACE2 orthologs consistent with the heterogeneity of their RBD-binding regions. However five consensus horseshoe-bat ACE2 residues enhanced ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by an enzymatically inactive immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (hACE2-NN-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses. An hACE2-NN-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virus more efficiently than wild-type hACE2-NN-Fc.

The aim of this study is to analyze the correlation between the Brazilian Presidents denialist rhetoric and the low adherence to social distancing measures and the subsequent increase of new coronavirus cases and deaths. Daily data on the level of contamination by COVID-19, social distancing and information from Brazilian states between the months of February and May 2020 were used.

However, paramylon may suppress the progression of CKD via the elimination of uremic toxins or modulation of gut microbiota, leading to the alleviation of inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of paramylon in CKD rat model. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats with a 5/6 nephrectomy were given either a normal diet or a diet containing 5% paramylon for 8 weeks. Proteinuria was measured intermittently. Serum and kidney tissues were harvested after sacrifice. We performed a renal molecular and histopathological investigation, serum metabolome analysis, and gut microbiome analysis. The results showed that paramylon attenuated renal function, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, and podocyte injury in the CKD rat model. Renal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression levels tended to be suppressed with paramylon treatment. Further, paramylon inhibited the accumulation of uremic toxins, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites and modulated a part of CKD-related gut microbiota in the CKD rat model.

Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function-driven and broad-spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses.

Herein, we characterize the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by routine screening (RS) in comparison with those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion or exposure history (nonroutine screening [NRS]). METHODS A multisite prospective observational study was conducted at three major and five satellite campuses of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center between March 18 and July 31, 2020. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admissions and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Five thousand four hundred fifty-two patients underwent RS in the outpatient setting only, and 44 (0.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. RS detected 19 additional patients from the scheduled inpatient admissions for surgical or interventional procedures or inpatient chemotherapy. One hundred sixty-one patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of NRS. COVID-19-related hospitalization rate (17.5% v 26.7%; P = .14), intensive care unit admission (1.6% v 5.6%; P = .19), and mortality (4.8% v 3.7%; P = .72) were not significantly different between the RS and NRS groups.

These stressors have been linked to mental health difficulties for parents and caregivers. Religion and spirituality (R/S), on the other hand, is often viewed as promotive of mental health. However, the mechanisms by which R/S might promote mental health for parents during the pandemic remain unclear. Thus, this longitudinal study explores how R/S is associated with better caregiver mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic through higher levels of positive coping skills. A sample of N = 549 caregivers (parents and other adults in childrearing roles) across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia were recruited through the Prolific(?) research panel [67.8% female; age M = 41.33 years (SD = 6.33), 72.3% White/European]. Participants were assessed on measures of psychological distress, coping, R/S, and COVID-19 disruption at three time points between May and November 2020. Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed that caregiver coping mediated the relationship between caregiver R/S and caregiver mental health.

This report describes the characteristics and clinical outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 treated at BMC during March 1-May 18, 2020. During this time, 2,729 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated at BMC and categorized into one of the following mutually exclusive clinical severity designations: exclusive outpatient management (1,543; 56.5%), non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (900; 33.0%), ICU hospitalization without invasive mechanical ventilation (69; 2.5%), ICU hospitalization with mechanical ventilation (119; 4.4%), and death (98; 3.6%). The cohort comprised 44.6% non-Hispanic black (black) patients and 30.1% Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) patients. Persons experiencing homelessness accounted for 16.4% of patients. Most patients who died were aged &#8805;60 years (81.6%). Clinical severity differed by age, race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, and homelessness.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of PDM patients. Includes patients fulfilling the strict histologic criteria for PDM (N = 9) and patients who did not, but clinically, unequivocally had an intradermal melanoma-clinical PDM (cPDM; N = 17).Histopathology slides were re-examined. Prognosticators and outcome measures were compared between groups. Sentinel nodes' retrieval and wide local excision (WLE) were offered to all patients as primary treatment. RESULTS: 26 patients identified, 15 females with a median age of 69 years (range 3.5-85). Mean Breslow was 7.9  5.7 mm (median 5.8, range 1.8-25.0), and the mean mitotic rate was 4.9  3.8/mm2 (median 4.0, range 0-17). Initial treatment and follow-up were as for cutaneous melanoma. One patient in each group with a palpable stage III underwent primary radical dissection. Sentinel nodes were retrieved in all 20 lymphatic mappings performed and found to be metastatic in 5 (25%) patients. Treatment consisted of completion lymph-node dissection. At a median postoperative follow-up of 62 months (range 8-132), 20 patients were disease-free, including 6 of 7 patients with stage III disease at presentation. Six patients died all of cPDM; 5 of 6 patients had primary ulcerated or epidermal-abutting melanomas. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to highlight cPDM. Diagnosis requires expert pathology review and a tight correlation to the clinical parameters. Patients seem to benefit from WLE with sentinel node retrieval and complete dissection when appropriate.

Four studies reported that continuous estrogen plus progestin (CEP) users had higher MD than sequential estrogen plus progestin (SEP) and estrogen alone users. However, two studies showed that SEP users had slightly higher MD than CEP users and estrogen alone users. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence is rather consistent suggesting that there is a positive association between HRT use and MD with the highest increase in MD among current users, and CEP users.

As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers. OBJECTIVE We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians. METHODS Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65-79 years). RESULTS Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15-29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2-20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp () post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105-0.892).

GC tissues and paracancerous gastric tissues were collected from 7 patients (5 males and 2 females) during tumor radical excision surgery. These tissues were used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with RNA-seq and serial bioinformatics analyses including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA), and survival analysis. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to compare the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL2RG between GC tissues and adjacent normal gastric tissues as well as between GC cell line SGC-7901 and normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1. Results showed striking elevations of IL2RG both in the mRNA and protein levels in GC tissues and human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell line compared, respectively, with the adjacent normal gastric tissues and normal GES-1 cells, and higher IL2RG expression was associated with lower survival. Analyses on the GSE29272 and GSE15459 datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus verified that IL2RG was highly expressed in GC patients and was associated with poor overall survival. In addition, molecular docking showed that a small molecule, resatorvid (TAK 242), might be an inhibitor of IL2RG.

Furthermore, potential risk factors (gender, age, and direct contact) on the occurrence of intestinal protozoa infection among different sub-groups were evaluated. A phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis was conducted to examine the genetic structure and shared patterns of E. bieneusi and Cyclospora cayetanensis. Results: The pathogenic intestinal protozoa were detected in both human and macaque fecal samples. A total of 134 (37.2%) samples were tested positive, which included 113 (36.4%) macaques, 14 (56.0%) facility workers, and 7 (28.0%) villagers, respectively. There was no significant difference in four intestinal protozoa infections between facility workers and villagers ((2) = 2.4, P > 0.05). However, the positive rate of pathogenic intestinal protozoa in the facility workers, who had direct contact with macaques, was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09C1.00, P < 0.05).Thirty-three ITS genotypes of E. bieneusi were identified, including five known genotypes (PigEBITS7, Peru8, Henan V, D, and CM1) and six novel genotypes (MEB1C6). Seven haplotypes were identified in the network analysis from C. cayetanensis-positive samples. Meanwhile, a phylogenetic and haplotype analysis confirmed the presence of zoonotic subtypes in NHPs and humans. Conclusion: The data collected from this study confirmed a high prevalence of intestinal protozoan infection in humans and macaques. These results warrant workers of such facilities and residents to limit contact with infected animals in order to minimize related health risks. The need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic transmission, especially from a One Health perspective, is recommended.","output":"Risk Evaluation of Pathogenic Intestinal Protozoa Infection Among Laboratory Macaques, Animal Facility Workers, and Nearby Villagers From One Health Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, explicitly considering the influences of an epidemic outbreak on human travel, a time-varying human mobility pattern is introduced to model the time variation of global human travel.

The results show that the pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we also find that the pattern produces different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree [Formula: see text].

These include analyses of the most influential authors, of models and networks for bibliometric analysis, and progress towards the current research within the most critical areas. A bibliometric review analyzes data of 602 studies published (2020C2021) in the Web of Science (WoS) database to fully understand this field. The data were examined using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and KnowledgeMatrix Plus to extract networks and bibliometric indicators about keywords, authors, organizations, and countries. The study concluded with several results within higher education. Many converging words or sub-fields of e-learning in higher education included distance learning, distance learning, interactive learning, online learning, virtual learning, computer-based learning, digital learning, and blended learning (hybrid learning). This research is mainly focused on pedagogical techniques, particularly e-learning and collaborative learning, but these are not the only trends developing in this area.

More data were needed on the pathogenesis of this unusual clotting disorder. METHODS: We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)Cheparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4Cheparin immunoassay. RESULTS: Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4Cheparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptorCblocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4Cheparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Governments in the nation states are striving to obtain pandemic containment powers independent of parliamentary decisions. Sweden differs from Austria and France in that its pandemic containment strategy is based primarily on recommendations and appeals rather than directives and bans. The sequences of action during the pandemic and, apart from Sweden, the instruments used to contain the pandemic are similar. The course of the pandemic and the measures taken in Austria and France show clear parallels with those in Germany.

In this work, we aim to design a GNN which is both powerful and efficient for molecule structures. To achieve such goal, we propose a molecular mechanics-driven approach by first representing each molecule as a two-layer multiplex graph, where one layer contains only local connections that mainly capture the covalent interactions and another layer contains global connections that can simulate non-covalent interactions. Then for each layer, a corresponding message passing module is proposed to balance the trade-off of expression power and computational complexity. Based on these two modules, we build Multiplex Molecular Graph Neural Network (MXMNet). When validated by the QM9 dataset for small molecules and PDBBind dataset for large protein-ligand complexes, MXMNet achieves superior results to the existing state-of-the-art models under restricted resources.","output":"Molecular Mechanics-Driven Graph Neural Network with Multiplex Graph for Molecular Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has upended life globally and turned the spotlight on the inadequacies of political systems and their infrastructural capacities to deal with the social fallout.

We noticed a delay in nLOS detection and management in our neonatal intensive care unit. PURPOSE To develop an assessment tool to aid in the recognition and reporting of nLOS and to standardize the management process once sepsis is recognized. METHODS The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) improvement model provided the framework for interventions for our antibiotic stewardship program, including the aims of this project. A literature review was performed to evaluate tools and other literature available to guide the evaluation and management of suspected sepsis. A quality improvement project was initiated to develop tools for the detection and management of nLOS. RESULTS An nLOS assessment tool to help identify neonates at risk for nLOS and a Code Sepsis checklist to standardize the process of evaluation and management of nLOS were developed. The guiding principles of this tool development were empowerment of nurses to initiate the assessment process, clarification of team roles, and removal of barriers to appropriate antibiotic administration. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Useful and practical tools valued by nursing and the multidisciplinary team may facilitate timely identification and treatment of infants with nLOS. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Future directions include validation of the nLOS assessment tool and the Code Sepsis checklist as well as ensuring the reliability of the tool to improve detection of nLOS and to reduce time to administer antibiotics in cases of nLOS.","output":"Development of a Novel Assessment Tool and Code Sepsis Checklist for Neonatal Late-Onset Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessment of efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) following life-threatening COVID-19.

Primary outcomes were 35-day mortality and TPE safety. Secondary outcomes were association between TPE and mortality, improvement in SOFA score, change in inflammatory biomarkers, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU length of stay (LOS). Eighty-seven patients [median age 49 (IQR 34-63) years; 82.8% male] were randomised (44 standard care; 43 standard care plus TPE).

Careful planning under everyday conditions in compliance with the relevant international quality standard (Good Clinical Practice [GCP] guideline) is crucial. Specific challenges exist for RCTs conducted in delivery rooms due to various factors that cannot be planned beforehand. Few published RCTs report challenges and problems in implementing complex interventions in maternity wards. In Germany as well as in other countries, midwives and obstetricians have frequently little experience as investigators in clinical trials. METHODS: The aim is to describe the key methodological and organizational challenges in conducting a multicenter study in maternity wards and the solution strategies applied to them. In particular, project-related and process-oriented challenges for hospital staff are considered. The exemplarily presented randomized controlled trial BE-UP investigates the effectiveness of an alternative design of a birthing room on the rate of vaginal births and women-specific outcomes. RESULTS: The results are presented in five sectors: 1) Selection of and support for cooperating hospitals: they are to be selected according to predefined criteria, and strategies to offer continuous support in trial implementation must be mapped out. 2) Establishing a process of requesting informed consent: a quality-assured process to inform pregnant women early on must be feasible and effective. 3) Individual digital real-time randomization: In addition to instructing maternity teams, appropriate measures for technical failure must be provided. 4) The standardized birthing room: The complex intervention is to be implemented according to the study protocol yet adapted to the prevailing conditions in the delivery rooms. 5) GCP-compliant documentation: midwives and obstetricians will be instructed in high-quality data collection, supported by external monitoring throughout the trial. CONCLUSION: Since not all potential challenges can be anticipated in the planning of a trial, study teams need to be flexible and react promptly to any problems that threaten recruitment or the implementation of the complex intervention. Thought should be given to the perspectives of midwives and obstetricians as recruiters and how clinic-intern processes could be adapted to correspond with the trials requirements.

As a result, there was a rapid change in transplant practices and policies, with cessation of most procedures. Our goal was to understand changes to pediatric kidney transplantation (KT) at the national level during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Using SRTR data, we examined changes in pediatric waitlist registration, waitlist removal or inactivation, and deceased donor and living donor (DDKT/LDKT) events during the start of the disease transmission in the USA compared with the same time the previous year. RESULTS: We saw an initial decrease in DDKT and LDKT by 47% and 82% compared with expected events and then a continual increase, with numbers reaching expected prepandemic levels by May 2020. In the early phase of the pandemic, waitlist inactivation and removals due to death or deteriorating condition rose above expected values by 152% and 189%, respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in new waitlist additions (IRR (0.49) 0.65 (0.85)) and LDKT (IRR (0.17) 0.38 (0.84)) in states with high vs. low COVID activity.

Patients reduced the number of physical clinic visits for regular follow-up care because of the pandemic. However, in developing countries, the scattered healthcare system hindered accessibility to clinical consultation, and poorly controlled chronic diseases resulted in numerous complications. Furthermore, the longer patients suffered from the chronic disease being treated, the more physical and psychological stress they experienced. Diabetes Burnout, as an example, is a term to describe the phenomenon of psychological reluctance in long-term glycemic control. A comprehensive, patient-centered, and automatic drug administration and delivery model may reduce patient stress and increase compliance. Potential next-generation medication platforms, consisting of internal regulation and external interaction, may conduct autonomous dose adjustment and continuous selfmonitoring with the assistance of artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and wireless technologies. Internal regulation forms a closed-loop system in which drug administration is optimized in an implanted drug-releasing device according to a patient's physiopathological response.

METHODS: Patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors at a single centre from January 1, 2010 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatments and concurrent systemic adverse effects. RESULTS: Of 996 patients, 28 (2.8%) experienced an ophthalmic side effect that came to the attention of an eye care provider. Mean age at presentation of the side effect was 63 years (median 64, range 25-88). The checkpoint inhibitor most often preceding side effects was pembrolizumab in 12 (43%). The most common side effect was dry eye in 16 (57%), followed by uveitis in 4 (14%) patients, and singular cases of ptosis and binocular diplopia, among others. Ocular surface adverse effects occurred more frequently with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) targeting therapy. There were no significant differences in the frequency of orbit/ocular adnexa and uveitis or retinal side effects based on checkpoint targets. Follow-up was available in 13 (46%) patients, with mean duration of 20 months (median 16, range 2-52 months). Of these patients, the ophthalmic side effects were controlled without discontinuing therapy in 12 (92%). Checkpoint inhibitor cessation was required in one patient with panuveitis. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic immune-related adverse events are rare but could be more common than previously estimated. PD-L1-directed checkpoint inhibitors may have a slight predilection for ocular surface adverse effects.

Transcriptional orchestrators of this recovery process represent an appealing target for treatment design. We previously identified Prdm (positive regulatory domain-containing protein) 16 as an arterial-specific endothelial transcription factor but its in vivo role in arteries remains completely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To unravel the role of Prdm16 in arteries under physiological and pathological conditions, more specifically during peripheral artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Within the vasculature, Prdm16 expression was strictly confined to arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Heterozygous loss of Prdm16 caused a modest reduction of the inner arterial diameter and smooth muscle cell coating without compromising vasomotor function. Upon femoral artery ligation, Prdm16(+/?) mice featured significantly impaired flow recovery to ischemic limbs. This impairment was recapitulated in mice with a Prdm16 deletion specifically in endothelial cells (EC-Prdm16(?/?)) but not smooth muscle cells. Structural collateral remodeling was normal in both Prdm16(+/?) and EC-Prdm16(?/?) mice, but significant endothelial dysfunction postligation was present in EC-Prdm16(?/?) mice as evidenced by impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation. Upon ligation, endothelial Prdm16 deficiency altered the expression of genes encoding endothelial cell function regulators, many related to nitric oxide bioavailability and Ca(2+) homeostasis. Accordingly, Prdm16 overexpression in cultured endothelial cells affected both total cellular Ca(2+) levels and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that Prdm16 is indispensable for arterial flow recovery under pathological challenge not because it affects structural remodeling but due to its role in maintaining endothelial function. It, therefore, represents an appealing target for designing novel therapeutic strategies for no-option patients with peripheral artery disease.","output":"Prdm16 Supports Arterial Flow Recovery by Maintaining Endothelial Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Indonesia, a poster claimed to be a suggestion from the Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono X (HB X), who is also the governor of the Yogyakarta Special Area (DIY), to cook and eat sayur lodeh (soup) together to help repel the plague, was circulated through WhatsApp (WA) and Social Media The Office of Public Relations and Protocol of DIY later refuted this message This study investigated what sayur lodeh is, what messages were contained in the poster, and how the Javanese perceived these messages within the COVID-19 context This study used qualitative content analysis as the research method The researchers made inferences on the meaning inside the message from HB X using cultural perspectives The data reveals 1) Sayur lodeh is a traditional Javanese dish that includes various nutritious vegetables that are stewed in coconut milk;2) the order to cook sayur lodeh indicates the Javanese people's high trust in the Sultan in difficult times, the hopeful and constructive attitude to the adversities, the family support, and communitys unity to resolve difficulties, and God's belief in moving forward;3) the Javanese cooked sayur lodeh immediately, as most of them believe that it might help them escape misfortune;this assurance has been passed down from generation to generation This study demonstrates how culture plays an important role in cultural communities, such as the Javanese, who respect and listen to cultural leaders more than other authorities People could also obey orders against rationale or the rule of government as they have powerful cultural convictions This study encourages the participation of cultural figures in emergency or health crisis measures, and any interventions should consider the cultural context of the population ? 2021, Florida Gulf Coast University All rights reserved","output":"The sultan and the soup: A javanese cultural response to covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a potent pathogen of humans and is capable of rapid global spread. Peptide-conjugated antisense morpholino oligomers (P-PMO) were designed to bind by base pairing to specific sequences in the SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) genome. The P-PMO were tested for their capacity to inhibit production of infectious virus as well as to probe the function of conserved viral RNA motifs and secondary structures. Several virus-targeted P-PMO and a random-sequence control P-PMO showed low inhibitory activity against SARS coronavirus. Certain other virus-targeted P-PMO reduced virus-induced cytopathology and cell-to-cell spread as a consequence of decreasing viral amplification. Active P-PMO were effective when administered at any time prior to peak viral synthesis and exerted sustained antiviral effects while present in culture medium. P-PMO showed low nonspecific inhibitory activity against translation of nontargeted RNA or growth of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Two P-PMO targeting the viral transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) region in the 5' untranslated region were the most effective inhibitors tested. After several viral passages in the presence of a TRS-targeted P-PMO, partially drug-resistant SARS-CoV mutants arose which contained three contiguous base point mutations at the binding site of a TRS-targeted P-PMO. Those partially resistant viruses grew more slowly and formed smaller plaques than wild-type SARS-CoV.

Our aims were to analyze clinical and laboratory abnormalities in ICU patients with COVID-19, in order to define which predictors can distinguish between those who are at higher risk of developing fatal versus non-fatal forms of the disease. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was used; demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory parameters at ICU admission, and clinical outcomes for the adult patients admitted to ICU were collected from five hospitals in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients with COVID-19 admitted in ICU, 50 patients died, 23 recovered, and 13 were still admitted, with a mortality rate of 58.1%. Septic shock (OR (95% CI): 58.1 (5.97C7812.8), p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR (95% CI): 7.279 (1.191C65.43), p = 0.032) had a significant impact on mortality.

The study had a longitudinal design with two evaluations involving 158 people from 17 to 76 years of age who answered the questionnaires within 9 weeks. People with high confinement levels showed significant differences in positive affect, stress, and depression;people with low confinement levels and those who continued to work showed greater affection. Those who reported not having participated in pleasant activities during their confinement showed low results, and those who reported having been more worried about the economic recovery plan had a higher score in worry and a lower score in life satisfaction.

This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127a??mmHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","output":"[Treatment of a Patient with a Pronounced Cytokine Storm in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia using a Hemoadsorption in Combination with the Administration of tocilizumab]./ Die Behandlung eines Patienten mit ausgepr?gtem Zytokinsturm bei schwerer COVID-19-Pneumonie unter Einsatz von H?moadsorption in Kombination mit der Gabe von Tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infant hydrocephalus poses a severe global health burden; 80% of cases occur in the developing world where patients have limited access to neurosurgical care.

In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (n = 459, age = 42-92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.","output":"Contributions of Age-Related and Audibility-Related Deficits to Aided Consonant Identification in Presbycusis: A Causal-Inference Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last two decades have seen a marked change in the role of plasmapheresis in the intensive care unit (ICU).

AIM This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the associations of RSV- and RV-induced bronchiolitis with the development of preschool wheeze and childhood asthma. METHODS We performed a systematic search of the published literature in five databases by using a MeSH term-based algorithm. Cohort studies that enrolled infants with bronchiolitis were included. The primary outcomes were recurrent wheeze and asthma diagnosis. Wald risk ratios and odds ratios (ORs) were estimated, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Individual and summary ORs were visualized with forest plots. RESULTS There were 38 studies included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of eight studies that had data on the association between infant bronchiolitis and recurrent wheeze showed that the RV-bronchiolitis group were more likely to develop recurrent wheeze than the RSV-bronchiolitis group (OR 4.11; 95% CI 2.24-7.56). Similarly, meta-analysis of the nine studies that had data on asthma development showed that the RV-bronchiolitis group were more likely to develop asthma (OR 2.72; 95% CI 1.48-4.99).

Little is known, however, about provider practices for identifying patients who experience financial hardship and the strategies for mitigating hardship and addressing patient needs. In this editorial, we discuss a study of practices within the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. McLouth and colleagues found disparities in the use of screening and financial navigation and reliance on inadequate screening methods. To address these disparities, we emphasize the importance of comprehensive and ongoing financial hardship screening throughout the course of cancer treatment and survivorship care, as well as the necessity of accompanying counseling, navigation, and referrals. We also recommend key attributes of screening tools and a process for systematic implementation within clinical practice. With adverse health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting people who are racial or ethnic minorities, uninsured or underinsured, or living in poverty, the need to address medical financial hardship is more urgent than ever, to ensure that all people have an equal opportunity for high quality cancer treatment and survival.See related article by McLouth et al., p. 669.","output":"Improving the Process of Screening for Medical Financial Hardship in Oncology Practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Framework: Healthcare project finance (PF) involves long-term structural investments in hospitals, typically within a publicCprivate partnership (PPP).

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS. METHODS The COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms. RESULTS Fifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978). Participants with a higher pre-COVID-19 webEDSS (web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale) score (OR 1.251, 95%CI 1.060-1.478) and longer MS duration (OR 1.042, 95%CI 1.009-1.076) were more likely to experience worsening of their pre-existing MS symptoms during the infection.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) has become increasingly utilized for the diagnosis and management of both blunt and penetrating injuries. OBJECTIVE: While the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy has been established for penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma, it remains a controversial tool for other injury patterns due to the concern for complications and missed injuries. We sought to examine the role of laparoscopy for the initial management of traumatic injuries at our urban Level 1 trauma center. METHODS: All trauma patients who underwent DL for blunt or penetrating trauma between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, indications for DL, injuries identified, rate of conversion to open surgery, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the cohort. The mean age was 34.9 years old ( 13.7), mean GCS 14 ( 3), and median ISS 10 (4C18). A total of 110/316 patients (35%) sustained blunt injury and 206/316 patients (65%) sustained penetrating injury. Indications for DL included evaluation for peritoneal violation (152/316, 48%), free fluid without evidence of solid organ injury (52/316, 16%), evaluation of bowel injury (42/316, 13%), and evaluation for diaphragmatic injury (35/316, 11%). Of all DLs, 178/316 (56%) were negative for injury requiring intervention, which was 58% of blunt cases and 55% of penetrating cases. There were no missed injuries noted. Average hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for patients that underwent DL vs conversion to open exploration (2.2 days vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this single institution, retrospective study, the high volume of cases appears to show that DL is a reliable tool for detecting injury and avoiding potential negative or non-therapeutic laparotomies.

Decreases in service capacity resulted in increased health issues and risky substance use behaviors among PWUD, such as unaccompanied substance use, sharing/re-use of supplies, and overdose events. CONCLUSIONS Reductions in the accessibility of critical services PWUD rely on during COVID-19 has increased existent substance use and health issues among PWUD, while decreasing their ability to mitigate risks related to substance use. Thus, the expansion of the depth and breadth of support options is crucial. Services must remain open and flexible to the unique needs of PWUD during COVID-19, while novel and effective adaptations and interventions should remain available and accessible post-COVID-19.","output":"Identifying the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on service access for people who use drugs (PWUD): A national qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 'Columbian exchange' (Crosby) after 1492 mixed bacteria and viruses from the 'Old' and the 'New World';ever since then, epidemics have shaped the political course of events in Latin America and the Caribbean While the diseases and their victims are largely forgotten in collective memory, they also remain marginal in much of conventional scholarship, as they are not easily framed in narratives of national history or social emancipation The present contribution provides concrete examples that demonstrate the profound political impact of pandemics, but also the lack of attention they have received in standard textbooks and accounts of Latin American history The conclusions call on scholars to fully embrace the insights from environmental history and epidemiological research into their teaching and writing on the region Keywords: Public Health, epidemics, environmental history, ecology, yellow fever, covid-19, Cuba Alternate abstract:El 'intercambio colombino' (Crosby) despus de 1492 mezcl bacterias y virus del Viejo y el Nuevo Mundo Desde entonces, las epidemias han moldeado el curso poltico de los acontecimientos en Latinoamrica y el Caribe Si bien las enfermedades y sus vctimas caen en el olvido en gran medida en la memoria colectiva, tambin permanecen marginales en gran parte de la literatura acadmica convencional, ya que no se enmarcan fcilmente en narrativas de historia nacional o de emancipacin social La presente contribucin proporciona ejemplos concretos que demuestran el profundo impacto poltico de las pandemias, pero tambin la falta de atencin que han recibido en los libros de texto estndar y en los relatos dominantes de la historia de Latinoamrica Las conclusiones exigen que los acadmicos adopten plenamente las ideas de la historia ambiental y la investigacin epidemiolgica en su ense?anza y escritura sobre la regin Palabras clave: Salud pblica, epidemias, historia ambiental, ecologa, fiebre amarilla, covid-19, Cuba","output":"Repressed memory: Rethinking the impact of Latin America's forgotten pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vein-viewer is a new revolution in the health industry.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, could the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 acquired in the waiting room be greater than the risk of dying from post-vaccine anaphylaxis when leaving immediately? Methods The risks are modelled for a patient aged 70+ years attending for annual influenza vaccination in a typical Australian general practice clinic. The risk of death from anaphylaxis is estimated based on known rates of anaphylaxis shortly after influenza vaccination. The risk of acquiring COVID-19 during a 15-minute wait and then dying from that infection is estimated using the COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission Estimator and COVID-19 Risk Calculator. Results Other than at times of extremely low COVID-19 prevalence, the risk of death from anaphylaxis for a patient aged 70+ years leaving immediately after influenza vaccine is less than the risk of death from COVID-19 acquired via aerosol transmission during a 15-minute wait. The risk of death from COVID-19 is greatest for the unimmunised and when masks are not worn. Conclusions A more nuanced approach to advice post-vaccination is recommended that considers current COVID-19 prevalence and virulence, the characteristics of the waiting room, the risk of anaphylaxis, and the patients susceptibility to death from COVID-19.

Although venovenous extracorporeal lung support (VV-ECLS) has become a standard of care procedure in neonatal patients with acute pulmonary failure there are no reports regarding the use of a double-lumen cannula for extracorporeal minimal invasive lung support via the umbilical vein. METHODS A neonatal lamb model was used (n = 3). Umbilical vein was cannulated with a double-lumen catheter allowing venovenous extracorporeal gas exchange. Cannula was positioned with its tip in the right atrium. VV-ECLS was started and ventilation was stopped. Providing oxygenation and CO2 removal solely through VV-ECLS hemodynamics, blood gases were measured. RESULTS Total VV-ECLS without MV was applied to all three neonatal lambs. Time on venovenous ECLS was 60, 120 and 120 min. Initial pCO2 was 60, 56 and 65 mmHg compared to 31, 32 and 32 mmHg at the end of VV-ECLS. Initial pO2 was 30, 27 and 26 mmHg compared to 22, 19 and 23 mmHg. Initial lactate was 5, 10 and 3.7 mmol/l compared to 13.3, 12.6 and 11.3 mmol/l at the end of VV-ECLS. MAP at baseline was 51, 52 and 65 mmHg compared to 36, 38 and 41 mmHg at the end of VV-ECLS. In all three lambs inotropes were admitted to maintain MAD >35 mmHg. CONCLUSION Even without mechanical ventilation we were able to sufficiently remove pCO2 with our new minimal invasive VV-ECLS using a double-lumen catheter via the umbilical vein, supporting the idea of a lung protective strategy in neonatal acute respiratory failure. pO2 was measured 22, 19 and 23 mmHg, respectively, at the end of VV-ECLS, at least partially caused by recirculation phenomenon, which could possibly be improved by different cannula design. Inotropic support was necessary during VV-ECLS to achieve targeted MAD > 35 mmHg. While technically feasible, this new approach might allow further research in the field of extracorporeal lung support and therefore will follow the concept of a lung protective strategy in acute neonatal respiratory failure.","output":"Minimal invasive lung support via umbilical vein with a double-lumen cannula in a neonatal lamb model: a proof of principle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-COV-2 is resulting in increasing numbers of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

While there are few vaccines available now, there is the need for better treatment alternatives in line with preventive measures against COVID-19. Along with synthetic chemical compounds, phytochemicals cannot be overlooked as candidates for drugs against severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The important role of secondary metabolites or phytochemical compounds against coronaviruses has been confirmed by studies that reported the anti-coronavirus role of glycyrrhizin from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra. The study demonstrated that glycyrrhizin is a very promising phytochemical against SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in 2002C2003. Similarly, many phytochemical compounds (apigenin, betulonic acid, reserpine, emodin, etc.) were isolated from different plants such as Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate, and Artemisia annua and were employed against SARS-CoV. However, owing to the geographical and seasonal variation, the quality of standard medicinal compounds isolated from plants varies. Furthermore, many of the important medicinal plants are either threatened or on the verge of endangerment because of overharvesting for medicinal purposes. Therefore, plant biotechnology provides a better alternative in the form of in vitro culture technology, including plant cell cultures, adventitious roots cultures, and organ and tissue cultures. In vitro cultures can serve as factories of secondary metabolites/phytochemicals that can be produced in bulk and of uniform quality in the fight against COVID-19, once tested. Similarly, environmental and molecular manipulation of these in vitro cultures could provide engineered drug candidates for testing against COVID-19. The in vitro culture-based phytochemicals have an additional benefit of consistency in terms of yield as well as quality. Nonetheless, as the traditional plant-based compounds might prove toxic in some cases, engineered production of promising phytochemicals can bypass this barrier.

In response to COVID-19 travel and social distancing restrictions imposed in 2020, QBPTN successfully adopted a Virtual Multiple Mini Interviews (vMMIs) model for the selection of candidates for entry into paediatric training. The authors describe the planning, implementation, challenges, and evaluation of candidates' and interviewers' experiences of vMMIs, including the differences between candidates from two geographical areas. METHODS The contents of six vMMI stations were similar to face-to-face MMI. Implementation required the identification of ZOOMTM as a preferred online platform, securing venues, communication, development of contingency plans and central coordination by the network. Candidates' experiences with vMMI were explored through thematic analysis of the qualitative data from focus groups and free text responses, and descriptive analysis of SurveyMonkey? questionnaire responses. Experiences between 'metropolitan' and 'regional and interstate' candidates were compared. RESULTS 5-minute stations with 2-minute pre-reading were used. 78 candidates and 14 interviewers participated in the selection process. All candidates attended the focus group. 58.7% of candidates responded to post vMMI questionnaire. 93% of survey responders were happy to undertake vMMI in the future, with 23% feeling they would have performed better in face-to-face. Experiences between 'metropolitan' and 'other' groups were similar. Positive experiences of participants were related to the user-friendly IT platform, successful pre-interview communications, preparation, convenience, time, and cost savings. Stress related IT failures and difficulties establishing rapport with interviewers were reported as the main negative experiences. CONCLUSION 'vMMI' is a feasible and acceptable method of selection into paediatric training. vMMI has many benefits and can be implemented relatively quickly by addressing key logistical requirements.

Supplier selection, environmental effects such as social cooperation, and other SSCM programmes, can all help to achieve the triple bottom line (TBL) of economic, environmental, and social advantages. Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and firm performance are important factors in supply chain management (SCM). Organizations will traditionally consider a new framework when evaluating SSS performance to obtain all-encompassing criteria/sub-criteria of the sustainability index by encapsulating sustainability. This paper compiles 12 subcriteria for three sustainability pillars, namely economic, environmental, and social performance. Despite the fact that many articles on SSS and evaluation were published during COVID-19, there seems to be little research on sustainability issues to date. The goal of this study is to suggest a fuzzy multicriteria approach to SSCM planning. Additionally, using the TBL method, the problem of determining a current model for SSS in the supply chain was investigated. The linguistic value of the subjective preference of experts is represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to use standard weights to rank SSS for qualitative performance evaluation. COVID-19, on the other hand, has a detrimental impact on SSS and company results. The organizations performance suffers as a result of the COVID-19 shutdown.

This situation takes place in the modern world economic space, when the economies of countries as a result of the \\"coronavirus crisis\\" can demonstrate a rapid decline with further significant growth. At the same time, it is almost impossible to predict both the duration and depth of decline and growth of economies. In addition, the set of some ratios for the some economy parameters estimations is based on GDP level. Among them monetization and credit saturation of economy. However, they may not reflect the real level of fiscal potential of the country due to stock market capacity, technological progress, cryptocurrency development, shadow part of economy, social stability, environment protection and other factors. Groupes of scientists try to invent new indicators, which may correct GDP weaknesses or, at least, help to create more realistic and more comprehensive picture of a country socio-economic development.

Based on the analysis of the IMF data on 264 countries over 10 years, the lack of correlation between the level of monetization and creditization of GDP and its dynamics was reviled, although such dependence should have been direct. This gave us the opportunity to assume that the GDP indicator does not fully characterize the development and socio-economic state of the country. It contains components that have no direct connection with the development of the economy. At the same time, the modern economic development acquires qualitative features to replace the quantitative characteristics on which the GDP calculation is based.

An effective strategy to block transmission of pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza in HCWs is important. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An infection control program was implemented to survey and prevent nosocomial outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) influenza at a 2,600-bed, tertiary-care academic hospital. In total, 4,963 employees at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital recorded their temperature and received online education on control practices for influenza infections. Administration records provided vaccination records and occupational characteristics of all HCWs. Early recognition of a pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza case was followed by a semi-structured questionnaire to analyze possible routes of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact. Surveillance spanned August 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010; 51 HCWs were confirmed to have novel H1N1 (2009) influenza by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact infection was 13.7% (7/51), 13.7% (7/51), and 72.5% (37/51), respectively. The prevalence of the novel H1N1 infection was significantly lower among vaccinated HCWs than among unvaccinated HCWs (p<0.001). Higher viral loads in throat swabs were found in HCWs with patient and household contact infection than in those with unspecified contact infection (4.15 vs. 3.53 copies/mL, log(10), p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A surveillance system with daily temperature recordings and online education for HCWs is important for a low attack rate of H1N1 (2009) influenza transmission before H1N1 (2009) influenza vaccination is available, and the attack rate is further decreased after mass vaccination. Unspecified contact infection rates were significantly higher than that of patient contact and household contact infection, highlighting the need for public education of influenza transmission in addition to hospital infection control.","output":"A Surveillance System to Reduce Transmission of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza in a 2600-Bed Medical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported.

The objectives of this study were to (1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data and (2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic caseCfatality ratio (sCFR), and the infectionCfatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. METHOD AND FINDINGS: We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei Province, China, and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wrttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain, and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were as follows: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%C2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2%C4.2%), and IFR 2.9% (2.4%C3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe, estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4%C0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1%C1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among individuals 80 years or older, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI 16%C26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI 28%C40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required, and these are not available in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic: A modeling study in Hubei, China, and six regions in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With communities facing so much unrest, here are two skills you can apply to help promote healing","output":"Building Community Well-being Through Emotional Intelligence and Cognitive Reframing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astham is recognized as the most common treatable chronic disease of the lung, afflicting over 100 million people of all age groups yet, despite therapeutic advances, there has been little impact on the rising morbidity and mortality from the disease.

However, bilateral RLNP has been rarely reported in esophagectomy patients. The objective of our study is to investigate the clinical significance of patients who had bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent esophagectomy at a single center from 1994 to 2018. Among these, patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were included in this study. RESULTS A total of 3217 patients were reviewed and 400 (12.4%) patients had RLNP, including 56 patients with bilateral RLNP identified by laryngoscopic examination. During the postoperative managements, 10 of the 56 patients (17.9%) required tracheostomy. Among them, two died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the other eight patients were discharged after removing the tracheostomy tube. The median lengths of hospital and intensive care unit stay were 19.5 (range 8-157) and 2 (range 1-46) days, respectively. Forty-six patients (83.6%) were discharged with oral feeding after swallowing therapy including tongue holding maneuver and head tilt exercise. The other five patients (8.9%) were discharged with alternative enteral feeding via jejunostomy, but they were able to achieve oral diet 2-3 months after surgery. CONCLUSION Bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy was rare, but it required great attention to prevent severe respiratory complications. However, only a few patients required tracheostomy and the majority achieved oral ingestion after intensive rehabilitation.

However, there are limited performance benchmarks in IAT and there is a scarcity of information on how to structure an effective IAT protocol and its impact on time to treatment. The objective of our study was to detail a standardized IAT protocol, and to assess its influence on time to treatment in ischemic stroke. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study over 4 years at a comprehensive stroke center. A standardized IAT protocol was implemented in June 2013 that included pre-notifying the stroke team before hospital arrival, defining clinician roles, processing tasks in parallel, and standardizing IAT procedures. Three time metrics were examined and reported as median (IQR) minutes: arrival to CT imaging, CT to groin puncture, and puncture to recanalization. We compared these metrics in patients admitted before implementation (January 2012-May 2013) to patients admitted after (June 2013-December 2015) using Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS 380 patients were included. After the protocol was implemented, there were significant reductions in time from arrival to CT (17 (14-21) vs 13 (11-19) min, p<0.001), CT to puncture (46 (30-82) vs 31 (23-54) min, p<0.001), and puncture to recanalization (65 (33-90) vs 37 (22-65) min, p<0.001). 60% of time was saved during puncture to recanalization. Significant reductions in time were observed during both normal working hours and off-hours. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a standardized protocol resulted in a significant reduction in time to recanalization for patients with an ischemic stroke. A standardized IAT protocol decreases time to recanalization when team roles are clearly defined, tasks are processed in parallel, and procedures are standardized.","output":"A standardized neurointerventional thrombectomy protocol leads to faster recanalization times."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Relaxation practices might be helpful exercises for coping with anxiety and stressful sensations. They may be of particular utility when used in web-based interventions during periods of social isolation. OBJECTIVE: This randomized study aimed to test whether web-based relaxation practices like natural sounds, deep respiration, and body scans can promote relaxation and a positive emotional state, and reduce psychomotor activation and preoccupation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. Each condition was characterized by a single online session of a guided square breathing exercise, a guided body scan exercise, or natural sounds. The participants listened to one of the fully automated audio clips for 7 minutes and pre-post completed self-assessed scales on perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation, level of preoccupation associated with COVID-19, and emotional state. At the end of the session, qualitative reports on subjective experience were also collected. RESULTS: Overall, 294 participants completed 75% of the survey and 240 completed the entire survey as well as one of three randomly assigned interventions. Perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation/stress, and preoccupation related to COVID-19 showed a positive improvement after participants listened to the audio clips. The same pattern was observed for the valence and perceived dominance of the emotional state. The square breathing and body scan exercises yielded superior results compared to natural sounds in lowering perceived stress.

Herein, we describe the epidemiological characteristics of this outbreak and evaluate the implemented containment measures against this outbreak. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention provided the data on SARS-CoV-2 infections reported between 21 May and 24 June 2021. We estimated the incubation period distribution by fitting a gamma distribution to the data, while the serial interval distribution was estimated by fitting a normal distribution. The instantaneous effective reproductive number (R(t)) was estimated to reflect the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical severity was compared for cases with different vaccination statuses using an ordinal regression model after controlling for age. Of the reported local cases, 7/153 (4.6%) were asymptomatic. The median incubation period was 6.02 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.42C6.71) days and the means of serial intervals decreased from 5.19 (95% CI: 4.29C6.11) to 3.78 (95% CI: 2.74C4.81) days. The incubation period increased with age (P<0.001). A hierarchical prevention and control strategy against COVID-19 was implemented in Guangzhou, with R(t) decreasing from 6.83 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.98C10.44) for the 7-day time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter. Individuals with partial or full vaccination schedules with BBIBP-CorV or CoronaVac accounted for 15.3% of the COVID-19 cases. Clinical symptoms were milder in partially or fully vaccinated cases than in unvaccinated cases (odds ratio [OR] = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.07C0.94]). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The hierarchical prevention and control strategy against COVID-19 in Guangzhou was timely and effective.

Vaccines are often considered as a cost-effective way to prevent and control infectious diseases, and the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines have been progressing unprecedently. It is needed to understand individuals willingness to pay (WTP) among general population, which provides information about social demand, access and financing for future COVID-19 vaccination. Objective To investigate individuals WTP and financing mechanism preference for COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic period in China. Methods During March 1-18, 2020, we conducted a network stratified random sampling survey with 2058 respondents in China. The survey questionnaires included out-of-pocket WTP, financing mechanism preference as well as basic characteristics of the respondents; risk perception and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; attitude for future COVID-19 vaccination. Multivariable Tobit regression was used to determine impact factors for respondents out-of-pocket WTP. Results The individuals mean out-of-pocket WTP for full COVID-19 vaccination was CNY 254 (USD 36.8) with median of CNY 100 (USD 14.5). Most respondents believed that governments (90.9%) and health insurance (80.0%) needed to pay for some or full portions of COVID-19 vaccination, although 84.3% stated that individuals needed to pay. Annual family income, employee size in the workplace, and whether considering the COVID-19 pandemic in China in a declining trend affected respondents WTP significantly. Conclusion The findings demonstrated the individuals WTP for COVID-19 vaccination in China and their preferences for financing sources from individuals, governments and health insurance. And to suggest an effective and optimal financing strategy, the public health perspective with equal access to COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized to ensure a high vaccination rate.","output":"Willingness to Pay and Financing Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccination in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormalities in AIDS patients usually associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Zidovudine (AZT), which is one of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug families of the first line antiretroviral therapy regimen for HIV/AIDS patients, causes anemia due to early long-term of higher-dose therapy. This study was aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of anemia among AZT containing HAART experienced adult HIV/ADIS patients at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital, northwest, Ethiopia, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among a total of 320 adult AZT based HAART experienced HIV/AIDS patients from January 2016 to December 2018. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the patients' charts. All required data for this study were extracted from patients' medical charts. Data were coded, cleared and entered into Epi Info version 3.5.3, and transformed to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of anemia and P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significance. RESULTS: A total of 320 adult AZT based HAART experienced HIV/AIDS patients' charts were assessed. Of the total patients, 198 (61.9%) were females and 133 (41.6%) were within the age range of 35-45 years. More than half, 237(76.9%) of the patients were from the urban area and 186 (58.1%) were on WHO clinical stage III at the baseline. The prevalence of anemia was 50% (95% CI 44.7-55.0%), 44.1% (95% CI 38.4-50.0%), 35.6% (95% CI 30.3-40.6%), 40% (95% CI 34.4-45.6%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.0-46.3) and 39.1% (95% CI 33.4-44.1%) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months of follow-up period, respectively. The overall prevalence of anemia was 41.6%. Anemia had significant association with WHO clinical stage and base line Hgb values. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of participants were anemic in this study. WHO clinical stage and baseline Hgb value were the contributing factors for anemia among these patients. Therefore, anemia needs an immediate intervention on associated factor to improve the anemic status and living condition of HIV patient.","output":"Magnitude and associated factors of anemia among AZT based HAART experienced adult HIV patients at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest, Ethiopia, 2019: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presents a column from the presidents of the CHFA who discuss the current impacts of COVID-19 in the United States and in health care.

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far claimed more than 0.38 million lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus displays high transmission rates, the underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries, suggesting that its spread is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16 (ORF1b polyproteins) and in the S-protein within 10 viral isolates from the United States. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and binding with the human receptors, indicating that the viral variants that are circulating in the population of the United States are different from those circulating in the populations of other countries. In addition, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of a U.S. isolate (GenBank accession no. MT188341.1) leading to a shift in the amino acid frame from position 2540 onward. Through comparative structural analysis of the wild-type and mutant proteins, we showed that this addition of a phenylalanine residue renders the protein in the mutant less stable, which might affect mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase function. We further analyzed the SARS-CoV-2Chuman interactome, which revealed that the interferon signaling pathway is targeted by orf1ab during infection and that it also interacts with NF-B-repressing factor (NKRF), which is a potential regulator of interleukin-8 (IL-8). We propose that targeting this interaction may subsequently improve the health condition of COVID-19 patients. Our analysis also emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates spliceosome machinery during infection; hence, targeting splicing might affect viral replication. In conclusion, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is targeting interferon and the notch signaling pathway along with spliceosome machinery to evade host challenges. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic continues to storm the world, with over 6.5 million cases worldwide. The severity of the disease varies with the territories and is mainly influenced by population density and age factor. In this study, we analyzed the transmission pattern of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 11 different countries. Our study also revealed several nonsynonymous mutations in ORF1b and S-proteins and the impact on their structural stability. Our analysis showed the manipulation of host system by viral proteins through SARS-CoV-2Chuman protein interactome, which can be useful to understand the impact of virus on human health.","output":"Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS-CoV-2 Reveals Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, including medical education.

To understand the disparities in vaccine availability and hesitancy, adolescent-, household-, and area-level characteristics associated with patterns of vaccine coverage are described. METHODS In 2020-2021, the authors generated national estimates among 8 possible combinations of vaccine coverage and identified the associated characteristics using 2015-2017 National Immunization Survey-Teen for male and female adolescents aged 13-17 years (N=63,299) linked to area (ZIP code) characteristics. Next, the factors associated with a missed opportunity for human papillomavirus vaccine (i.e., receipt of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis and meningococcal conjugate only compared with coverage of all the 3 vaccines) were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS Most U.S. adolescents received all the 3 vaccines (42.9%) or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis and meningococcal conjugate only (32.1%); fewer received no vaccines (7.7%) or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis only (6.6%); and the remainder received some combination of 1-2 vaccines. Missed opportunities for human papillomavirus vaccination were more likely among adolescents who were male, were of White race, were uninsured, were in middle-income households, and were living in rural areas and were less likely among adolescents who were older, who were Medicaid insured, whose parents completed surveys in Spanish, who were in poverty-level households, and who were living in high-poverty areas. CONCLUSIONS A substantial number of U.S. adolescents are not fully vaccinated, and coverage varies by vaccine type, population, and place. Providers should routinely stock all the 3 vaccines and promote simultaneous, same-day vaccination to avoid missed vaccine opportunities.

It is important for pediatricians to understand the likelihood of an allergic reaction to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, including its excipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Episodes concerning for anaphylaxis were immediately reported following early administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to adults. Although allergic type symptoms were reported equally in recipients of placebos and test vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials, post-authorization prospective studies state that 0.2C2% of vaccine recipients have experienced allergic reactions. Subsequent allergy testing of affected individuals has focused largely on evaluation of allergic sensitization to a novel vaccine excipient, polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG is a polymer incorporated in numerous pharmaceutical products because of its favorable, inert properties. The results of allergy testing in adults to date indicate that IgE mediated anaphylaxis to PEG allergy is rarely identified after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine reactions. Numerous individuals with presumed anaphylaxis have tolerated a second vaccine after evaluation and testing by an allergist, suggesting either misdiagnosis or a novel immune mechanism. SUMMARY: Confirmed anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are rare, likely due to a lack of preexisting IgE against the vaccine components, including PEG.","output":"COVID-19 mRNA vaccine allergy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elucidating transcriptome in the peripheral edge of the lesional (PE) skin could provide a better understanding of the molecules or signalings that intensify inflammation in the PE skin. Full-thickness biopsies of PE skin and uninvolved (UN) skin were obtained from psoriasis patients for RNA-seq. Several potential differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PE skin compared to those in the UN skin were identified. These DEGs enhanced functions such as angiogenesis, growth of epithelial tissue, chemotaxis and homing of cells, growth of connective tissues, and degranulation of myeloid cells beneath the PE skin. Moreover, the canonical pathways of IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-22 signaling were enriched by the DEGs. Finally, we proposed that inflammation in the PE skin might be driven by the IL-36/TLR9 axis or IL-6/Th17 axis and potentiated by IL-36, IL-36, IL-17C, IL-8, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, S100A15, SERPINB4, and hBD-2. Along with IL-36, IL-17C, and IB, ROCK2 could be an equally important factor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which may involve self-sustaining circuits between innate and adaptive immune responses via regulation of IL-36 and IL-36 expression.

This studys objective was to estimate the association between 10 micrometers diameter particulate matter (PM 10 ) exposure and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia due to Covid-19 using individual-level data in Italy.METHODS: Information on Covid-19 patients was retrieved from the Italian IQVIA ? Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD), a computerized network of general practitioners (GPs) including anonymous data on patients consultations and treatments. All patients with a Covid-19 diagnosis during March 18 th , 2020 C June 30 th , 2020 were included in the study. The date of first Covid-19 registration was the starting point of the 3-month follow-up (Index Date). Patients were classified based on Covid-19-related pneumonia registrations on the Index date and/or during follow-up presence/absence. Each patient was assigned individual exposure by calculating average PM 10 during the 30-day period preceding the Index Date, and according to GPs office province. A multiple generalized linear mixed model, mixed-effects logistic regression, was used to assess the association between PM 10 exposure tertiles and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia.RESULTS: Among 6,483 Covid-19 patients included, 1,079 (16.6%) had a diagnosis of pneumonia. Pneumonia patients were older, more frequently men, more health-impaired, and had a higher individual-level exposure to PM 10 during the month preceding Covid-19 diagnosis. The mixed-effects model showed that patients whose PM 10 exposure level fell in the second tertile had a 30% higher likelihood of having pneumonia than that of first tertile patients, and the risk for those who were in the third tertile was almost doubled.CONCLUSION: The consistent findings toward a positive association between PM 10 levels and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia due to Covid-19 make the implementation of new strategies to reduce air pollution more and more urgent.","output":"An Italian individual-level data study investigating on the association between air pollution exposure and Covid-19 severity in primary-care setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a simple operational nowcasting/forecasting scheme based on a joint state/parameter estimate of the COVID-19 epidemic at national or regional scale, performed by assimilating the time series of reported daily death numbers into a simple SEIR model.

All presented with acute clinical features of malrotation (bilious vomit) without evidence of an alternate explanatory diagnosis. All underwent upper gastrointestinal contrast study, with three also undergoing abdominal ultrasound. The radiological examinations could not exclude malrotation and all proceeded to laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, the small intestine was run to exclude the presence of midgut volvulus. In six cases, normal rotation was confirmed and no abnormal pathology was found. Two proceeded to laparotomy and underwent correction of malrotation. All infants recovered without complication. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy is an excellent modality for further investigation of infants presenting acutely in whom intestinal malrotation cannot be formally excluded radiologically. The positive identification of the DJ flexure and cecum in correct anatomical sites, both fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, provides adequate reassurance of low risk of volvulus and avoids a full laparotomy.

The severity and death rate of this disease are lower in this age range. The pediatric populations who are most likely to develop severe COVID 19 are those with particularly immunosuppressive comorbidities. Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus \\"jSLE\\" which represents the prototype of autoimmune diseases, constitutes a predisposing ground for severe viral infections, related to immune dysfunction;linked on one hand to the disease, and on the other hand to the numerous immunosuppressive treatments prescribed. In this context, a great risk was incurred by patients with jSLE. The aim of this work is to assess the severity of COVID 19 infection in our patients with jSLE Methods and results Among 20 cases of jSLE hospitalized during the year 2020, we report 2 medical cases report of patients aged 9 and 8, respectively, followed-up in our tertiary care unit for jLES based on the criteria of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics \\"SLICC 2012\\" and the American College of Rheumatology \\"ACR 2019\\", and who developed a cough, progressing dyspnea and feverish.

The study of rare 'experiments of nature' in the setting of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) caused by monogenic germline variants has revealed key insights into the molecular and cellular requirements for immune-mediated protection against infectious diseases. This review will provide an overview of the discoveries obtained from investigating severe COVID-19 in patients with defined IEI or otherwise healthy individuals. RECENT FINDINGS Genetic, serological and cohort studies have provided key findings regarding host defense against SARS-CoV2 infection, and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Remarkably, the risk factors, severity of disease, and case fatality rate following SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with IEI were not too dissimilar to that observed for the general population. However, the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway - activated in innate immune cells in response to viral sensing - is critical for anti-SARS-CoV2 immunity. Indeed, genetic variants or autoAbs affecting type I IFN function account for up to 20% of all cases of life-threatening COVID-19. SUMMARY The analysis of rare cases of severe COVID-19, coupled with assessing the impact of SARS-CoV2 infection in individuals with previously diagnosed IEI, has revealed fundamental aspects of human immunology, disease pathogenesis and immunopathology in the context of exposure to and infection with a novel pathogen. These findings can be leveraged to improve therapies for treating for emerging and established infectious diseases.","output":"Mechanisms underlying host defense and disease pathology in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 infection: insights from inborn errors of immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the volume of research and discussion on the health, medical, economic, financial, political, and travel advisory aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, it is essential to enquire if an outbreak of the epidemic might have been anticipated, given the well-documented history of SARS and MERS, among other infectious diseases. If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244-0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186-0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects.

This article reports two cases of fulminant myocarditis in COVID-19 positive patients who presented to our facility with contrasting symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings. A 65-year-old patient A had a more typical presentation including respiratory distress, chest pain, ST-segment elevations on electrocardiogram (EKG), lymphopenia, elevated levels of inflammatory markers and cardiac troponin I. A 34-year-old patient B presented with shortness of breath and chest pain similar to patient A; however, she had isolated cardiac involvement with systolic dysfunction and an acute pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology. Inflammatory marker and cardiac troponin I levels for patient B were within normal range. Patient A had a rapid progression of multi-organ system failure leading to her death within 24 hours from presentation on maximal inopressor support. Patient B, however, is one of few reported cases of cardiac tamponade and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) use in COVID-19 who underwent pericardiocentesis and was additionally managed with colchicine and steroids, leading to complete recovery in systolic function within three weeks from initial presentation.

To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA.

Although these commands may be interpreted as games by participants, it is reasoned that they are situated within sociosexual discourses where sexuality is quantifiable, consent is dependent upon opting out, and sexual agency is dependent upon only one participant in a dyadic encounter activating their sexual agency over the encounter, however mutual the scenario may appear.","output":"Automating Desire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To characterize the post-marketing reporting of serotonin syndrome (SS) due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with linezolid and investigate the relationship with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of serotonergic agents. METHODS: We queried the worldwide FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to extract SS records due to DDIs where linezolid was reported as suspect. For each serotonergic agent concomitantly reported, proportion of SS reports and mean number of DDIs were calculated and three different \\"SS reporting zones\\" were created. Relevant PK (peak concentration, area under plasma concentration curve, volume of distribution (VD), and lipophilicity) and PD (values of binding affinity (Ki) and IC50 for serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A) parameters were extracted for each serotonergic agent, and relevant PK/PD indexes were calculated to assess correlation with mean number of DDIs (PV index). RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-nine reports of SS mentioning linezolid were found, being linezolid-citalopram (N = 69; 10.3%) the most frequently DDI reported. Citalopram and methadone showed respectively the highest proportion of SS reports (0.28%) and the lowest mean number of DDIs (1.41). Citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone emerged as red (i.e., alert)-zone medications: they exhibited high lipophilicity and large VD (proxies of excellent central nervous system penetration) coupled with high potency. Among PK/PD indexes, a significant correlation with PV index was found for VD/Ki SERT ratio (p = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our integrated approach suggests that linezolid is more likely to cause SS when co-administered with citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone, as inferred from their pharmacological properties. Proper management of SS should be tailored on a case-by-case basis.","output":"Serotonin syndrome by drug interactions with linezolid: clues from pharmacovigilance-pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although direct kidney infection by SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial, a study based largely on autopsies shows increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 and suggests direct kidney infection.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia is used to model the arterial hypoxemia seen in SA, and through this paradigm, the mechanisms that underlie SA-induced hypertension are becoming clear. Cyclic hypoxic exposure during sleep chronically stimulates the carotid chemoreflexes, inducing sensory long-term facilitation, and drives sympathetic outflow from the hindbrain. The elevated sympathetic tone drives hypertension and renal sympathetic activity to the kidneys resulting in increased plasma renin activity and eventually angiotensin II (Ang II) peripherally. Upon waking, when respiration is normalized, the sympathetic activity does not diminish. This is partially because of adaptations leading to overactivation of the hindbrain regions controlling sympathetic outflow such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The sustained sympathetic activity is also due to enhanced synaptic signaling from the forebrain through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). During the waking hours, when the chemoreceptors are not exposed to hypoxia, the forebrain circumventricular organs (CVOs) are stimulated by peripherally circulating Ang II from the elevated plasma renin activity. The CVOs and median preoptic nucleus chronically activate the PVN due to the Ang II signaling. All together, this leads to elevated nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a response to hypoxemia, as well as inappropriately elevated diurnal MAP in response to maladaptations.","output":"Neural Control of Blood Pressure in Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neural topic models can augment or replace bag-of-words inputs with the learned representations of deep pre-trained transformer-based word prediction models. One added benefit when using representations from multilingual models is that they facilitate zero-shot polylingual topic modeling. However, while it has been widely observed that pre-trained embeddings should be fine-tuned to a given task, it is not immediately clear what supervision should look like for an unsupervised task such as topic modeling. Thus, we propose several methods for fine-tuning encoders to improve both monolingual and zero-shot polylingual neural topic modeling. We consider fine-tuning on auxiliary tasks, constructing a new topic classification task, integrating the topic classification objective directly into topic model training, and continued pre-training. We find that fine-tuning encoder representations on topic classification and integrating the topic classification task directly into topic modeling improves topic quality, and that fine-tuning encoder representations on any task is the most important factor for facilitating cross-lingual transfer.","output":"Fine-tuning Encoders for Improved Monolingual and Zero-shot Polylingual Neural Topic Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis study aims to investigate whether the protection motivation theory (PMT) and religiosity can explain the intention of at-home worship adaptive behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Religiosity, however, has a role in evoking a coping appraisal that leads to the intention to enact the adaptive behavior. Further, this study found that intention, social influence and trust in the government predict an individuals adaptive behavior for at-home worship.Practical implicationsThis study may guide the government to create a policy that could enhance peoples adherence to adaptive behavior during the pandemic, particularly regarding their communication strategy by focusing on the cognitive and psychological aspects. In particular, framing based on this studys result may serve as an insight for better prevention of virus transmission through a focused communications strategy.Originality/valueFirst, the utilization of PMT to explain adaptive behavior in the context of at-home worship during the pandemic was extended. Second, the research of religiosity in the context of a pandemic was advanced and how it influences adaptive behavior was investigated.

Here, we report the discovery of two novel parvoviruses closely related to PARV4, porcine hokovirus (PHoV) and bovine hokovirus (BHoV), from porcine and bovine samples in Hong Kong. Their nearly full-length sequences were also analysed. PARV4-like viruses were detected by PCR among 44.4 % (148/333) of porcine samples (including lymph nodes, liver, serum, nasopharyngeal and faecal samples), 13 % (4/32) of bovine spleen samples and 2 % (7/362) of human serum samples that were sent for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus antibody tests. Three distinct parvoviruses were identified, including two novel parvoviruses, PHoV and BHoV, from porcine and bovine samples and PARV4 from humans, respectively. Analysis of genome sequences from seven PHoV strains, from three BHoV strains and from one PARV4 strain showed that the two animal parvoviruses were most similar to PARV4 with 61.5-63 % nt identities and, together with PARV4 (HHoV), formed a distinct cluster within the family Parvoviridae. The three parvoviruses also differed from other parvoviruses by their relatively large predicted VP1 protein and the presence of a small unique conserved putative protein. Based on these results, we propose a separate genus, Hokovirus, to describe these three parvoviruses. The co-detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, the agent associated with the recent 'high fever' disease outbreaks in pigs in China, from our porcine samples warrants further investigation.","output":"Identification of novel porcine and bovine parvoviruses closely related to human parvovirus 4."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shelter-in-place and other confinement strategies implemented in the current COVID-19 pandemic have created stratified patterns of contacts between people: close contacts within households and more distant contacts between the households.

These contiguous anatomical areas are unique in that 2 important human oncoviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), are causally associated with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cancers, respectively. Mortality rates have remained high over the last 4 decades, and insufficient attention paid to the unique viral and clinical oncology of the different subgroups of HNSCC. RECENT FINDINGS: We have compared and contrasted the 2 double-stranded DNA viruses and the relevant molecular oncogenesis of their respective cancers against other head and neck cancers. Tobacco and alcohol ingestion are also reviewed, as regard the genetic progression/mutation accumulation model of carcinogenesis. The importance of stringent stratification when searching for cancer mutations and biomarkers is discussed. Evidence is presented for a dysplastic/pre-invasive cancerous phase for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers, and analogous with other HPV+ cancers. This raises the possibility of strategies for cancer screening as early diagnosis will undoubtedly save lives. SUMMARY: Staging and prognostication have changed to take into account the distinct biological and prognostic pathways for viral+ and viral? cancers. Diagnosis of pre-cancers and early stage cancers will reduce mortality rates. Multi-modal treatment options for HNSCC are reviewed, especially recent developments with immunotherapies and precision medicine strategies. Knowledge integration of the viral and molecular oncogenic pathways with sound planning, hypothesis generation, and clinical trials will continue to provide therapeutic options in the future.","output":"Viral and Clinical Oncology of Head and Neck Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine involves distant exchange of medical information between health providers and patients via a telecommunication device with/without the aid of an audiovisual interactive assistance. The current COVID 19 pandemic impact on health services mandated an utmost readiness to implement telemedicine which in part is dependent on health care providers willingness to adopt such platforms. AIM: The aim of this cross sectional study was to assess knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine Egyptian dermatologists amidst the COVID 19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was designed and data were collected using structured self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS: Dermatologists had a good knowledge about telemedicine (mean 4.17  1.63; p < .05). Of those completing the questionnaire, 193 (68.9%) were familiar with the term 'telemedicine' and 164 (58.6%) were familiar with tools like teleconferencing. The majority of responding dermatologists 227 (81.1%) were confident that the COVID 19 pandemic is a good opportunity to start applying telemedicine protocols however the majority 234 (83.6%) preferred using it on trial basis at first before full implementation.

Current FDA-approved vaccine manufacturing technologies are too slow and/or expensive to quickly adapt to mid-season changes in the virus or to the emergence of pandemic strains. Therefore, cost-effective vaccine technologies that can quickly adapt to newly emerged strains are desirable. (2) The filamentous fungal host Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1 (C1, formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) offers a highly efficient and cost-effective alternative to reliably produce immunogens of vaccine quality at large scale. (3) We showed the utility of the C1 system expressing hemagglutinin (HA) and a HA fusion protein from different H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Mice vaccinated with the C1-derived HA proteins elicited anti-HA immune responses similar, or stronger than mice vaccinated with HA products derived from prototypical expression systems. A challenge study demonstrated that vaccinated mice were protected against the aggressive homologous viral challenge. (4) The C1 expression system is proposed as part of a set of protein expression systems for plug-and-play vaccine manufacturing platforms. Upon the emergence of pathogens of concern these platforms could serve as a quick solution for producing enough vaccines for immunizing the world population in a much shorter time and more affordably than is possible with current platforms.","output":"The Highly Productive Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1 Expression System as a Host for Rapid Development of Influenza Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new economic and labour challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to several changes in the psychological experience of unemployment. However, existing psychological research is not always able to grasp the complexity and heterogeneity of this phenomenon. Instead, it often returns a uniform picture of unemployment. The aim of this contribution is to suggest a new approach to research and intervention in the field of unemployment. The first part of the paper provides a partial review of the classical models and empirical findings. The second part presents a new proposal aimed to address two needs. Firstly, it aims to transcend the uniform profile of the unemployed often drawn by surveys and to grasp the multiplicity of ways of experiencing unemployment. Second, it aims to study unemployment not only as a single event, but as a complex process that affects different areas of individual and community life.

While buprenorphine can curtail harmful opioid use, co-occurring use of nonprescribed substances, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and other opioids, may negatively affect treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To characterize factors associated with urine drug positivity for nonprescribed substances among patients prescribed buprenorphine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included patients who had been prescribed buprenorphine and who provided urine specimens for urine drug testing (UDT), as ordered by clinicians in primary care or behavioral health or at substance use disorder treatment centers, from 2013 to 2019. Specimens were analyzed by liquid chromatographyCtandem mass spectrometry to assess positivity for several commonly used substances. EXPOSURES: Buprenorphine prescription. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Positivity for buprenorphine and several nonprescribed substances. Unadjusted trends in positivity for each nonprescribed substance were compared between specimens that did and did not test positive for buprenorphine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with positivity; factors included patient age, sex, setting of care, payer, collection year, and census division. RESULTS: The study included first UDT specimens from 150 000 patients, of whom 82 107 (54.74%) were men and 77 300 (51.53%) were aged 18 to 34 years. Across all specimens, 128 240 (85.49%) were positive for buprenorphine, and 71 373 (47.58%) were positive for 1 or more nonprescribed substances. From 2013 to 2019, positivity rates increased for most substances (eg, fentanyl: from 131 of 21 412 [0.61%] to 1464 of 13 597 [10.77%]). Factors associated with positivity varied widely by substance; for example, fentanyl positivity was highest for men (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.21), patients aged 18 to 24 years (OR for patients 55 years, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.54), patients living in New England (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), and patients with Medicaid (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31), whereas oxycodone positivity was greatest for women (OR for men, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89), patients older than 55 years (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22-1.64), patients living in the South Atlantic (OR, 1.45, 95% CI, 1.33-1.58), and patients with private insurance (OR for Medicaid, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84). Patients whose specimens were positive for buprenorphine were significantly less likely to be positive for other opioids (eg, fentanyl: OR for buprenorphine-negative samples, 6.71; 95% CI, 6.29-7.16; heroin: OR for buprenorphine-negative samples, 9.93; 95% CI, 9.31-10.59).
