Nurses who work with respiratory patients have been at the forefront of the pandemic response. Lessons can be learnt from these nurses' experiences in order to support these nurses during the existing pandemic and retain and mobilise this skilled workforce for future pandemics. METHODS: This study explores UK nurses' experiences of working in a respiratory environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. An e-survey was distributed via professional respiratory societies; the survey included a resilience scale, the GAD7 (anxiety) and the PHQ9 (depression) tools. Demographic data was collected on age, gender, ethnicity, nursing experience and background, clinical role in the pandemic, and home-life and work balance. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-five responses were received for the survey, predominately women (89%, 226/255), aged over 35 (79%, 202/255). Nearly 21% (40/191) experiencing moderate to severe or severe symptoms of anxiety. Similar levels are seen for depression (17.2%, 31/181). 18.9% (34/180) had a low or very low resilience score. Regression analysis showed that for both depression and anxiety variables, age and years of qualification provided the best model fit. Younger nurses with less experience have higher levels of anxiety and depression and had lower resilience. CONCLUSION: This cohort experienced significant levels of anxiety and depression, with moderate to high levels of resilience. Support mechanisms and interventions need to be put in place to support all nurses during pandemic outbreaks, particularly younger or less experienced staff.","output":"Levels of resilience, anxiety and depression in nurses working in respiratory clinical areas during the COVID pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has significantly challenged the healthcare delivery across the world.

If this checkup is the only screening opportunity, women who do not attend or whose depressive episode occurs at a different time may not be identified. We evaluated women's encounters with postpartum health care to identify screening opportunities for postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS). Materials and Methods: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data for 2012-2015 from eight jurisdictions (n = 23,990, representing 1,939,865 women) were used to calculate percentage of women reporting attendance at postpartum checkups, well-child visits, or postpartum home visitation, by presence of PDS. PDS were assessed using a modified two-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Using Modified Poisson regression, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare health services by PDS, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Almost all women with or without PDS attended a postpartum checkup (85.1% and 91.4%; aPR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) and their infants attended a well-child visit (97.3% and 98.9%; aPR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00); 13.7% and 10.9% received home visitation (aPR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02-1.35). Of women with PDS who missed their postpartum checkup, 13.5% reported infant attendance at well-child visits, and 2.0% received home visitation. Of women with PDS, 98.8%, 86.1%, and 11.2% attended 1, 2, or 3 health services. Conclusion: A large percentage of women with PDS may attend well-child visits or receive home visitation, representing opportunities for depression screening and referral for care.","output":"Postpartum Depressive Symptoms and Screening Opportunities at Health Care Encounters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pig and monkey are widely used models for exploration of human diseases and evaluation of drug efficiency and toxicity, but high cost limits their uses.

Vaccine safety issues also remain a concern in assessing the clinical risks and benefits of vaccine boosters, particularly in specific age groups or segments of the population. This study describes a vaccination exercise involving Asian military personnel, and the adverse reactions and safety events observed. METHODS: Minor adverse reactions, hospitalisations and adverse events of special interest were monitored as part of the organisation's protocol for safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccinations. All vaccine recipients were invited to complete an online adverse reaction questionnaire. Medical consults at the military's primary healthcare facilities were monitored for vaccine-related presentations. All hospitalisations involving vaccine recipients were analysed. Adverse reaction rates between doses, vaccines and age groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 127,081 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 64,661 individuals up to 24 July 2021. Common minor adverse reactions included fever/chills, body aches and injection site pain. These were more common after dose 2. Younger individuals experienced minor adverse reactions more frequently. Rare cases of anaphylaxis, Bell's palsy and myocarditis/pericarditis were observed. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Minor adverse reactions were less common than reported in other studies, and rates of anaphylaxis, Bell's palsy and myocarditis/pericarditis were comparable.

The developement of spontaneous pneumothorax is reported as a rare complication mainly in consequence to mechanic ventilation in the criticall ill. Case Report: We report on two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by a spontaneous pneumothorax and bullous lesions of the lung. Bilateral giant bullae were observed in one of the cases. This complication occurred after an initial resolvement of respiratory symptoms (day 16 and day 29 after COVID-19 treatment was started). Initially, both patients had shown a rather mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia and no mechanical ventilatory support had been necessary. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? In both cases, COVID-19 caused alveolar damage and formation of thoracic bullae with consequent spontaneous pneumothorax as a serious complication.

Clinical research responses to outbreaks generate evidence to improve outcomes and outbreak control. Experiences from previous epidemics have identified multiple challenges to undertaking timely clinical research responses. This scoping review is a systematic appraisal of political, economic, administrative, regulatory, logistical, ethical and social (PEARLES) challenges to clinical research responses to emergency epidemics and solutions identified to address these. METHODS: A scoping review. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycINFO, Scopus and Epistemonikos) for articles published from 2008 to July 2018. We included publications reporting PEARLES challenges to clinical research responses to emerging epidemics and pandemics and solutions identified to address these. Two reviewers screened articles for inclusion, extracted and analysed the data. RESULTS: Of 2678 articles screened, 76 were included. Most presented data relating to the 2014C2016 Ebola virus outbreak or the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The articles related to clinical research responses in Africa (n = 37), Europe (n = 8), North America (n = 5), Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 3) and Asia (n = 1) and/or globally (n = 22). A wide range of solutions to PEARLES challenges was presented, including a need to strengthen global collaborations and coordination at all levels and develop pre-approved protocols and equitable frameworks, protocols and standards for emergencies. Clinical trial networks and expedited funding and approvals were some solutions implemented. National ownership and community engagement from the outset were a key enabler for delivery. Despite the wide range of recommended solutions, none had been formally evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: To strengthen global preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics, identified solutions for rapid clinical research deployment, delivery, and dissemination must be implemented. Improvements are urgently needed to strengthen collaborations, funding mechanisms, global and national research capacity and capability, targeting regions vulnerable to epidemics and pandemics. Solutions need to be flexible to allow timely adaptations to context, and research led by governments of affected regions.

In this work, foam fractionation was employed to remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) from aqueous solution and dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS12) was used as the collector. Since the attachment of strain cells on the bubble surface would impede the reflux of interstitial liquid in the plateau borders (PBs), a novel strategy in strengthening foam drainage was developed through artificially inducing foam evolution. Two gas distributors with different pore diameters had been mounted at the bottom of the column for regulating the radial distribution of bubble size in the foam phase. Experimental results indicated that gas diffuse and bubble coarsening could be significantly promoted by increasing the size difference among the adjacent bubbles. Bubble coalescence contributed to broadening the width of plateau borders, thereby avoiding the borders blockage by strain cells. During bubble coalescence, surfactant molecules would be partially shifted from the surface of small bubble towards that of large bubble due to the molecule density difference. The increase in surface excess of surfactant molecules on gas-liquid interface was conducive to improving foam stability. Under the suitable conditions of air flow rates of gas distributor with 0.125 mm of pore diameter 75 mL/min and gas distributor with 0.425 mm of pore diameter 125 mL/min, BS12 concentration 0.1 g/L, and P. aeruginosa concentration 2.0  104 CFU/mL, the removal percentage and enrichment ratio of P. aeruginosa were 99.6% and 10.6, respectively.

This study examined risk perceptions and attitudinal responses to COVID-19 among the educated section of the society in Ethiopia. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted from April 22 to May 04, 2020, in Ethiopia. A questionnaire addressing the perception of health threat-combination of perceived vulnerability (PV) and perceived seriousness (PS), and perceived efficacy-combinations of perceived response efficacy (PRE), perceived self-efficacy (PSE), and perceived collective efficacy (PCE). The data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0. Descriptive statistics were computed after the standardization of the scores. The scores for overall efficacy and threat were split by median value and response classifications were generated through threat by efficacy interactions. For statistical significance, 95% CI and p-value < 0.05 were used. RESULTS: A total of 929 respondents submitted their responses. Eight hundred and twenty-eight (89.1%) of the respondents were male and 753 (81.1%) were Christian. The perceived threat to COVID-19 was generally low (median = 58.3). The median score for overall efficacy, PRE, and PSE were 79.8, 87.5, and 80.0, respectively. However, the median value (66.7) for PCE was relatively low. Perceived threat significantly varied by age, education, occupation, and place of residence (p < 0.05). Perceived efficacy significantly differed by gender, residence, and use of some sources of information (p < 0.05). In terms of response to COVID-19, 290 (31.2%), 239 (25.7%), 175 (18.8%) and 225 (24.2%) of the respondents were in the responsive, pro-active, avoidant, and indifferent attitudinal categories, respectively. The avoidant and indifferent groups constituted a fear control response (mal-adaptive motivation towards COVID-19 protective behavior) whereas responsive and pro-active categories formed a danger control response (self-protective motivation). These responses varied significantly by residence, region, religion, and sources of information (p < 0.05).

This pilot study considers the sub-population of South Africans who reside outside of the malaria area, yet have the means to travel into this high-risk region for vacation. Through the lens of the governmental ABC of malaria prevention, we explore this sub-populations awareness of the current boundaries to the malaria area, perceptions of the future boundary under climate change, and their risk-taking behaviours relating to malaria transmission. Findings reveal that although respondents self-report a high level of awareness regarding malaria, and their boundary maps reveal the broad pattern of risk distribution, their specifics on details are lacking. This includes over-estimating both the current and future boundaries, beyond the realms of climate-topographic possibility. Despite over-estimating the region of malaria risk, the respondents reveal an alarming lack of caution when travelling to malaria areas.

In decreasing order of frequency, the most common outcomes (and instruments) used were: markers of systemic inflammation (ESR/CRP), pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)), stiffness (duration in minutes) and physical function (elevation of upper limbs). Instruments selected for further evaluation were ESR, CRP, pain VAS, morning stiffness duration and Health Assessment Questionnaire. Five studies evaluated measurement properties of these instruments, but none met all of the COSMINOMERACT checklist criteria. CONCLUSION Measurement of outcomes in studies of PMR lacks consistency. The critical patient-centred domain of physical function is poorly assessed. None of the candidate instruments considered for inclusion in the core outcome set had high quality evidence, derived from populations with PMR, on their full range of measurement properties. Further studies are needed to determine whether these instruments are suitable for inclusion in a Core Outcome Measurement set for PMR.","output":"Outcomes Measured in Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Measurement Properties of Instruments Considered for the OMERACT Core Outcome Set: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global challenge.

The aim of this study was to screen for stigma and evaluate its associated factors among adults with COVID-19 living in the governorate of Sousse (Tunisia). METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among a representative sample of patients with COVID-19 between the 6th of November and the 12th of December 2020 in the governorate of Sousse. The 12-item HIV stigma scale was translated in Arabic and then adapted to the Tunisian context.Three pre-trained medical doctors administrated the pre-tested Arabic questionnaire to each participant by phone calls. Higher scores reflect a higher level of perceived Covid-19-related stigma. RESULTS: Responses of 346 participants with COVID-19 infection were obtained. The majority of participants were females (60.4%) with a median age of 40 years (interquartile range, 30 to 54.5 years). Among them, 12.7% were health professionals and 12.5% had at least secondary educational level. Because of COVID-19 illness, 17.1% reported financial deterioration. We found mean scores of 14.6 4.07, 6.82.39 and 6.21.95 for social stigma, disclosure concerns and negative self-image dimensions respectively. Social stigma score was significantly higher among adults (14.93.9 versus 13.054.4 among elderly; p = 0.01) and people with low socioeconomic level (15.84.8 versus 14.33.8; p = 0.02). Lower scores of social stigma were found among health caregivers (13.32.6 versus 14.84.2; p = 0.002). Those factors remained as predictors of social stigma after linear regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for stigma is required in order to identify the most vulnerable patients and could prevent among them social repercussions. Psychological assistance of patients with social stigma would help them to overcome this crisis.

The present study examined who engaged in preparatory purchasing of safety and health care products during the early stages of the spread of COVID-19 and what stimulated this action. Results of a cross-sectional study (N = 344) indicates that possessing, or uncertainty about possessing a COVID-19 risk factor (but not differences in age, gender, race, or income), increased purchasing of preparatory health and safety products. Also, in line with past research on risk, affect, and behavior, worry mediated this relationship. Further, gender moderated the relationship between worry and purchasing, such that worry increased product purchasing for men, who were initially low in worry, but not for women. This study lends additional support to worry as a mediator between risk and safety-related behavior and has implications for understanding factors related to preparatory purchasing of health care products during pandemics.","output":"Determinants of safety-focused product purchasing in the United States at the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobials are essential for infection management [...].","output":"Implications of Antibiotic Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Example of Associated Antimicrobial Resistance in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appropriate use of diagnostics is important as misdiagnosis may have serious consequences.

Sequence analysis of independent clones demonstrated an overall mutation frequency approaching 1.2 x 10(-3) to 6.7 x 10(-3). The rate of fixation of mutations was about 1.2 x 10(-5) to 7.6 x 10(-5) per nucleotide (nt) per day. In contrast to finding in bovine coronavirus, the MHV leader RNA sequences were extremely stable and did not evolve significantly during persistent infection. Rather, a 5' untranslated region (UTR) A-to-G mutation at nt 77 in the genomic RNA emerged by day 56 and accumulated until 50 to 80% of the genome-length molecules retained the mutation by 119 days postinfection. Although other 5'-end mutations were noted, only the nt 77 mutation was significantly associated with viral persistence in vitro. Mutations were also found in the 5' end of the p28 coding region, but no specific alterations accumulated in genome-length molecules through 119 days postinfection. The 5' UTR nt 77 mutation resulted in an 18-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) upstream of the ORF 1a AUG start site. By in vitro translation assays, the small ORF was not translated into detectable product but the mutation significantly enhanced translation of the downstream p28 ORF about 2.5-fold. Variant viruses, containing either the nt 77 A-to-G mutation (V16-ATG+) or wild-type sequences at this locus (V1-ATG-), were isolated at 119 days postinfection. The variant viruses replicated more efficiently than wild-type virus and were extremely cytolytic in DBT cells, suggesting that the A-to-G mutation did not encode a nonlytic or attenuated phenotype. Consistent with the in vitro translation results, a significant increase (approximately 3.5-fold) in p28 expression was also observed with the mutant virus (V16-ATG+) in DBT cells compared with that in wild-type controls. These data indicate that MHV persistence was significantly associated with mutation and evolution in the 5'-end UTR which enhanced the translation of the ORF 1a and potentially ORF 1b polyproteins which function in virus transcription and replication.","output":"Function of a 5'-end genomic RNA mutation that evolves during persistent mouse hepatitis virus infection in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In today's world, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most critical health problem and research is continued on studying the associated factors. But it is not clear whether endometriosis increases the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Women who referred to the gynecology clinic were evaluated and 507 women with endometriosis (case group) were compared with 520 women without endometriosis (control group). COVID-19 infection, symptoms, exposure, hospitalization, isolation, H1N1 infection and vaccination, and past medical history of the participants were recorded and compared between the groups using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21. RESULTS: Comparison between the groups represent COVID-19 infection in 3.2% of the case group and 3% of the control group (P = 0.942). The control group had a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection (95.7% vs. 94.5%; P < 0.001) and fever (1.6% vs. 0%; P = 0.004), while the frequency of rare symptoms was more common in the case group (P < 0.001).

During vaccination, the genome transition of adenovirus is influenced by the architecture and dynamics of the microtubule.

ICU nurses were tracked bedside in daily practice. Eight specific areas of interest were pre-defined (respirator, drug preparation, medication, patient data management system, patient, monitor, communication and equipment/perfusors). Main independent variable and primary outcome was dwell time, secondary outcomes were hit ratio, revisits, fixation count and average fixation time on areas of interest in a targeted tracking-time of 60 min. 28 ICU nurses were analyzed and the average tracking time was 65.5 min. Dwell time was significantly higher for the respirator (12.7% of total dwell time), patient data management system (23.7% of total dwell time) and patient (33.4% of total dwell time) compared to the other areas of interest. A similar distribution was observed for fixation count (respirator 13.3%, patient data management system 25.8% and patient 31.3%).

All patients with operative repair for IMA-related T2E entered the final analysis. Indication of their operative repair was sac enlargement (>5 mm within 6 months or >1 cm from the preoperative diameter, irrespectively of the postoperational time) and/or its persistence >12 months. RESULTS We detected 192 (21.7%) T2Es, overall. We identified 37 (4.2%) IMA-related T2Es, and treated 21 cases (VLS n = 11, TAE n = 10). Aneurysm-related mortality and major or minor morbidity was never observed. Time of intervention did not differ significantly (minutes, VLS = 97  46 vs. TAE = 95  21, P = 0.901). Hospitalization was significantly lower in the TAE group (days, 4  2 vs. 1  0.4, P < 0.001). No patient was lost at a mean follow-up of 46  32 months (range, 1-110; median, 48).

METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician on admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: two points for asymptomatic, three points for symptomatic, and five points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary end point was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary end points included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit, a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3  12.7 years) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2 and 12 (5.4  1.8) at the admission and between 2 and 15 (5.9  2.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5 to 20 (10.0  3.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the intensive care unit, 8 (4.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months.

Importantly, a cheap and orally available DGAT inhibitor, xanthohumol, was found to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and the associated pulmonary inflammation in a hamster model. Our findings not only uncovered the mechanistic role of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to exploit LDs-oriented network for heightened metabolic demand, but also the potential to target the LDs-synthetase DGAT and LDs-stabilizer ADRP for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 exploits host DGAT and ADRP for efficient replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm; 95% (95%CI: 94%,97%)) and the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech; 98% (95%CI: 86%,99%)) demonstrated protection against COVID-19 related hospitalizations from the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant.

It is crucial to develop the strategies to manage this new pandemic in order to improve their effectiveness, as opposed to the ones adopted in 2003 during the SARS pandemic. In 17 years, new digital technologies and tools have been created;therefore, we can take advantage of them in the social management of the pandemic. The aim of our paper is to evaluate how blockchain technology can be used and what advantages it brings in managing an emergency situation such as of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effects of the adoption of this technology will be assessed when applied both to the management of the information flow between health infrastructures, and to track monetary, technical, and medical supply donations to hospital structures. We therefore propose a high-level, decentralized architecture that assists in administrating large-scale information and stores the gathered data in a blockchain supervised by the authorities. The distrust suffered by institutions today, the fear experienced in the last year due to the pandemic, and the birth of a technology that allows for the creation of reliable networks, pose thoughtful challenges to be faced to recover trust and hope for the future again.","output":"Blockchain during COVID-19: The Technology to Help Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lemierre's syndrome (LS) refers to infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) developed as a complication of an oropharyngeal infection. It is a serious condition which may lead to septicemia and septic embolization. LS is most frequently caused by the anaerobic Fusobacterium necrophorum. In the current post-antibiotic era, it is rare (annual incidence of 0.8 cases/million). Many clinicians are unaware of LS, leading it to be termed \\"the forgotten disease.\\" Signs and symptoms include odynophagia, fever and easy fatigue simulating, among others, infection by COVID-19. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should be started promptly. If a deep abscess is present, drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent sepsis or embolization, surgical ligation/excision of the IJV may be considered. Currently, the most controversial role in LS management is anticoagulation. Compared with pre-antibiotic era mortality has much improved (0-18%). Since 2004 there are only four cases of LS reported in Portugal (Medline). Objectives To report a case of late diagnosis and highlight the pitfalls due to initial suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods Case report. A 37-year-old female presented to our institution with left-sided neck pain, odynophagia and fever. A diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and the patient was discharged. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal-swab-test was negative. One week later, due to persistent fever, dyspnea, thoracalgia and easy fatigue the patient returned. Blood samples showed increased white-cell-count (17.150/L) and C-reactive-protein (378 mg/L). On CT, areas of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient was transferred to COVID-19 area and started ceftriaxone, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. On day 4, considering 3 negative tests hydroxychloroquine was abandoned. Diagnosis of an atypical pneumonia was made and antibiotherapy was changed to doxycycline and ceftazidime. Due to moderate size pleural effusion a thoracentesis was performed. On day 7, as cervical pain and tumefaction were persisting, a contrast-enhanced cervical CT was ordered, showing peritonsillar thickening and thrombosis of the left IJV with emphysema (Figure 1). Antibiotherapy was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and anticoagulation was started. Results After 2 weeks, inflammatory markers were normal and a reduction in pulmonary opacities was observed. All microbiological cultures were negative. The patient completed the last 3 weeks of antibiotherapy under ambulatory hospitalization. Screening for thrombophilia was negative. Anticoagulation was kept for 3 months. Conclusions In a patient with former oropharyngeal infection presenting with pneumonia, LS should be suspected. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should include anaerobic coverage. Anticoagulation may hasten local infection control and prevent septic embolization, optimizing pneumonia resolution.","output":"Lemierre's Syndrome: Case Report Of 'The Forgotten Disease' In Current Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the prevalence of inapparent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among healthcare workers, we performed a serosurvey to test for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) among 1,147 healthcare workers in 3 hospitals that admitted SARS patients in mid-May 2003.

However, limited information is available from developing countries. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the incidence of respiratory viruses in adult patients with suspected COVID-19 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. STUDY DESIGN: We collected 198 respiratory samples from adult patients hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 in a single teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur in February-May 2020 and tested combined oro-nasopharyngeal swabs with the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex) and Allplex RV Essential (Seegene) assays. Forty-five negative samples further underwent viral metagenomics analysis. RESULTS: Of the 198 samples, 74 (37.4%) had respiratory pathogens, including 56 (28.3%) with SARS-CoV-2 and 18 (9.1%) positive for other respiratory pathogens. There were five (2.5%) SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, all with rhinovirus/enterovirus. Three samples (6.7%; 3/45) had viruses identified by metagenomics, including one case of enterovirus D68 and one of Saffold virus genotype 6 in a patient requiring ICU care. Most of the COVID-19 patients (91.1%; 51/56) had mild symptoms but 5.4% (3/56) died. CONCLUSION: During the early COVID-19 period, common respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 only accounted for 9.1% of hospitalization cases with ARI and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were rare. Continued surveillance is important to understand the impact of COVID-19 and its associated public health control measures on circulation of other respiratory viruses.

It may occur during deep anaesthesia, but also in the case of metabolic or haemodynamic brain injury. The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol-remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance. METHODS We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closed-loop BIS controller allowing automated propofol-remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (T(BIS 40-60)) was measured. Two groups of patients were defined: the SR group, including patients with at least one episode of SR value >10% lasting more than 1 min, and the control group. Factors associated with SR were analysed using a stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 1494 patients [age=57 (17) yr; T(BIS 40-60)=76 (17%)] were analysed and 131 (8.7%) patients constituted the SR group. The main independent factors associated with SR were advanced age [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=4.80 (1.85-12.43) (P=0.027), 10.59 (3.76-29.81) (P<0.0001), for categories of age 60-80 and >80 yr, respectively], history of coronary artery disease (CAD) [2.53 (1.47-4.37) (P=0.001)] and male gender [1.57 (1.03-2.40) (P=0.03)].

It is uncertain whether guidelines for BP management during and after intravenous alteplase can be extrapolated to endovascular treatment (EVT) for stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. We evaluated the associations between systolic BP (SBP) in the first 6 hours following EVT and functional outcome as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS: Patients of 8 MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry centers, with available data on SBP in the 6 hours following EVT, were analyzed. We evaluated maximum, minimum, and mean SBP. Study outcomes were functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We used multivariable ordinal and binary regression analysis to adjust for important prognostic factors and studied possible effect modification by successful reperfusion. RESULTS: Post-EVT SBP data were available for 1161/1796 patients. Higher maximum SBP (per 10 mm Hg increments) was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88C0.98]) and a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02C1.36]). The association between minimum SBP and functional outcome was nonlinear with an inflection point at 124 mm Hg. Minimum SBP lower and higher than the inflection point were associated with worse functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.85 per 10 mm Hg decrements [95% CI, 0.76C0.95] and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.81 per 10 mm Hg increments [95% CI, 0.71C0.92]). No association between mean SBP and functional outcome was observed. Successful reperfusion did not modify the relation of SBP with any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum SBP in the first 6 hours following EVT is positively associated with worse functional outcome and an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Both lower and higher minimum SBP are associated with worse outcomes. A randomized trial to evaluate whether modifying post-intervention SBP results in better outcomes after EVT for ischemic stroke seems justified.","output":"Blood Pressure in the First 6 Hours Following Endovascular Treatment for Ischemic Stroke Is Associated With Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New affordable therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 are urgently needed despite the increasing number of effective vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.

For future emerging pandemics, this observational study sampling design can answer many key questions, such as estimating the asymptomatic proportion of all infected cases, the probability of a given clinical presentation for a seropositive individual, or the association between characteristics of either the host or the infection and seropositivity among contacts of index individuals. We provide examples, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, of studies and analysis methods using a snowball sample and perform a simulation study that demonstrates scenarios where snowball sampling can answer these questions more efficiently than other sampling schemes.

CCUS refers to focused ultrasound performed by a treating practitioner to help detect and/or monitor life-threatening illnesses and to improve the safety of life-saving procedures. Although most critical care medicine (CCM) practitioners should have, at least, basic fluency in CCUS, academic institutions may find themselves ill-equipped to deliver comprehensive CCUS education to CCM trainees and practitioners. Challenges include a paucity of skilled faculty and lack of a standardized curriculum. In this study, we implement and evaluate a novel CCUS curriculum to resolve such concerns. METHODS: This is a pilot prospective study of implementation and evaluation of a longitudinal CCUS curriculum for CCM attendings, trainees, and nurse practitioners working across five medical-surgical intensive care units in Edmonton, Alberta (Canada). The curriculum was comprised of a custom online flipped-classroom learning environment, a one-day workshop, eight two-hour expert-led hands-on sessions, an image interpretation session, and longitudinal image/report-archiving with feedback. We used Kirkpatrick's Model of Evaluation to examine for pre/post-changes in perception (survey, Likert-scale 1-5), evidence of learning (30 question MCQ / psychomotor skill assessment), and behaviour change (survey). RESULTS: Fourteen CCM practitioners participated in the curriculum (7 attendings, 3 trainees, 4 nurse practitioners). The curriculum was halted at the end of the third month because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported increases in overall perceived performance and interpretation in CCUS (p=0.001) with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d=0.63). A comparison of mean exam scores (SD) pre- and post-curriculum were 69% ( 15%) and 78% ( 11%) with a large effect size (p=0.007, d=0.86). Psychomotor skill assessment with a standardized entrustment scale demonstrated large effect sizes across all modalities (cardiac, lung, thoracic, abdominal, vascular) with effect sizes between 0.95 and 1.28. Thirteen of the fourteen participants reported an increase use of CCUS across all modalities. While participant feedback was overwhelmingly positive, some participants wanted a longer curriculum and others reported difficulty completing CCUS exam reports while caring for the critically ill. CONCLUSIONS: A longitudinal curriculum in CCUS delivered across five medical-surgical intensive care units resulted in increases in knowledge and skill with strong effect sizes. Feedback from participants emphasized the need to lengthen the curriculum, improve workflow for CCUS exam reporting, and further increase access to direct bedside mentorship. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This curriculum provides a strong foundation for local CCUS education, a path to universal basic fluency, and a template with potential for national expansion.

In the field of gynecology oncology, we had to postpone routinary tests and check-ups, as well as attend patients that had undergone an oncological process via telephone. Due to their vulnerability, the psychological impact on this patient has been even worse than on other users of the health system. The aim in this study is to evaluate the concerns, global health status and quality of life of patients with gynecological cancer during the pandemic.MethodologyThe GineonCoVID study is a multicenter Spanish study that collect data from a national survey. The anonymous survey consists of 23 questions regarding the personal experience of the patient and modifications in health care during follow up of patient with gynecological malignancies from April to May 2021. The survey has been divided into 3 sections. In this sub-analysis the results of the questions related to anxiety, concerns, quality of life and state of mind of the interviewed patients will be evaluated.Result(s)*376 patients responded to the survey. The median age was 58 years. 43% of the patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer, 27.3% with ovarian cancer and 24.1% with cervical cancer. 39.6% and 33.6% of patients suffered anxiety and depression respectively during the pandemic. 81% of the patients report having a good quality of life during the last year. Results showed that 54.2% of the respondents are not concerns about viral infection and 67.9% consider that the risk of being infected during follow-up is low. 94% do not perceive changes in follow up, but if they do, 44% believe that clinical health care has experienced a change. 71.4% of the patients are concern about not being able to attend clinical visits.Conclusion*The pandemic could increase anxiety and depression, although it does not appear to worsen the quality of life in patients with gynecological cancer.

Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes -namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic's outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study -a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre-COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.","output":"Early adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To explore and understand the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of convalescents, the association between antibody levels and demographic factors, and the seroepidemiology of convalescents of COVID-19 till March 2021. Methods: We recruited 517 voluntary COVID-19 convalescents in Sichuan Province and collected 1,707 serum samples till March 2021. Then we reported the seroprevalence and analyzed the associated factors. Results: Recent travel history was associated with IgM levels. Convalescents who had recent travel history were less likely to be IgM antibody negative [OR = 0.232, 95% CI: (0.128, 0.420)]. Asymptomatic cases had, approximately, twice the odds of being IgM antibody negative compared with symptomatic cases [OR = 2.583, 95% CI: (1.554, 4.293)]. Participants without symptoms were less likely to be IgG seronegative than those with symptoms [OR = 0.511, 95% CI: (0.293, 0.891)]. Convalescents aged 40C59 were less likely to be IgG seronegative than those aged below 20 [OR = 0.364, 95% CI: (0.138, 0.959)]. The duration of positive IgM antibodies persisted 365 days while the IgG persisted more than 399 days. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that recent travel history might be associated with the antibody levels of IgM, while age could be associated with the antibody levels of IgG.

METHODS: Epidemiological analysis was performed on data derived from all MERS-CoV cases recorded in the disease outbreak news on WHO website between 1.1.2017 and 17.1.2018. Demographic and clinical information as well as potential contacts and probable risk factors for mortality were extracted based on laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. RESULTS: A total of 229 MERS-CoV cases, including 70 deaths (30.5%), were recorded in the disease outbreak news on world health organization website over the study period. Based on available details in this study, the case fatality rate in both genders was 30.5% (70/229) [32.1% (55/171) for males and 25.8% (15/58) for females]. The disease occurrence was higher among men [171 cases (74.7%)] than women [58 cases (25.3%)].

Maximum likelihood (ML) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) dominate the estimation of SEMs with continuous or categorical endogenous variables, respectively. When a model is correctly specified, ML and DWLS function well. But, in the face of incorrect structures or nonconvergence, their performance can seriously deteriorate. Model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimates and tests individual equations, is more robust to misspecifications, and is noniterative, thus avoiding nonconvergence. This article is an overview and tutorial on MIIV-2SLS. It reviews the six major steps in using MIIV-2SLS: (a) model specification; (b) model identification; (c) latent to observed (L2O) variable transformation; (d) finding MIIVs; (e) using 2SLS; and (f) tests of overidentified equations. Each step is illustrated using a running empirical example from Reisenzein's (1986) randomized experiment on helping behavior. We also explain and illustrate the analytic conditions under which an equation estimated with MIIV-2SLS is robust to structural misspecifications.

More recently, it was proposed that they could play a role in the antigen presentation to T lymphocytes but contradictory results have been published both concerning their surface expressed molecules and the T lymphocyte responses in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The use of either AECII cell line or fresh cells could explain the observed discrepancies. Thus, this study aimed at defining the most relevant model of accessory antigen presenting cells by carefully comparing the two models for their expression of surface molecules necessary for efficient antigen presentation. METHODS: We have compared by flow cytometry the surface expression of the major markers involved in the immunological synapse on the A549 cell line, the most popular model of type II alveolar epithelial cells, and freshly isolated cells. HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, ICOS-L, CD54, CD58 surface expression were studied in resting conditions as well as after IFN-/TNF- treatment, two inflammatory cytokines, known to modulate some of these markers. RESULTS: The major difference found between the two cells types was the very low surface expression of HLA-DR on the A549 cell line compared to its constitutive expression on freshly isolated AECII. The surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules from the B7 family was very low for the CD86 (B7-2) and ICOS-L (B7-H2) and absent for CD80 (B7-1) on both freshly isolated cells and A549 cell line. Neither IFN- nor TNF- could increase the expression of these classical co-stimulatory molecules. However CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3) adhesion molecules, known to be implicated in B7 independent co-stimulatory signals, were well expressed on the two cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive expression of MHC class I and II molecules as well as alternative co-stimulatory molecules by freshly isolated AECII render these cells a good model to study antigen presentation.","output":"Phenotypic characteristics of human type II alveolar epithelial cells suitable for antigen presentation to T lymphocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) causes a chronic encephalomyelitis in susceptible mice, with histological evidence of demyelination in the spinal cord. After intranasal inoculation, virus spreads retrogradely to several brain structures along neuroanatomic projections to the main olfactory bulb. In the absence of experimental intervention, mice become moribund before the spinal cord is infected. In this study, infusions of anti-MHV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were administered to protect mice from the MHV-JHM-induced acute encephalitis and to allow survival until virus spread to the spinal cord. Under these conditions, virus was observed to enter specific layers (primarily laminae V to VII) in the gray matter of the upper spinal cord, consistent with transneuronal spread. While the brain structures which are the sources for virus spread to the spinal cord cannot be determined with certainty, the ventral reticular nucleus is likely to be important since it is consistently and extensively labeled in all mice and receives projections from subsequently infected areas of the spinal cord. After initial entry into the gray matter, virus rapidly spread to the white matter of the spinal cord. During the early stages of this process, extensive infection of astrocytes was noted, suggesting that cell-to-cell spread via these glial cells is an important part of this process. Reports from other laboratories using cultured cells strongly suggested that astrocytes serve as important regulators of oligodendrocyte function and, by extrapolation, have a major role in vivo in the processes of both demyelination and remyelination. Thus, our results not only outline the probable pathway used by MHV-JHM to infect the white matter of the spinal cord but also, with the assumption that infection of astrocytes leads to subsequent dysfunction, raise the possibility that infection of these cells contributes to the demyelinating process.","output":"Spread of a neurotropic coronavirus to spinal cord white matter via neurons and astrocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: SARS-COV-2 is a pathogenic agent belonging to the coronavirus family, responsible for the current global world pandemic Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is the receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 ACE-2 is a type I transmembrane metallo-carboxypeptidase involved in the Renin-Angiotensin pathway By analyzing two independent databases, ACE-2 was identified in several human tissues including the thyroid Although some cases of COVID-19-related subacute thyroiditis were recently described, direct proof for the expression of the ACE-2 mRNA in thyroid cells is still lacking Aim of the present study was to investigate by RT-PCR whether the mRNA encoding for ACE-2 is present in human thyroid cells METHODS: RT-PCR was performed on in vitro ex vivo study on thyroid tissue samples (15 patients undergoing thyroidectomy for benign thyroid nodules) and primary thyroid cell cultures RESULTS: The ACE-2 mRNA was detected in all surgical thyroid tissue samples (n = 15) Compared with two reporter genes (GAPDH: 0 052  0 0026 Cycles(-1);-actin: 0 044  0 0025 Cycles(-1);ACE-2: 0 035  0 0024 Cycles(-1)), the mean level of transcript expression for ACE-2 mRNA was abundant The expression of ACE-2 mRNA in follicular cells was confirmed by analyzing primary cultures of thyroid cells, which expressed the ACE-2 mRNA at levels similar to tissues CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that the mRNA encoding for the ACE-2 receptor is expressed in thyroid follicular cells, making them a potential target for SARS-COV-2 entry Future clinical studies in patients with COVID-19 will be required for increase our understanding of the thyroid repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"Detection of SARS-COV-2 receptor ACE-2 mRNA in thyroid cells: a clue for COVID-19-related subacute thyroiditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Based on the fundamental role of nutrition in immune function and the well-documented association between Mediterranean diet consumption and risk reduction for chronic diseases that are comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, we hypothesized that there would be a relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and COVID-19 cases and related deaths. In this perspective, we examined the association between regional adherence to a Mediterranean diet and COVID-19 cases and deaths using an ecological study design. We observed that Mediterranean diet adherence was negatively associated with both COVID-19 cases and related deaths across 17 regions in Spain and that the relationship remained when adjusted for factors of well-being. We also observed a negative association between Mediterranean diet adherence and COVID-19 related deaths across 23 countries when adjusted for factors of well-being and physical inactivity. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet - likely due to the polyphenol content of the diet - may be a biological basis to explain our findings. However, there are confounding factors unrelated to dietary factors driving COVID-19 cases and related deaths across the regions in Spain and the 23 countries examined in our analysis.

METHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization was employed. Finally, 14 independent lead SNPs remained in the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium. These SNPs of relative carbohydrate, sugar, fat, and protein intake at the level of genome-wide significance (pa??< a??510-8) were used as instrumental variables.

These measures also have an impact on peoples daily life (closure of school/businesses, teleworking, recommendation to stay at home). This can cause stress on social, economic and psychological levels and thereby can trigger domestic violence. Besides, confinement also fosters social isolation, which can complicate help seeking behaviour. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of domestic violence during the coronavirus crisis and to assess whether there is an association between domestic violence and social isolation. METHODS: Several online COVID-19 Health Surveys were organised among Belgian residents aged 18+ via snowball sampling. This study is based on the second (April 2020) and the sixth survey (March 2021). After excluding 1-person households and missing data, the sample size was respectively 25,251 and 12,589. Weighted prevalence of domestic violence was evaluated for the two surveys. The association (OR; 95% CI; p-value) between domestic violence and subjective social isolation was assessed with logistic regression stratified by survey and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: In April 2020, 4.0% of the adult population reported being a victim of domestic violence (1.2% in the Health Interview Survey 2018); in March 2021, this was 6.2%. In April 2020, victims of domestic violence had higher odds of being unsatisfied with their social contacts (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08C1.44; p < .05), weak social support (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.97C2.58; p < .0001) and having less confidence in health care services (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.13C1.71; p < .05). In March 2021, victims had higher odds of being unsatisfied with their social contacts (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.08C1.56; p < .05) and weak social support (OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 2.04C2.84; p < .0001), and social (OR = 2.64; 95% CI: 2.23C3.13; p < .0001) and emotional loneliness (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.80C2.73; p < .0001).

From witnessing a technological boom and awareness about the environment to renewable energy and conscious use of natural resources, the current century had offered a lot in the previous two decades. However, the question of natural resources being a curse or a blessing to the natural resource-producing economies is still unanswered and gathers many scholars' attention. The current study investigates the volatility of natural resources, oil and gold, and studies the impact of volatility in natural resource prices for resource-producing economies. The global market for crude oil has experienced significant downturns during the last two decades, the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid 19 crisis of 2020, for instance. Compared to that, the global gold market has experienced relatively less impactful downturns during the same period. We explore how the volatility in oil and gold prices impact the growth of the resource-producing economies. The study is conducted on the top oil-producing countries and the top gold-producing countries on data from 2000 to 2020. The study finds that in the long run, the volatility in both oil and gold markets could be detrimental to the economic growth as measured by the GDP for the resource-producing economies. Our research also shows that the impact of the volatility in prices on the growth of economies is not consistent for all resource-producing economies in the short-term using PMG/ARDL methodology. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"The volatility of natural resource prices and its impact on the economic growth for natural resource-dependent economies: A comparison of oil and gold dependent economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The physiological changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of complications in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS Participants (n = 326) with body mass index (BMI) 30-40 kg/m(2) were randomized to endoscopic DBS treatment plus diet and exercise (DUO, n = 187) or sham endoscopy plus diet and exercise alone (DIET, n = 139). Co-primary endpoints were a between-group comparison of percent excess weight loss (%EWL) and DUO subject responder rate, both at 24 weeks. Thereafter DUO patients had the DBS retrieved followed by 24 additional weeks of counseling; DIET patients were offered DBS treatment. RESULTS Mean BMI was 35.4. Both primary endpoints were met. DUO weight loss was over twice that of DIET. DUO patients had significantly greater %EWL at 24 weeks (25.1% intent-to-treat (ITT), 27.9% completed cases (CC, n = 167) compared with DIET patients (11.3% ITT, P = .004, 12.3% CC, n = 126).

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was no systematic study on the infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients who are on RRT. Methods We searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT. The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points. Results Of 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with RRT was 3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average prevalence. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was 18.06% (95% CI 14.09-22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98%.

LSB was performed using a developed standardized 2-point anchoring and zigzag tacking of Parietex? Parastomal Mesh (PCO-PM) technique. RESULTS Out of 16 cases, 14 were primary and 2 recurrent hernias; 13 were para-end colostomy and 3 were para-ileal conduit (PIC) hernias. The median longitudinal and transverse diameters of the hernia orifice were 5 cm (2.5-7 cm) and 4.2 cm (2-6 cm), respectively. Five cases had a concomitant midline incisional hernia, which was simultaneously repaired. In all cases, the mesh was placed without deflection. The median operation time was 193 (75-386) min. Perioperative complications occurred in two cases (13 %) with PIC, one intra-operatively and the other postoperatively. The intra-operative complication was enterotomy close to the ureteroenteric anastomosis of the ileal conduit; it was repaired through a mini-laparotomy. LSB was accomplished without any subsequent postoperative complications. The postoperative complication was ureteral obstruction that required creation of nephrostomy. Mini-laparotomy was necessary in those two cases (13 %) because of intra-operative enterotomy and severe intra-abdominal adhesions. The median postoperative length of stay was 9 (5-14) days. No recurrence was observed with a median follow-up of 14.5 (2-41) months.

Such arrays of repetitive and highly organized structures are recognized by the immune system as pathogen-associated structural patterns (PASPs), which are characteristic for pathogen surfaces. In contrast, coronaviruses are large particles with long spikes (S protein) embedded in a fluid membrane.

The median follow-up for OS was 131 months (IQR 67-191) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 111 months (58-161) for chemotherapy alone. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 071 [984% CI 059-086]; p<00001) and PFS (HR 068 [98 % CI 056-081]; p<00001) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of five or more (minimum follow-up 121 months). Additional results showed significant improvement in OS, along with PFS benefit, in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of one or more and all randomly assigned patients. Among all treated patients, 462 (59%) of 782 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 341 (44%) of 767 patients in the chemotherapy alone group had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (25%) were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups. 16 (2%) deaths in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and four (1%) deaths in the chemotherapy alone group were considered to be treatment-related. No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION Nivolumab is the first PD-1 inhibitor to show superior OS, along with PFS benefit and an acceptable safety profile, in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy represents a new standard first-line treatment for these patients.

The SleepQuest survey comprised a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and attitudes towards sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures.Results3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18-91) completed the baseline data with 2781 participants followed up. Results showed sleep quality was negatively affected by the first UK lockdown restriction [mean PSQI at baseline 8.12 (2.92)] however from baseline to follow up, sleep quality improved (mean PSQI Difference=2.21;95% CI=[2.12,2.33.]) Factors that predicted poor prolonged sleep quality were baseline sleep quality (P<0.001), anxiety (P<0.001) and attitudes towards sleep (P<0.01). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in owl (p=0.0002) and not lark (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype.DiscussionWe have provided evidence to suggest anxiety and dysfunctional attitudes towards sleep predicted poorer prolonged sleep quality.

With respect to dermatology, vehicle emissions by patients traveling to and from appointments are an important factor influencing climate change. This study was undertaken to determine the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by managing isotretinoin virtually at West Virginia University Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 25 to December 1, 2020, where travel data were acquired and converted to emission data. RESULTS: 5,137 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents were prevented by managing isotretinoin virtually during the study period. 49 400 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents would be prevented annually. This is the emission load released when 24 690 kg of coal are burned. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental impact studies in the field of dermatology remain limited. GHG emissions were significantly reduced by virtually managing isotretinoin at a single institution. The practice of dermatology could reduce its carbon footprint by managing isotretinoin virtually, even in non-pandemic periods. Given that isotretinoin management represents a small percentage of the overall carbon footprint associated with dermatology, dermatologists should identify other conditions amenable to virtual medicine to produce greater environmental impact.","output":"The positive environmental impact of virtual isotretinoin management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to surges in the demand for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. However, little in-depth evidence is known about the application of ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective multicenter cohort study included 88 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and received ECMO therapy at seven designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between weaned and non-weaned ECMO patients. The patients were followed until June 30, 2020. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with unsuccessful ECMO weaning. Propensity score matching was used to match patients who received veno-venous ECMO with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-only therapy. The primary endpoint, 120-day all-cause mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospitalization, was compared using a mixed-effect Cox model. Results Of 88 patients who received ECMO therapy, 27 and 61 patients were and were not successfully weaned from ECMO, respectively. Additionally, 15, 15, and 65 patients were further weaned from IMV, discharged from hospital, or died during hospitalization, respectively. A lymphocyte count  0.5  10 9 /L and D-dimer concentration > 4  the upper limit of normal at ICU admission, a peak PaCO 2 > 60 mmHg at 24 hours before ECMO initiation, and no tracheotomy performed during the ICU stay were independently associated with lower odds of ECMO weaning. In the propensity score-matched analysis, a mixed-effect Cox model detected a lower hazard ratio for 120-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission during hospitalization in the ECMO group, as compared with the IMV-only group. Conclusion Patients in Wuhan who received ECMO therapy had a relatively high mortality rate. This outcome may be largely attributable to resource-limited situations during the COVID-19 outbreak. In future, the presence of lymphocytopenia and higher D-dimer concentrations at ICU admission and hypercapnia at 24 hours before ECMO initiation could help to identify patients with a poor prognosis. Moreover, tracheotomy could facilitate weaning from ECMO. Despite the high mortality, ECMO was associated with improved outcomes relative to IMV-only therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"ECMO Therapy for Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic poses enormous social challenges, especially during lockdown. Recently, the second lockdown started in the Netherlands. We aimed to investigate and compare the psychosocial effects of corona measures during lockdown in memory clinic (pre\\\\)dementia patients and their caregivers. METHOD: During second lockdown, n=137 symptomatic patients (age=67.76.54, 36.5%F, MMSE = 24.44.7; n=82 dementia, n=55 MCI), n=244 cognitively normal (age=63.67.56, 38.9%F, MMSE = 28.81.18; SCD) and n=198 caregivers of Alzheimer Center Amsterdam completed a survey on psychosocial effects of corona. Questions related to loneliness, worries for faster cognitive decline, psychological and behavioral problems. In a subset of patients (n=169) and caregivers (n=38) we were able to compare their answers to answers on a similar survey completed during first lockdown (May 2020). RESULT: In total, n=17 (4.5%) patients [n=3 (2.2%) symptomatic, n=14 (5.7%) cognitively normal] and n=8 (4%) caregivers reported a positive test result for COVID\\\\19. Over one\\\\third of caregivers reported worries for faster cognitive decline [n=76 (38%)] and behavioral problems [n=70 (35%)] in patients. Feelings of loneliness were experienced by n=23 (17%) symptomatic patients, n=44 (18%) cognitively normal and n=50 (25%) caregivers. One quarter of patients [n=78 (25%)] reported more depressive feelings during lockdown [n=27 (20%) symptomatic, n=51 (21%) cognitively normal]. More feelings of fatigue were reported by n=23 (17%) symptomatic patients, n=46 (19%) cognitively normal, and n=67 (34%) caregivers. Comparing results to those obtained during the first lockdown, feelings of loneliness [(2)=26.4, p<.001 in patients, (2)=10.3, p<.001 in caregivers] and anxiety [(2)=25.9, p<.001 in patients, (2)=6.69, p=.010 in caregivers] increased.

Anabolic and catabolic hormonal profiles were assessed across the following day. Postprandial muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was assessed between 13:00 and 15:00 and gene markers of muscle protein degradation were assessed at 13:00. Acute sleep deprivation reduced muscle protein synthesis by 18% (CON: 0.072  0.015% vs. DEP: 0.059  0.014%h-1 , p = .040). In addition, sleep deprivation increased plasma cortisol by 21% (p = .030) and decreased plasma testosterone by 24% (p = .029). No difference was found in the markers of protein degradation. A single night of total sleep deprivation is sufficient to induce anabolic resistance and a procatabolic environment.

New variants of the virus are frequently emerging leading to new waves of infection and re-introduction of control measures. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of containment strategies implemented in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Real-world data for COVID-19 cases was retrieved for the period Jan 1 to May 1, 2020 from a number of different sources, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Facebook, Epidemic Forecasting and Google Mobility Reports. We analyzed data for 18 countries/regions that deployed containment strategies such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, stay-at-home requests, school/public events closure, social distancing, and exposure history information management (digital contact tracing, DCT). Primary outcome measure was the change in the number of new cases over 30 days before and after deployment of a control measure. We also compared the effectiveness of centralized versus decentralized DCT. Time series data for COVID-19 were analyzed using Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend tests to investigate the impact of these measures on changes in the number of new cases. The rate of change in the number of new cases was compared using M-K z-values and Sens slope. RESULTS: In spite of the widespread implementation of conventional strategies such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing, school closures, and stay-at-home requests, analysis revealed that these measures could not prevent the spread of the virus. However, countries which adopted DCT with centralized data storage were more likely to contain the spread. CONCLUSIONS: Centralized DCT was more effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. Early implementation of centralized DCT should be considered in future outbreaks.

METHODS: Using open data repository with daily infected, recovered and death cases in the period between March 2020 and April 2021, a descriptive analysis was performed. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery model was used to estimate the effective productive number (Rt). The duration taken from Rt > 1 to Rt < 1 and case load were first modelled by using the compound Poisson method. Machine learning analysis using the K-means clustering method was further adopted to classify patterns of community-acquired outbreaks worldwide. RESULTS: The global estimated Rt declined after the first surge of COVID-19 pandemic but there were still two major surges of epidemics occurring in September 2020 and March 2021, respectively, and numerous episodes due to various extents of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).

OBJECTIVES: To explore resilience, burnout and wellbeing for UK pharmacists in patient-facing roles, including individual and organisational factors that align to the ABC-X theoretical model of the dynamic process of resilience. METHODS: A non-experimental pragmatist research design was adopted, with a cross-sectional online survey distributed via social media and professional networks between June and July 2020. Quantitative data aligned to a positivist research paradigm was collected using validated scores, to statistically analyse wellbeing, burnout and resilience. Qualitative textual data, consistent with an interpretivist research paradigm, were analysed following an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: A total of 199 surveys from pharmacists working within community, hospital and GP sectors were analysed. Wellbeing scores were strongly correlated to resilience scores. Wellbeing and resilience scores were both inversely correlated with burnout scores. Two-thirds of participants were classified as high-risk within the burnout scales. Key stressors were highlighted by participants, who described how individual resources and perceptions shaped their experience, which overall contributed to their burnout. Organisations that supported pharmacists embraced change and quickly adopted new ways of working, such as teleconsultations, flexible and remote working, redesign of workflow, alongside clear guidance. However, there was also reported frustration at lack of, slow or conflicting guidance from employers. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing evidence base for how individuals are affected by adverse events in a dynamic environment, alongside the role that employers can play in supporting individual and organisational resilience. It provides an opportunity to learn from pharmacists' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a call to action for healthcare organisations to rebuild and invest resources into sustained support for staff wellbeing.","output":"I'm at breaking point; Exploring pharmacists' resilience, coping and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of pharmacists and innovation of pharmacy interventions for COVID-19 patients in China.

However, from the viewpoint of decision makers, due to lower external validity, practical results of efficacy research are often not in line with the huge investments made over decades. METHOD: We conducted a narrative review. With a special focus on homeopathy, we give an overview on cohort, comparative cohort, case-control and cross-sectional study designs and explain guidelines and tools that help to improve the quality of observational studies, such as the STROBE Statement, RECORD, GRACE and ENCePP Guide. RESULTS: Within the conventional medical research field, two types of arguments have been employed in favor of observational studies. First, observational studies allow for a more generalizable and robust estimation of effects in clinical practice, and if cohorts are large enough, there is no over-estimation of effect sizes, as is often feared. We argue that observational research is needed to balance the current over-emphasis on internal validity at the expense of external validity. Thus, observational research can be considered an important research tool to describe \\"real-world\\" care settings and can assist with the design and inform the results of randomised controlled trails.

However, no study has clearly identified whether and how work connectivity behavior after-hours (WCBA) affects employees work and family status. Therefore, using role theory, we explored the mechanisms by which WCBA affects employees thriving at work and family through workCfamily enrichment and workCfamily conflict, and compared the impact of different levels of support for family members on workCfamily enrichment and conflict, using the JohnsonCNeyman method. Our analysis of two-wave data from 257 employees led to the following findings. (1) WCBA had a positive impact on thriving at work, but not on family. (2) There is a double-edged sword effect on the impact of WCBA on thriving at work, meaning that workCfamily enrichment can positively influence thriving at work and negatively influence workCfamily conflict. (3) There is a double-edged sword effect on the impact of WCBA on thriving at family, meaning that workCfamily enrichment can positively influence thriving at family and negatively influence workCfamily conflict. (4) The support of family members moderates the double-edged sword effect between WCBA and thriving at work, in that it can strengthen the positive effects of workCfamily enrichment (below 3.32 points or above 4.19 points) and weaken the negative effects of workCfamily conflicts (below 4.28 points). (5) Support from family members reinforces the positive impact of workCfamily enrichment (above 3.46 points) on thriving at family.

Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with respiratory physicians from around Australia between April and December 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS Almost all hospitals (n = 38, 97%) held multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) for diagnosing IPF, with 90% of multidisciplinary teams including expert respiratory physicians and radiologists; however, rheumatologists, interstitial lung disease nurses and a histopathologist were often not available. More than 90% of institutions had access to oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation and advanced care planning, but access to psychological support and clinical trials was limited (53% and 58%, respectively). Fifteen respiratory physicians (27% regional) were interviewed. Approaches to diagnosis, treatment and access to referral services were generally consistent with best practice guidance; however, regional respondents reported barriers related to inadequate staffing, lack of a nurse coordinator, inadequate access to clinical trials and funding models.

Challenges with training deep networks to identify COVID-19 signatures in lung ultrasound data are that large datasets do not yet exist;disease signatures are sparse, but are spatially and temporally correlated;and signatures may appear sporadically in ultrasound video sequences. We propose an attention-based video model that is specifically designed to detect these disease signatures, and leverage a knowledge transfer approach to overcome existing limitations in data availability. In our design, a convolutional neural network extracts spatially encoded features, which are fed to a transformer encoder to capture temporal information across the frames and focus on the most important frames.

Although there is ample empirical evidence available on dietary changes within the Indian context, very limited evidence exists about the factors influencing these dietary modifications and changes in culinary behaviours during COVID-19 lockdown. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore the views of Indian household food gatekeepers towards meal planning, food purchasing, and meal preparation during the pandemic and its associated lockdowns. A convenience sample of 34 female gatekeepers from the Mumbai metropolis participated in online interviews. Interviews were conducted in English and Hindi (then translated in English), audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Underpinned by Template Analysis technique, transcribed data were analysed manually and using the NVivo software program. The interview structure guided the development of themes. The emerging themes included were: Increased household cooking; Involvement of children and male members in food-related activities; Experimentation in the kitchen; Adoption of meal planning skills; Increase in online food shopping; Bulk buying; Shortage of food items; Reduced consumption of outside home food; Increased variety of home-cooked meals; Increase in snacking and overall food intake; Determinants of food choices; and Family meals-a new norm. In the light of these findings, developing family-focussed, web-based nutrition programs to enhance gatekeepers' and their families' food literacy including declarative and procedural nutritional knowledge would be beneficial. The importance of organisational culinary behaviours such as planning meals in advance, shopping with a food list should be promoted to prevent hoarding and subsequently reduce strain on the food supply system.

CONCLUSION: After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our university hospital HCWs was around 2.8%, which is slightly higher than the seroprevalence in the general population in our region. We believe it would be advisable to perform additional seroprevalence studies during the second wave of the epidemic.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare workers in a university hospital in Mallorca, Spain, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new highly pathogenic strain of influenza virus, H5N1, has emerged causing severe outbreaks in poultry and high mortality rates when humans are infected. The threat of a new influenza pandemic has prompted countries to draft national strategic preparedness plans to prevent, contain and mitigate the next human influenza pandemic. To evaluate preparedness for an influenza pandemic in the African region we analysed African national preparedness plans available in the public domain. A data extraction tool, based on a World Health Organization checklist for influenza epidemic preparedness, was designed in consultation with pandemic influenza planning experts and experts on the region's public health challenges. Thirty-five plans were identified and available from 53 African countries. Most plans are relatively robust in addressing detection and containment of influenza in animals but strategic preparedness to respond to pandemic human influenza is weak. In most plans communication strategies have been developed with the aim to raise awareness of transmission factors and promote hygiene measures. By contrast, the human health care sector is ill-prepared. Case management, triage procedures, identification of health care facilities for patient treatment (including home care and provisions for the distribution and administration of pharmaceuticals) are poorly addressed by most plans. The maintenance of essential services in the event of a pandemic is absent from most plans. Whilst many African countries have strategic pandemic influenza preparedness plans, most are developmental in nature and lack operational clarity, or focus principally on the containment of avian influenza rather than pandemic human influenza. Clear strategies, that are operational, need to be developed that reflect the realities of national context and resource constraints and that meet national objectives. These objectives need also to be coherent with international imperatives such that the global threat of pandemic influenza can be met effectively and efficiently.","output":"Pandemic influenza preparedness in Africa is a profound challenge for an already distressed region: analysis of national preparedness plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Western European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains cause limited and mild clinical signs whereas more virulent strains are circulating in Eastern Europe.

Notably, the recent development of the HCV cell culture infection system now allows not only for the study of the entire viral life cycle, but also for the screening of inhibitors against all aspects of HCV infection. However, in order to screen libraries of potential antiviral compounds, it is necessary to develop a highly reproducible, accurate assay for HCV infection adaptable for high-throughput screening (HTS) automation. Using an internally quenched 5-FAM/QXL 520 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate containing the HCV NS3 peptide cleavage sequence, we report the development of a simple, mix-and-measure, homogenous, cell-based HCV infection assay amendable for HTS. This assay makes use of synchronized, nondividing human hepatoma-derived Huh7 cells, which support more-reproducible long-term HCV infection and can be readily scaled down to a 96-well-plate format. We demonstrate that this stable cell culture method eliminates common problems associated with standard cell-based HTS, such as cell culture variability, poor reproducibility, and low signal intensity. Importantly, this HCV FRET assay not only can identify inhibitors that act throughout the viral life cycle as effectively as more-standard HCV assays, such as real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, but also exhibits a high degree of accuracy with limited signal variation (i.e., Z' > or = 0.6), providing the basis for a robust HTS campaign for screening compound libraries and identifying novel HCV antivirals.","output":"Development of a cell-based hepatitis C virus infection fluorescent resonance energy transfer assay for high-throughput antiviral compound screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world deeply, with more than 14,000,000 people infected and nearly 600,000 deaths.

METHODS: We scoped for relevant literatures published during 1st December 2019 to 16th July 2020 based on three databases using English and Chinese languages. We reviewed and analyzed the relevant outcomes. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to have a higher transmission rate compared to SARS and MERS and involved 4 stages of evolution. The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.32 (95% CI:3.24-3.39), the incubation period was 5.24 days (95% CI:3.97-6.50, 5 studies) on average, and the average time for symptoms onset varied by countries. Common clinical spectrums identified included fever (38.1-39.0 C), cough and fatigue, with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) being the most common complication reported. Body temperatures above 39.0 C, dyspnea, and anorexia were more common symptoms in severe patients. Aged over 65 years old, having co-morbidities, and developing complications were the commonest high-risk factors associated with severe conditions. Leucopenia and lymphopenia were the most common signs of infection while liver and kidney damage were rare but may cause bad outcomes for patients. The bilateral, multifocal Ground-Glass Opacification (GGO) on peripheral, and the consolidative pulmonary opacity were the most frequent CT results and the tendency of mortality rates differed by region.

In a structured recruitment process, all German SPHC teams (n=357) were invited to participate. Results From 10/10/2020 to 07/01/2021, 154 SPHC teams participated (response rate 43%). They described clear effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their activities. Despite pandemic-related problems with staff availability (78.5%), patient care was ensured without major problems. The number of patients to be cared for remained stable for most teams, was increasing for some, and decreasing only for a few. A central factor was the switch from direct contact with patients and their relatives to telephone contact. Additional complicating factors were the general avoidance of contacts, compliance with hygiene regulations for necessary personal contacts, and pandemic-related uncertainties and fears, both among the team itself and among relatives and patients. The procurement of protective equipment was a challenge during the first wave. Problems in collaboration with network partners (e. g., nursing homes and volunteer hospice services) had decreased over the course of the pandemic, but were greater than before in all areas. Many measures to cope with the pandemic challenges were implemented, others were assessed as useful but not implemented, and others as not useful or feasible.

In this proof-of-concept study, the combination of a well-established intraluminal sampling technique with high-resolution manometric measurements in the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated. This new combination of in vivo techniques proved to be feasible from a practical point of view and yielded valuable additional information regarding intraluminal drug behaviour. As a first application, the link between fasted state gastric motility and (in)homogeneous distribution of an orally administered drug in the stomach was investigated in healthy subjects. To this end, drug concentrations were measured in different regions of the stomach after oral administration of a commercially available drug product (Gabbroral?, 250mg paromomycin) during a specific period of gastric contractile activity. A clear trend towards better mixing of an orally administered drug with gastric contents was observed when dosed in the presence of gastric contractions, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of the drug throughout the stomach compared to dosing in the absence of gastric contractions.","output":"Exploring the link between gastric motility and intragastric drug distribution in man."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The in vitro interactions of isavuconazole with colistin were evaluated against 15 clinical Candida auris isolates by a microdilution checkerboard technique based on the EUCAST reference method for antifungal susceptibility testing and by agar diffusion using isavuconazole gradient concentration strips with or without colistin incorporated RPMI agar.

It has affected millions of people around the world and altered human life and activities as we once knew. The high prevalence as well as an extended period of incubations which usually does not present with symptoms have played a formidable role in the transmission and infection of millions. A lot of research has been carried out on developing suitable treatment and effective preventive measures for the control of the pandemic. Preventive strategies which include social distancing, use of masks, washing of hands, and contact tracing have been effective in slowing the spread of the virus; however, the infectious nature of the SARS-COV-2 has made these strategies unable to eradicate its spread. In addition, the continuous increase in the number of cases and death, as well as the appearance of several variants of the virus, has necessitated the development of effective and safe vaccines in a bid to ensure that human activities can return to normalcy. Nanotechnology has been of great benefit in the design of vaccines as nano-sized materials have been known to aid the safe and effective delivery of antigens as well as serve as suitable adjuvants to potentiate responses to vaccines.

Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Len, Spain (865,096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2<300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or those who died in the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then, we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses (250 mg of methylprednisolone for three days), and 133 were not. 30.3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulse group and 42.9% (57/133) in the nonexposed cohort.

This lack of male-focused programming may be in part because traditional weight loss programs are unappealing for what is considered a hard-to-reach population. One program that appears to have such appeal for men is the MAN v FAT Football (MVFF) program, based out of the United Kingdom, which is designed for men with a body mass index of (or greater than) 27.5. MVFF encourages mens participation in a community-based weight loss program that incentivizes weight loss through participation in a football league, and since 2016 MVFF has supported the weight loss efforts of several thousand men. Using MVFF as an exemplar, our aim was to derive insight into how men experience a male-only competitive, sport-based weight loss program. We recruited twenty-seven players (Mage = 41.13, SD = 9.93), and ten coaches (Mage = 31.8, SD = 11.55) from program locations throughout the United Kingdom. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified several appraisal aspects of the program that players and coaches considered important, including the appeal of sport, competition on a level playing field, being part of a team, camaraderie, accountability, men sharing issues with other men, gender-sensitized environment, likeminded and similar men, and perceptions that traditional weight loss programs are tailored towards women. Player experiences (i.e., competence and enjoyment) and functional supports in the program (e.g., player handbook, weight loss coach) were reported to drive outcomes of effective weight loss and program retention. Interventions aiming to target men may be more successful working with rather than against formulations of identity such as masculinities, and this can be achieved by tailoring program content (e.g., messaging), settings (e.g., among men sharing similar characteristics such as body-type or goals), and mode of delivery (e.g., through organized sports, and leveraging competition to drive healthy behaviours).","output":"Overweight and obese mens experiences in a sport-based weight loss intervention for men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Hyperactivation of the immune system through obesity and diabetes may enhance infection severity complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease. Objectives: to determine the circulatory biomarkers for macrophage activation at baseline and after serum glucose normalization in obese type 2 diabetes (OT2D) subjects. Methods: A case-controlled interventional pilot study in OT2D (n=23) and control subjects (n=23). Subjects underwent hyperinsulinemic clamp normalizing serum glucose. Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-hour of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Results: . Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers CXCL9 and CXCL10 were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFG-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D. Conventional mediators of both M1 and M2 macrophage activation markers (IFN-, IL-4, IL-13) were not altered. No changes were observed in plasma levels of M1/M2 macrophage activation markers in OT2D in response to acute normalization of glycemia. Conclusion: In the basal state, macrophage activation markers are elevated, and these reflect the expression of circulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, that were not changed by glucose normalisation.

Reported estimates have varied greatly, but many have derived from biased samples, and inadequate testing methods. Objective: To estimate the range of valid seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations, and compare these seroprevalence estimates with the cumulative cases seen in the same population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints from January 2020 to 25 May 2020 that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of either the general community or of defined sub-populations, such healthcare workers and other organizations. Results: Of the 837 studies identified, 49 were assessed and 14 were includable. Included studies represented 10 countries and 100,557 subjects: 9 from randomly selected populations, 2 from healthcare workers, 2 from industry populations, and 1of parturient women. The seroprevalence proportions in 10 studies ranged between 1%-10%, and 2 study estimates under 1%, and 2 over 10% - from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt in Germany and from Northwest Iran. The two studies in healthcare workers, in Italy and Spain, had seroprevalence rates at higher range of estimates, with the Barcelona hospitals having a higher rate than the Spanish national survey. For only one study was the seroprevalence estimate higher than the cumulative incidence, though these were proximate for several studies. In five studies, the seroprevalence was similar to the cumulative case numbers in the same population. For seropositive cases not previously detected as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 mostly less than 10% with the level of infection lower in the general community, suggesting levels well below herd immunity. The similarity of seroprevalence and reported cases is several studies, and high symptom rates in seropositive cases suggest that gaps between seroprevalence rates and reported cases are likely due to undertesting of symptomatic people.","output":"Estimating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections: systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has caused adverse impacts on different aspects of life around the globe, including travelers mode choice behavior. To make their travel safe, transportation planners and policymakers need to understand peoples perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 transmission in different travel modes.

The study used a five-point Likert scale to measure the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission in each travel mode. Using ordinal logistic regression models, the study explored the factors that influenced the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission in different travel modes. The study found that people perceived a very high risk of viral transmission in public transport (bus), moderate risk in shared modes (rickshaw, auto-rickshaw, ridesharing), and very low risk in private modes (private car, motorcycle/scooter, walking, cycling). Such high-risk perception of viral transmission in public transport and shared modes might lead to a modal shift to private modes, which would worsen urban transport problems and undermine sustainable transportation goals. The study also found that socio-economic factors (gender, age, income) significantly influenced perceived risks in all travel modes.

We argue there are high expected social returns to investigating the scope for lowering the dosage of some COVID-19 vaccines. While existing evidence is not dispositive, available clinical data on the immunogenicity of lower doses combined with evidence of a high correlation between neutralizing antibody response and vaccine efficacy suggests that half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could generate high levels of protection, particularly against severe disease and death, while potentially expanding supply by 450 million to 1.55 billion doses per month, based on supply projections for 2021. An epidemiological model suggests that even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses, vaccinating more people faster could substantially reduce total infections and deaths. The costs of further testing alternative doses are much lower than the expected public health and economic benefits. However, commercial incentives to generate evidence on fractional dosing are weak, suggesting that testing may not occur without public investment.

However, recent evidence also identifies some persons with arthritis experience guilt or worry while using a wearable if they are not as active as they feel they should be. Questions remain around how persons with knee OA experience benefits or downsides using a wearable in their everyday lives. Better understanding is needed if wearables are to be incorporated in arthritis self-management in ethically aware ways. OBJECTIVE: Using an ethics lens, we aimed to describe a range of experiences from persons with knee OA who used a wearable during a physical activity counseling intervention study. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of qualitative interviews nested within a randomized controlled trial. Guided by phenomenography, we explored the experiences of persons with knee OA following participation in a physical activity counseling intervention that involved using a Fitbit Flex and biweekly phone calls with a study physiotherapist (PT) in an 8-week period. Benefits or downsides experienced in participants relationships with themselves or the study PT when using the wearable were identified using a relational ethics lens. RESULTS: Interviews with 21 participants (12 females and 9 males) aged 40 to 82 years were analyzed. Education levels ranged from high school graduates (4/21, 19%) to bachelors degrees or above (11/21, 52%). We identified 3 categories of description: (1) participants experienced their wearable as a motivating or nagging influence to be more active, depending on how freely they were able to make autonomous choices about physical activity in their everyday lives; (2) some participants felt a sense of accomplishment from seeing progress in their wearable data, which fueled their motivation; (3) for some participants, sharing wearable data helped to build mutual trust in their relationship with the study PT. However, they also expressed there was potential for sharing wearable data to undermine this trust, particularly if this data was inaccurate. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide an early glimpse into positive and negative emotional impacts of using a wearable that can be experienced by participants with knee OA when participating in a randomized controlled trial to support physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study that uses a relational ethics lens to explore how persons with arthritis experienced changes in their relationship with a health professional when using a wearable during research participation.","output":"Experiences of Wearable Technology by Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis Participating in a Physical Activity Counseling Intervention: Qualitative Study Using a Relational Ethics Lens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short-term observational study of infection control practice was performed in the medical emergency outpatient department (EMOPD) of a tertiary-care hospital in India when threatened by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

This was accomplished by analyzing trends of daily new COVID-19 cases, cumulative confirmed cases, and cases per 100,000 people in different U.S. states, including the District of Columbia. The results indicated a sharp change in trends after face covering mandates. For the 32 states with face covering mandates, 63% and 66% exhibited a downward trend in confirmed cases within 21 and 28 days of implementation, respectively. We estimated that face covering mandates in the 32 states prevented approximately 78,571 and 109,703 cases within 21- and 28-day periods post face covering mandate, respectively. A statistically significant (p = 0.001) negative correlation (-0.54) was observed between the rate of cases and days since the adoption of a face covering mandate. We concluded that the use of face coverings can provide necessary protection if they are properly used.","output":"Effectiveness of Face Coverings in Mitigating the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ecuador is facing the most aggressive outbreak of COVID-19 in Latin America The measures taken to control the infection have helped partially and t","output":"Paradigms About the COVID-19 Pandemic: What Medical Students Know and Feel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During dengue virus (DENV) infection, the virus manipulates different cellular pathways to assure productive replication, including autophagy. However, it remains unclear how this autophagic process is regulated. Here, we have demonstrated a novel role for the microRNA miR-146a in negatively regulating the cellular autophagic pathway in DENV-infected A549 cells and THP-1 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly blocked DENV2-induced autophagy, and LNA-mediated inhibition of miR-146a counteracted these effects. Moreover, co-overexpression of TRAF6, a target of miR-146a, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-146a on autophagy. Notably, treatment with recombinant IFN- fully restored the autophagic activity in TRAF6-silenced cells. Furthermore, our data showed that, in DENV2-infected A549 cells, autophagy promoted a pro-inflammatory response to significantly increase TNF- and IL-6 production. Taken together, our results define a novel role for miR-146a as a negative regulator of DENV-induced autophagy and identify TRAF6 as a key target of this microRNA in modulating the DENV-autophagy interaction.","output":"miR-146a Inhibits dengue-virus-induced autophagy by targeting TRAF6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In some cases it can be fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection, disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing), which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib.

Cardiovascular disease and sexual health share common risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking) and common mediating mechanisms (endothelial dysfunction, subclinical inflammation, and atherosclerosis). This generated a shift of thinking about the pathophysiology and subsequently the management of sexual dysfunction. The introduction of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors revolutionized the management of sexual dysfunction in men. This article will focus on erectile dysfunction and its association with arterial hypertension. This update of the position paper was created by the Working Group on Sexual Dysfunction and Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension. This working group has been very active during the last years in promoting the familiarization of hypertension specialists and related physicians with erectile dysfunction, through numerous lectures in national and international meetings, a position paper, newsletters, guidelines, and a book specifically addressing erectile dysfunction in hypertensive patients. It was noted that erectile dysfunction precedes the development of coronary artery disease. The artery size hypothesis has been proposed as a potential explanation for this observation. This hypothesis seeks to explain the differing manifestation of the same vascular condition, based on the size of the vessels. Clinical presentations of the atherosclerotic and/or endothelium disease in the penile arteries might precede the corresponding manifestations from larger arteries. Treated hypertensive patients are more likely to have sexual dysfunction compared with untreated ones, suggesting a detrimental role of antihypertensive treatment on erectile function. The occurrence of erectile dysfunction seems to be related to undesirable effects of antihypertensive drugs on the penile tissue. Available information points toward divergent effects of antihypertensive drugs on erectile function, with diuretics and beta-blockers possessing the worst profile and angiotensin receptor blockers and nebivolol the best profile.","output":"Update of the position paper on arterial hypertension and erectile dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of schools in addressing rising childhood obesity levels has been acknowledged, and numerous diet- and physical activity-related interventions exist. Aside from formal interventions, opportunistic parent-educator conversations about child weight can arise, particularly in primary school settings, yet little is known about how useful these are. This study aimed to understand the utility of child weight related conversations with parents through exploring educators experiences and perspectives. METHODS: This qualitative study consisted of semi-structured interviews conducted with primary school teaching staff in the United Kingdom (N = 23), recruited through purposive and subsequent snowball sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants identified opportunities and need for child weight discussions in schools. However, conversations were prevented by the indirect and sensitive nature of conversations, and educators professional identity beliefs. Using pre-existing face-to-face opportunities, good parent-teacher relationships and holistic approaches to child health and wellbeing were reported as important in optimising these conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst educator-parent child weight discussions are necessary, discussions are highly challenging, with contradictory views on responsibility sometimes resulting in avoidance. Educators roles should be clarified, and communication training tailored to increase teacher confidence and skills. Current social distancing will likely reduce opportunistic encounters, highlighting a need to further improve communication routes.","output":"Educators experiences and perspectives of child weight discussions with parents in primary school settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The world has been suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic (officially declared by WHO in March 2020), caused by the severe acute respiratory -coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since the last week of December 2019. The disease was initially designated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. In order to protect the health of mass public, an array of research on drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has been conducted globally. However, the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants which evolved in late 2020 and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) which emerged in November 2021 along with its subvariant BA.2 which was first identified in India and South Africa in late December 2021, have raised the doubt about the efficiency of the currently used vaccines especially in terms of the consistent potential to produce neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral spike (S) protein. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: The present review discussed the functional details of major vaccines regarding their efficiency against such variants during the pandemic. Overall, the mRNA vaccines have shown around 94% effectiveness; the adenovector vaccine showed approximately 70% efficacy, whereas Sputnik V vaccines showed around 92% effectiveness; the inactivated whole-virus vaccine CoronaVac/PiCoVacc and BBIBP-CorV showed a varying effectiveness of 65C86% according to the geographic locations; the subunit vaccine NVX-CoV2373 has shown 60C89% effectiveness along with the global regions against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain. However, reduced effectiveness of these vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 variants was noticed which is suggestive for the further administration of booster dose. SHORT CONCLUSION: Maximum variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged during the second wave of COVID-19; and extensive studies on the viral genomic sequences from all geographical locations around the world have been conducted by an array of groups to assess the possible occurrence of mutations(s) specially within the receptor binding domain of the viral spike (S) protein. Mutational similarities and the new or critical mutations within all variants have been clearly identified so far. The study of effectiveness of the currently used vaccines is also ongoing. The persistence of memory B cell action and the other immune components as well as the administration of booster dose is expected to mitigate the disease.","output":"COVID-19 vaccines: their effectiveness against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its emerging variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aerosol route has been a pathway for transmission of many viruses. Similarly, recent evidence has determined aerosol transmission for SARS-CoV-2 to be significant. Consequently, public health officials and professionals have sought data regarding the role of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) features as a means to mitigate transmission of viruses, particularly coronaviruses. Using international standards, a systematic review was conducted to comprehensively identify and synthesize research examining the effect of humidity on transmission of coronaviruses and influenza. The results from 24 relevant studies showed that: increasing from mid (40-60%) to high (>60%) relative humidity (RH) for SARS-CoV-2 was associated with decreased virus survival; although SARS-CoV-2 results appear consistent, coronaviruses do not all behave the same; increasing from low (<40%) to mid RH for influenza was associated with decreased persistence, infectivity, viability, and survival, however effects of increased humidity from mid to high for influenza were not consistent; and medium, temperature, and exposure time were associated with inconsistency in results for both coronaviruses and influenza. Adapting HVAC humidity to mitigate virus transmission is a complex approach due to difficulties of humidity control; humidity is a feature to be considered in conjunction with other HVAC features. Practical ImplicationsWhile increasing relative humidity from mid (40-60%RH) to high (>60%RH) was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 survival, coronaviruses did not all behave the same way. As a result, blanket prescriptive humidity levels for coronavirus mitigation are difficult to ascertain. While influenza survival varied from mid to high RH, increased humidity from low (<40%RH) to mid (40-60%RH) RH was associated with decreased virus survival with maximum survival at low RH. When controlling humidity as an HVAC feature, practitioners should take into account virus type and temperature. Future research should also consider the impact of exposure time, temperature, and medium when designing experiments, while also working towards more standardized testing procedures.","output":"The impact of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) design features on the transmission of viruses, including the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19): a systematic review of humidity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging adults, including post-secondary education students, are disproportionately affected by the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic The speed with which society moved in attempt to minimize the spread of the virus left many students with uncertainty and concern about their health, mental health, and academic futures Considering that post-secondary students are a population at risk, it is important to determine how students respond in the face of the pandemic, and what coping mechanisms or supports will result in improved mental health outcomes This knowledge will be helpful for post-secondary institutions to understand how COVID-19 has influenced the health and well-being of their students, and may facilitate the implementation of strategies to support their students This narrative review explores evidence on how COVID-19 has impacted students with the overall goal to provide a set of recommendations to post-secondary institutions to help meet the evolving needs of this population","output":"The Influence of COVID-19 on Stress, Substance Use, and Mental Health Among Postsecondary Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: With the spread of COVID-19, the Netherlands implemented a policy to keep citizens physically distanced.

Methods: In this analysis, infection reported outcomes with GC drugs reported to FAERS (USA) were extracted and compared to approximately 25'000 drugs in the database. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of infections between budesonide and systemic GC. The data were classified into virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites and non-defined infections. The number of reported sideeffects were ranked from highest to lowest, the 20 most reported viral and bacterial infection were assessed, respectively. All related terms for one species were combined e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus. Results: The database contained 20'363 reports for budesonide, 35'452 for methylprednisolone, 60'516 for prednisolone and 102'982 for prednisone. Of these, a total of 4'465 concerned infection related AEs associated with the budesonide and 93'020 for systemic steroids. Bacteria and virus associated side-effects seemed to be more pronounced with the use of systemic GCs, while for fungal infections the risk was less prominent. Interestingly, budesonide users reported less parasite infections compared to systemically GC treated patients (Fig. 1). The highest number of infections of viruses and bacteria were analysed (generic terms such as Viral infection were excluded).The most frequent reported viral infections were Herpes Viruses followed by Influenza, Hepatitis B Virus and SARS-CoV-2. Budesonide treated individuals have a lower risk for virus infections, except for influenza, Adenovirus and Respiratory Synctial Virus (Fig. 2);there was a reduced risk for all bacterial infections in budesonide treated patients, compared to systemic GC. The most reported bacterial infections were Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, Escheria Coli and Clostridium Difficile (Fig. 3). Conclusion: This unbiased analysis revealed that the use of budesonide was associated with a lower risk of infections of viruses, bacteria and parasites compared to systemic GC.

In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has challenged the entire global health system, since Covid-19 has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as age, genetics, nutritional status, physical status, as well as environmental factors. Despite scientific advances, so far, there is still no specific therapy for the disease. Thus, this study aims to analyze the contribution of physical exercise and maintenance and/or supplementation of vitamin D to the strengthening of the immune system against viral infections, among them, Covid-19. Regular practice of moderate-intensity physical activity is responsible for promoting a reduction in the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF- and IL-1), as well as triggering the increase in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In addition, hypovitaminosis D predisposes to the development of chronic diseases and infections. Therefore, in patients affected by Covid-19, the maintenance of vitamin D levels contributes significantly to the 0prevention of the cytokine storm. Thus, the association between maintaining vitamin D levels and performing moderate-intensity physical exercise is responsible for strengthening the immune system and, therefore, triggering a defense mechanism against infections by intracellular microorganisms, in which SARS -CoV-2.","output":"Influence of exercise and vitamin D on the immune system against Covid-19: an integrative review of current literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the works on the dispersion of droplets and their COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) implications address droplets' dynamics in quiescent environments.

Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\\\\mu m$ radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of $1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets of radius $5\\\\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is seen to be around $2m$.

This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. Conclusion: This study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia.

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.","output":"Genetic grouping of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus sequences using informative subtype markers for pandemic spread visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyze the correlation of gold, exchange rate, and CSPI on COVID-19 pandemic periods by testing the effect of gold exchange prices and exchange rate on CSPI and stock volatility.

CD95, also called Fas, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily. Its ligand, CD95L, was initially detected at the plasma membrane of activated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells where it contributes to the elimination of transformed and infected cells. Given its implication in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance combined with the fact that various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Nonetheless, in different pathophysiological contexts, this receptor is able to transmit non-apoptotic signals and promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although the different non-apoptotic signaling pathways (NF-B, MAPK, and PI3K) triggered by CD95 are known, the initial molecular events leading to these signals, the mechanisms by which the receptor switches from an apoptotic function to an inflammatory role, and, more importantly, the biological functions of these signals remain elusive.","output":"The CD95/CD95L Signaling Pathway: A Role in Carcinogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Pandemie durch SARS-CoV-2 und das dadurch ausgel?ste Krankheitsbild COVID-19 haben Auswirkungen auf alle Bereiche der Medizin.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65  16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","output":"Low-Dose Chest CT for the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted all aspects of liver transplantation.

Increased mortality has not been consistently seen in liver transplant recipients, in whom severe disease is more strongly associated advanced age and medical comorbidities, rather than with transplant-specific factors. While several targeted COVID-19 therapies have reported hepatotoxicity, these therapies may be safe and effective in patients with liver disease and liver transplant recipients.

The retrospective study was performed in 2020 using a self-derived structured questionnaire in a sample of HCWs who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed using a PCR double gene test and consented to be enrolled into the study. The significance level for all statistical tests was set to 0.05. The study showed that of the 4998 hospital workers, among 356 cases reported as COVID-19 infected, 70 consented to take part in the survey: nurses (48.5%), doctors (17.1%), HCWs with patient contact (10.0%), other HCWs without patient contact (7.1%), and cleaning personnel (5.7%). HCWs reported concurrent diseases such as hypertension (17.1%), bronchial asthma (5.7%), and diabetes (5.7%). Failure to keep 2 m distancing during contact (65.5%) and close contact with the infected person 14 days before the onset of symptoms or collection of biological material (58.6%) were identified as the increased risks of infection.

To address this need, we created and evaluated the Michigan system for opioid overdose surveillance (SOS). SOS integrates suspected fatal overdose data from Medical Examiners (MEs), and suspected non-fatal overdoses (proxied by naloxone administration) from the Michigan Emergency Medical Services (EMS) into a web-based dashboard that was developed with stakeholder feedback. Authorised stakeholders can view approximate incident locations and automated spatiotemporal data summaries, while the general public can view county-level summaries. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance system evaluation guidelines, we assessed simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, positive value positive (PVP), representativeness, timeliness and stability of SOS. Data are usually integrated into SOS 1-day postincident, and the interface is updated weekly for debugging and new feature addition, suggesting high timeliness, stability and flexibility. Regarding representativeness, SOS data cover 100% of EMS-based naloxone adminstrations in Michigan, and receives suspected fatal overdoses from MEs covering 79.1% of Michigan's population, but misses those receiving naloxone from non-EMS. PVP of the suspected fatal overdose indicator is nearly 80% across MEs. Because SOS uses pre-existing data, added burden on MEs/EMS is minimal, leading to high acceptability; there are over 300 authorised SOS stakeholders (~6 new registrations/week) as of this writing, suggesting high user acceptability.

Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4/13) and 69.2% (9/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity.

The authors investigate the history of the transformations of higher education since the 1990s which resulted in higher education turning from the sphere of human capital production into an independent branch of the service sector. The article shows that, as a result of the higher education system reforms, changes in university management, the system of labor relations, and the socio-economic status of university teachers are taking place. Various university management models are explored. It is demonstrated that in the modern setting, internal control is replaced by external control, academic freedom is pushed aside by administration, and academic standards are modified and replaced by formal rules. These reforms are accompanied by major changes in labor relations and the role of management and teaching staff in universities. Various examples of the construction of labor relations with teachers adopted in different countries are studied. Close attention is paid to approaches to stimulating teaching activities.

Here, we present an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics while explicitly modeling for the sampling bias involved in testing. Our simulations show that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. We further recommend a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates, calculating the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample size, showing that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.","output":"Incorporating and Addressing Testing Bias Within Estimates of Epidemic Dynamics for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays all news about the new coronavirus disease type arouses interest and concern among specialists around the world Children often are not exposed to the COVID-19 virus or they just have mild course of the disease according to currently available data These data may also explain why children have much lower incidence of COVID-19 in comparison to adults The results of epidemiological observations performed by different researchers groups on the likely protective effect of routine vaccine prevention programs against new type of coronavirus disease led to initiation of clinical studies This article presents the analysis of the vaccinal status and characteristics of vaccination and any other background in 143 Moscow children undergone SARS-CoV-2 infection Overall, the general vaccination background in children who have undergone COVID-19 is characterized with low vaccination level and mismatch with the National Immunization Schedule The most unfavorable vaccination background was mentioned in infants The vaccination rate in all children of the first year of life (in 100% of cases) had gap to the routine schedule The lowest rate of appropriate vaccination was recorded in case of viral poliomyelitis (in 30% of children) in reconvalescents new type of coronavirus disease The vast majority of children undergone COVID-19 were not vaccinated against flue, only a few were vaccinated against pneumococcal infection Now there are several studies focused on determining the protective role of vaccines in relation to the new type of coronavirus disease morbidity and course severity  ֧ԧէߧߧڧ է֧ߧ ߧӧ  ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ߧӧԧ ڧ ӧ٧ӧѧ ҧݧ ڧߧ֧֧  ٧ѧҧ֧ߧߧ ֧ڧѧݧڧ ӧ ӧ֧ ާڧ  ڧާ֧ڧާ  ߧѧ֧ ӧ֧ާ էѧߧߧ, է֧ ѧ ߧ էӧ֧ا֧ߧ ӧ٧է֧ۧӧڧ ӧڧ, ӧ٧ӧѧ֧ԧ COVID-19, ڧݧ ڧާ֧ ݧܧ ݧ֧ԧܧ ֧֧ߧڧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ  էѧߧߧ ѧܧا ާԧ ҧߧڧ, ֧ާ  է֧֧ ԧѧ٧է ҧݧ֧ ߧڧ٧ܧڧ ӧ֧ߧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧ֧ާ COVID-19, ֧  ӧ٧ݧ ݧ֧ߧߧ  է ӧ֧է֧ߧߧ ѧ٧ߧާ ԧѧާ ڧݧ֧էӧѧ֧ݧ֧ ڧէ֧ާڧݧԧڧ֧ܧڧ ߧѧҧݧէ֧ߧڧ ֧٧ݧѧ  ӧ֧ߧ ?٧ѧڧߧ? է֧ۧӧڧ ڧӧڧӧ ڧߧߧ ԧѧާ ӧѧܧڧߧڧݧѧܧڧܧ  ߧ֧ߧڧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ߧӧԧ ڧ ҧӧӧѧݧ ڧߧڧڧѧڧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ  էѧߧߧ ҧݧڧܧѧڧ ֧էѧӧݧ֧ߧ ѧߧѧݧڧ ӧѧܧڧߧѧݧߧԧ ѧ  ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧܧ ڧӧڧӧߧԧ  էԧڧ ӧڧէ ѧߧѧާߧ֧٧  143 ާܧӧܧڧ է֧֧, ֧֧ߧ֧ڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ, ӧ٧ӧѧߧߧ SARS-CoV-2  ֧ݧ ҧڧ ӧѧܧڧߧѧݧߧ ѧߧѧާߧ֧  է֧֧, ֧֧ߧ֧ڧ COVID-19, ѧѧܧ֧ڧ٧֧ ߧڧ٧ܧڧ ӧߧ֧ ڧӧڧ  ߧ֧ӧ֧ӧڧ֧ ѧڧߧѧݧߧާ ܧѧݧ֧ߧէѧ ڧݧѧܧڧ֧ܧڧ ڧӧڧӧ ѧڧҧݧ֧ ߧ֧ҧݧѧԧݧߧ ӧѧܧڧߧѧݧߧ ѧߧѧާߧ֧ ާ֧֧  է֧֧ ѧߧߧ֧ԧ ӧ٧ѧ ӧ֧ߧ ӧѧܧڧߧѧڧ  ӧ֧ է֧֧ ֧ӧԧ ԧէ اڧ٧ߧ ( 100% ݧѧ֧) ݧڧѧݧ ѧӧѧߧڧ֧  ڧߧߧԧ ԧѧڧܧ ѧާ ߧڧ٧ܧڧ ӧ֧ߧ ݧߧ֧ߧߧ ӧѧܧڧߧѧڧ ֧ԧڧڧӧѧݧ  ߧ֧ߧڧ ӧڧߧԧ ݧڧާڧ֧ݧڧ -  30% է֧֧ - ֧ܧߧӧѧݧ֧֧ߧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ߧӧԧ ڧ էѧӧݧ֧ ҧݧڧߧӧ է֧֧, ֧֧ҧݧ֧ӧڧ COVID-19, ߧ ҧݧ ӧѧܧڧߧڧӧѧߧ ڧ ԧڧ, ݧڧ ֧էڧߧڧ ҧݧ ڧӧڧ ڧ ߧ֧ӧާܧܧܧӧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ  ߧѧ֧ ӧ֧ާ ӧէڧ ֧ݧ  ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ, ߧѧѧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ߧ ڧ٧֧ߧڧ ٧ѧڧߧ ݧ ӧѧܧڧ  ߧ֧ߧڧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧ֧ާ  ا֧ݧԧ ֧֧ߧڧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ߧӧԧ ڧ","output":"Analysis of Vaccination Background in Children Undergone SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reasonable equipment layout is essential for creating a healthy and safe environment, especially in a three-level biosafety laboratory with high potential risk factors of infection. Since 2019, COVID-19, an emerging infection has swept the world and caused severe losses. Biosafety laboratories are mandatory sites for detecting high-risk viruses, so related research is urgently needed to prevent further laboratory-acquired infections of operators. This study investigated the effects of obstacles on exposure infection of staff in a biosafety laboratory with related experimental equipment. The numerical simulation results are highly verified by the measured results. The results indicate that although the equipment layout does not affect the bioaerosol removal time, nearly 17% of the pollutant particles in the actual laboratory cannot be discharged effectively compared with the ideal situation. These particles lingered in the lower space under the influence of vortex, which would increase the respiratory risk of operators. In addition, after the experiment a large part of bioaerosol particles would be captured by equipment and floor, and the deposition rate per unit area is 0.45%/m(2) and 0.8%/m(2), respectively. Although the results show that the equipment layout could reduce the pollution on the floor, the disinfection is still an important link, especially on the surfaces of equipment. Meanwhile, the result also indicates that the action should be light and slow when operating in BSL-3 laboratory, so as to avoid the secondary suspension pollution of bioaerosol particles on the equipment surface and floor.","output":"Effect of equipment layout on bioaerosol temporal-spatial distribution and deposition in one BSL-3 laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though not as common as small rodents in laboratory settings, bats are being increasingly used in research studies.

This has impacted food security at the local level, with urban communities not been able to access food as before. In response, newly formed governance mechanisms and policies have emerged on the ground, disrupting existing governance frameworks. This paper examines such developments in London to understand how urban food is governed; and, what has been disruptive and how disruption in access to food has been governed during COVID-19. To do so, it draws on policy analysis, case study research and interview data. The paper finds disconnection between the national and metropolitan level and fragmentation between the metropolitan and municipal of urban food governance; with food security being addressed via people-focused approaches which are generously complemented by third sector and community-led initiatives. It also finds that food disruption in London during COVID-19 is defined by the emergence of novel community-led and place-based organisations and policies, especially at the municipal level, which challenge existing food governance structures C the Hackney Food Network and Food Transition Plans being such examples. These create new spaces of food governance and influence, and change, from the ground up existing governance frameworks.

Little is known about what health care providers and patients think about official surgical site marking policy. METHOD Twenty-one patients and health care providers were interviewed, and the authors conducted field observations of surgeons while they marked their patients. The data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. FINDINGS Surgical site marking was perceived to be a safety precaution for operations involving multiple sides and structures but not for cases where there is no uncertainty about the intended operative site. Participants believed that marking could also facilitate error if the wrong side was marked. Site marking was perceived to have the effect of ensuring that the surgeon meets with the patient prior to the operation on the day of surgery. Concerns were raised with respect to who should mark patients and marking surgical sites for genital surgery or other private body sites. CONCLUSIONS For operations that involve multiple possible surgical sites, site marking should be carried out by individuals who are knowledgeable about the patient and the proposed procedure. For operations in which there is no uncertainty about the intended site, interventions other than site marking could be implemented to ensure patient-surgeon interactions on the day of surgery.

METHODS In the first intervention, a geriatrician provided telephone support, including help with the clinical management of residents, the administration of intravenous and/or hospital-based treatments, provision of oxygen therapy at the facility, blood and diagnostic tests, and the coordination of disinfection by the Military Emergency Unit. In the second intervention, the multidisciplinary care team also performed on-site visits to the nursing homes. RESULTS In the first telephone support intervention 4,553 cases were evaluated. Of these cases, 645 residents (14.2%) were given on-site intravenous therapy;419 cases (9%) were prescribed oxygen therapy, and 573 nasopharyngeal exudate samples were tested (RT-PCR). In the second intervention, 4,965 residents were assessed on-site. Of these, intravenous treatment was prescribed in 316 patients (6.3% of cases) and oxygen therapy in 634 (12.7%). A total of 2.458 RT-PCR tests were performed on residents and workers. There was a decrease in the mortality rate ten days after the implementation of the second intervention. CONCLUSIONS Geriatrician-directed telephone support is a highly efficient and essential approach to coordinate long-distance healthcare delivery at nursing homes, but it doesn't seem to reduce mortality.

Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists. Finally, these new systems can help improve the standards of human life.","output":"Chapter 2 Syndromic surveillance using web data: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Triaging for endoscopy\\" is the process to determine the most deserving patients after careful scrutiny amongst a pool of patients who report for Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy diagnostic or interventional procedures that include Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD), Colonoscopy, ERCP, EUS and Enteroscopy The purpose of triaging at endoscopy is to prevent transmission of SARS-COV2 infection from suspected patient to the health care workers involved at endoscopy The three professional Indian Gastroenterology bodies namely Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of India (SGEI), Indian Society of Gastroenterology (ISG) & Indian Association for the study of the liver (INASL) have recently provided guidance of scheduling of endoscopic procedures in the current Covid-9 pandemic Similar suggestions have been promulgated by other international bodies","output":"Triaging Patients Undergoing Endoscopy during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: DevOps and microservices are acknowledged to be important new paradigms to tackle contemporary software demands and provide capabilities for rapid and reliable software development.

Objectives: This study aims to discover the organization, benefits and issues of software teams using DevOps&microservices from an immersive perspective. Method: An ethnographic study was carried out in three companies with different business, size, products, customers, and degree of globalization. All the three companies claimed their adoption of DevOps and microservices. Seven months (cumulative) of participant observations and nine interviews with practitioners were conducted to collect the data of software teams related to DevOps and microservices. A cross-company empirical investigation using grounded theory was done by analyzing the archive data. Results: The adoption of DevOps and microservices brings benefits to rapid delivery, ability improvements and burden reduction, whilst the high cost and lack of practical guidance were emerged. Moreover, our observations and interviews reflect that in software teams, the relationship between DevOps and microservices is not significant, which differs from the relationship described in the previous studies.

One popular English tweet was liked up to 495,000 times, stressing how popular tweets affected cognitively massive populations. We investigate both text and multimedia in tweets, building a knowledge graph of syntactic/semantic associations in messages including visual features and indicating how online users framed social discourse mostly around the logistics of vaccine distribution. The English semantic frame of\\"vaccine\\"was highly polarised between trust/anticipation (towards the vaccine as a scientific asset saving lives) and anger/sadness (mentioning critical issues with dose administering). Semantic associations with\\"vaccine,\\"\\"hoax\\"and conspiratorial jargon indicated the persistence of conspiracy theories and vaccines in massively read English posts (absent in Italian messages). The image analysis found that popular tweets with images of people wearing face masks used language lacking the trust and joy found in tweets showing people with no masks, indicating a negative affect attributed to face covering in social discourse. A behavioural analysis revealed a tendency for users to share content eliciting joy, sadness and disgust and to like less sad messages, highlighting an interplay between emotions and content diffusion beyond sentiment. With the AstraZeneca vaccine being suspended in mid March 2021,\\"Astrazeneca\\"was associated with trustful language driven by experts, but popular Italian tweets framed\\"vaccine\\"by crucially replacing earlier levels of trust with deep sadness.

Persistent infection is therefore one possible explanation for the cough reflex hypersensitivity and pulmonary inflammation reported in chronic cough patients. METHODS: Bronchoscopic endobronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts were obtained from ten healthy volunteers and twenty treatment resistant chronic cough patients (10 selected for lavage lymphocytosis). A screen for known respiratory pathogens was performed on biopsy tissue. Chronic cough patients also underwent cough reflex sensitivity testing using citric acid. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in incidence of infection between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients (p = 0.115) or non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic groups (p = 0.404). BAL cell percentages were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients without lymphocytosis. Lymphocytic patients however had a significantly raised percentage of lymphocytes (p < 0.01), neutrophils (p < 0.05), eosinophils (p < 0.05) and decreased macrophages (p < 0.001) verses healthy volunteers. There was no significant difference in the cough reflex sensitivity between non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic patients (p = 0.536).

The management of glucose in T1D is challenging, as youth must consider a myriad of factors when making diabetes care decisions. This task often leads to significant hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glucose variability throughout the day, which have been associated with short- and long-term medical complications. At present, most of what is known about each of these complications and the health behaviors that may lead to them have been uncovered in the clinical setting or in laboratory-based research. However, the tools often used in these settings are limited in their ability to capture the dynamic behaviors, feelings, and physiological changes associated with T1D that fluctuate from moment to moment throughout the day. A better understanding of T1D in daily life could potentially aid in the development of interventions to improve diabetes care and mitigate the negative medical consequences associated with it. Therefore, there is a need to measure repeated, real-time, and real-world features of this disease in youth. This approach is known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and it has considerable advantages to in-lab research. Thus, this viewpoint aims to describe EMA tools that have been used to collect data in the daily lives of youth with T1D and discuss studies that explored the nuances of T1D in daily life using these methods.

Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to manage emergencies and cover the costs of the disruption. However, many vascular surgeons are under great financial pressure because of the postponement of all nonemergency procedures. The federal government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some of their expenses and loss of revenue.

Although esophageal manometry is a reliable method to estimate the magnitude of inspiratory effort, procedural issues significantly limit its use in daily clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe the correlation between esophageal pressure swings (P(es)) and nasal (P(nos)) as a potential measure of inspiratory effort in spontaneously breathing patients with de novo ARF. METHODS: From January 1, 2021, to September 1, 2021, 61 consecutive patients with ARF (83.6% related to COVID-19) admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy) and candidate to escalation of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) were enrolled. Clinical features and tidal changes in esophageal and nasal pressure were recorded on admission and 24 h after starting NRS. Correlation between P(es) and P(nos) served as primary outcome. The effect of P(nos) measurements on respiratory rate and P(es) was also assessed. RESULTS: P(es) and P(nos) were strongly correlated at admission (R(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) and 24 h apart (R(2) = 0.94, p < 0.001). The nasal plug insertion and the mouth closure required for P(nos) measurement did not result in significant change of respiratory rate and P(es). The correlation between measures at 24 h remained significant even after splitting the study population according to the type of NRS (high-flow nasal cannulas [R(2) = 0.79, p < 0.001] or non-invasive ventilation [R(2) = 0.95, p < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with ARF, nasal pressure swings did not alter respiratory mechanics in the short term and were highly correlated with esophageal pressure swings during spontaneous tidal breathing. P(nos) might warrant further investigation as a measure of inspiratory effort in patients with ARF. Trial registration: NCT03826797. Registered October 2016.

Recently, the BA.2 sub-lineage has increased in many areas globally. We aimed to assess the severity of BA.2 infections compared to BA.1 in South Africa. We performed data linkages for (i) national COVID-19 case data, (ii) SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data, and (iii) COVID-19 hospitalisations data, nationally. For cases identified using TaqPath COVID-19 PCR, infections were designated as S-gene target failure (SGTF, proxy for BA.1) or S-gene positive (proxy for BA.2). Disease severity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models comparing individuals with S-gene positive infection to SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between 1 December 2021 to 20 January 2022. From week 49 (starting 5 December 2021) through week 4 (ending 29 January 2022), the proportion of S-gene positive infections increased from 3% (931/31,271) to 80% (2,425/3,031). The odds of being admitted to hospital did not differ between individuals with S-gene positive (BA.2 proxy) infection compared to SGTF (BA.1 proxy) infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.09). Among hospitalised individuals, after controlling for factors associated with severe disease, the odds of severe disease did not differ for individuals with S-gene positive infection compared to SGTF infection (aOR 0.91, 95%CI 0.68-1.22).

To this end, the predominant research focus has been on the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 infections stimulated by mRNA and protein vaccines and on the duration and persistence of immune protection. In contrast, the role of the innate immune response to the viral challenge has been underrepresented. This overview focuses on the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on the roles of extracellular proteases in the tissue microenvironment. Proteinase-mediated signaling caused by enzymes in the extracellular microenvironment occurs upstream of the increased production of inflammatory cytokines that mediate COVID-19 pathology. These enzymes include the coagulation cascade, kinin-generating plasma kallikrein, and the complement system, as well as angiotensin-generating proteinases of the reninCangiotensin system. Furthermore, in the context of several articles in this Supplement elucidating and detailing the trajectory of diverse profibrotic pathways, we extrapolate these insights to explore how fibrosis and profibrotic pathways participate importantly in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We propose that the lessons garnered from understanding the roles of microenvironment proteinases in triggering the innate immune response to COVID-19 pathology will identify potential therapeutic targets and inform approaches to the clinical management of COVID-19. Furthermore, the information may also provide a template for understanding the determinants of COVID-19Cinduced tissue fibrosis that may follow resolution of acute infection (so-called long COVID), which represents a major new challenge to our healthcare systems.","output":"The innate immune response, microenvironment proteinases, and the COVID-19 pandemic: pathophysiologic mechanisms and emerging therapeutic targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An 9.4-kDa antifungal peptide designated as campesin was isolated from seeds of the cabbage Brassica campestris.

In Euope and North America, however, their use has been stigmatised for a long time, although this view has radically changed during the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Notwithstanding this, it is still unclear whether face masks worn by COVID-19 carriers may indeed prevent viral transmission and environmental contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Four male patients with COVID-19 were recruited for the study. Two patients wore a surgical mask for 5 h, while two others did not. The spread of the virus in the environment was evaluated through the approved Allplex 2019-nCoV assay. RESULTS: In the room with the two patients without surgical masks, the swab performed on the headboard and sides of the beds was positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In the other room, where two patients were wearing surgical masks, all of the swabs obtained after 5 h tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study add to the growing body of literature supporting the use of face masks as a measure to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by retaining potentially contagious droplets that can infect other people and/or contaminate surfaces. Based on the current evidence, face masks should therefore be considered a useful and low-cost device in addition to social distancing and hand hygiene during the postlockdown phase.","output":"Should face masks be worn to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the postlockdown phase?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Vaccination against COVID-19 is highly recommended to patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the impact of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the immune response following vaccination has been only partially investigated. Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of DMTs on the humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MS patients. Methods: We obtained sera from 912 Sardinian MS patients and 63 healthy controls 30 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 response using anti-Spike (S) protein-based serology. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by anti-Nucleocapsid (N) serology. Patients were either untreated or undergoing treatment with a total of 13 different DMTs. Differences between treatment groups comprised of at least 10 patients were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects model. Demographic and clinical data and smoking status were analyzed as additional factors potentially influencing humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccine. Results: MS patients treated with natalizumab, teriflunomide, azathioprine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and rituximab showed significantly lower humoral responses compared to untreated patients. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in response between patients treated with the other drugs (dimethyl fumarate, interferon, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate) and untreated patients. In addition, older age, male sex and active smoking were significantly associated with lower antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. MS patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher humoral responses to vaccine than uninfected patients. Conclusion: Humoral response to BNT162b2 is significantly influenced by the specific DMTs followed by patients, as well as by other factors such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, and smoking status.

Methods: With the use of a cross-sectional design, the Integrated Health System was used to randomly invite 1000 older adults residing in Qazvin to participate in an online survey. Within the period of November 2020 to January 2021, 696 older Iranian adults (mean age=69.56years; 57.9% women) agreed to participate in the study and reported demographic information as well as measures of religiosity, fear of COVID-19, religious coping, anxiety, and depression. Results: Religiosity had direct effects on depression (B [SE]=-0.087 [0.037]; P=0.023) but not anxiety (B [SE]=-0.063 [0.036]; P=0.072).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytological composition of TW and BAL in health and respiratory disease in dromedary camels. METHODS: TW and BAL samples were collected from dromedary camels and cytological analysis was performed by microscopic examination of prepared smears. Camels with clinical respiratory disease (n = 18) were compared with apparently healthy (control) camels (n = 9). RESULTS: In the apparently healthy camels, differential cytological analysis of TW samples identified macrophages and neutrophils as the main cell populations with lesser proportions of lymphocytes and epithelial cells and very rare abundance of eosinophils and mast cells. In the TW of camels with respiratory disease, neutrophils were the most abundant cells followed by macrophages and lymphocytes. In the BAL of healthy camels, macrophages represented the main cell type followed by lymphocytes and neutrophils. In respiratory-diseased camels, BAL samples contained higher percentages of neutrophils with reduced percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes in comparison to camels from the control group. Collectively, the results of the current study revealed higher abundance of neutrophils in the TW and BAL from dromedary camels than many other veterinary species.

Inorganic nitrate (NO3 - ), through chemical reduction to nitrite and then NO, exerts potent BP-lowering but whether it might be useful in treating undesirable cardiac remodelling is unknown. In a nested age- and sex-matched case-control study of hypertensive patients +/- left ventricular hypertrophy (NCT03088514) we show that lower plasma nitrite concentration and vascular dysfunction accompany cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in patients. In mouse models of cardiac remodelling, we also show that restoration of circulating nitrite levels using dietary nitrate improves endothelial dysfunction through targeting of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)-driven H2 O2 and superoxide, and reduces cardiac fibrosis through NO-mediated block of SMAD-phosphorylation leading to improvements in cardiac structure and function.

Dimerization of this enzyme has been shown to be indispensable for transcleavage activity. However, the auto-processing mechanism of M(pro), i.e. its own release from the polyproteins through autocleavage, remains unclear. This study elucidates the relationship between the N-terminal autocleavage activity and the dimerization of immature M(pro). Three residues (Arg4, Glu290, and Arg298), which contribute to the active dimer conformation of mature M(pro), are selected for mutational analyses. Surprisingly, all three mutants still perform N-terminal autocleavage, while the dimerization of mature protease and transcleavage activity following auto-processing are completely inhibited by the E290R and R298E mutations and partially so by the R4E mutation. Furthermore, the mature E290R mutant can resume N-terminal autocleavage activity when mixed with the immature C145A/E290R double mutant whereas its trans-cleavage activity remains absent. Therefore, the N-terminal auto-processing of M(pro) appears to require only two immature monomers approaching one another to form an intermediate dimer structure and does not strictly depend on the active dimer conformation existing in mature protease. In conclusion, an auto-release model of M(pro) from the polyproteins is proposed, which will help understand the auto-processing mechanism and the difference between the autocleavage and trans-cleavage proteolytic activities of SARS-CoV M(pro).","output":"Liberation of SARS-CoV main protease from the viral polyprotein: N-terminal autocleavage does not depend on the mature dimerization mode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we examine the importance of religion for COVID-19 health promotion.

Second, religion should not be seen as a problem with regards to COVID-19 but as an important part of the worldview and lifestyle of many people. Third, there are valuable health promotion lessons we can learn not only from the intersection of religion and other infectious diseases, but also from approaches taken within science education. Contentious science topics such as evolution and vaccine hesitancy have been effectively communicated to those with a religious faith who are disposed to reject them by reframing and considering religion as a worldview and treating those who do not accept standard scientific theories sensitively. Religion has much to contribute to health promotion, including introducing perspectives on lifes meaning and on death that can differ from those held by many without religious faith.

METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 760 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 29 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Based on the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 score, we divided patients into the normal nutrition group (NRS score <3) and the malnutrition risk group (NRS score 3). The associations of age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, disease severity, activities of daily living (ADL) score, and clinical outcomes with malnutrition risk were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with malnutrition risk. RESULTS: Of patients with COVID-19, 82.6% were at risk of malnutrition.

Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","output":"COVID-19 and Telepsychiatry: Development of Evidence-Based Guidance for Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystemic infection with variables consequences depending on individual and comorbid conditions.

The work may be of interest to the general field of precision medicine beyond the field of neuro-oncology such as in Cancer Neuroscience.","output":"A Preclinical Pipeline for Translational Precision MedicineExperiences from a Transdisciplinary Brain Tumor Stem Cell Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus-like organisms have been previously identified in Arthropod ectoparasites (such as ticks and unfed cat flea). Yet, the question regarding the possible role of these arthropods as SARS-CoV-2 passive/biological transmission vectors is still poorly explored. In this study, we performed in silico structural and binding energy calculations to assess the risks associated with possible ectoparasite transmission. We found sufficient similarity between ectoparasite ACE and human ACE2 protein sequences to build good quality 3D-models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex to assess the impacts of ectoparasite mutations on complex stability. For several species (e.g., water flea, deer tick, body louse), our analyses showed no significant destabilisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex, suggesting these species would bind the viral Spike protein. Our structural analyses also provide structural rationale for interactions between the viral Spike and the ectoparasite ACE proteins. Although we do not have experimental evidence of infection in these ectoparasites, the predicted stability of the complex suggests this is possible, raising concerns of a possible role in passive transmission of the virus to their human hosts.","output":"Arthropod Ectoparasites Have Potential to Bind SARS-CoV-2 via ACE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although concern affects one's welfare or happiness, few studies to date have focused on peoples' concerns during the initial COVID-19 lockdown. The aim of the study was to explore concerns in the Norwegian populations according to gender and age, and identify which concerns were most prominent during the lockdown. A population-based cross-sectional online survey using snowball-sampling strategies was conducted, to which 4527 adults (&#8805;18 years) responded. Questions related to concerns had response alternatives yes or no. In addition, they were asked which concern was most prominent. Nearly all the 4527 respondents (92%) reported that they were concerned: 60.9% were generally concerned about the pandemic, 83.9% were concerned about family and friends, 21.8% had financial concerns, and 25.3% expected financial loss. More women were concerned about family and friends than males, (85.2% vs. 76.2%, p < 0.001), whereas more men expected financial loss (30.4% vs. 24.4%y, p = 0.001). Younger adults (<50 years) had more financial concerns than older adults (25.9% vs. 10.5%, p < 0.001). Being concerned about family and friends was the most prominent concern and was associated with; lower age (OR 0.79), female gender (OR 1.59), and being next of kin (2.42). The most prominent concern for adults 70 years or older was being infected by COVID-19. In conclusion, women and younger individuals were most concerned.

Since the brain as a complex system operates on multitude of scales, the characterization of its dynamics through detection of self-similarity and regularity presents certain challenges. One framework to dig into complex dynamics and structure is to use intricate properties of multifractals. Morphological and functional points of view guide the analysis of the central nervous system (CNS). The former focuses on the fractal and self-similar geometry at various levels of analysis ranging from one single cell to complicated networks of cells. The latter point of view is defined by a hierarchical organization where self-similar elements are embedded within one another. Stroke is a CNS disorder that occurs via a complex network of vessels and arteries. Considering this profound complexity, the principal aim of this study is to develop a complementary methodology to enable the detection of subtle details concerning stroke which may easily be overlooked during the regular treatment procedures. In the proposed method of our study, multifractal regularization method has been employed for singularity analysis to extract the hidden patterns in stroke dataset with two different approaches. As the first approach, decision tree, Na?ve bayes, kNN and MLP algorithms were applied to the stroke dataset. The second approach is made up of two stages: i) multifractal regularization (kulback normalization) method was applied to the stroke dataset and mFr_stroke dataset was generated. ii) the four algorithms stated above were applied to the mFr_stroke dataset. When we compared the experimental results obtained from the stroke dataset and mFr_stroke dataset based on accuracy (specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient), it was revealed that mFr_stroke dataset achieved higher accuracy rates. Our novel proposed approach can serve for the understanding and taking under control the transient features of stroke. Notably, the study has revealed the reliability, applicability and high accuracy via the methods proposed. Thus, the integrated method has revealed the significance of fractal patterns and accurate prediction of diseases in diagnostic and other critical-decision making processes in related fields.","output":"Theory, Analyses and Predictions of Multifractal Formalism and Multifractal Modelling for Stroke Subtypes Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 300,000 reported deaths globally, of which more than 83,000 have been reported in the United States as of May 16, 2020 Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline We suggest that awareness of epidemic severity is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies","output":"Moving Beyond a Peak Mentality: Plateaus, Shoulders, Oscillations and Other 'Anomalous' Behavior-Driven Shapes in COVID-19 Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simultaneous delivery of small molecules and nucleic acids using a single vehicle can lead to novel combination treatments and multifunctional carriers for a variety of diseases.

Whether sHLH may also be observed in patients with a cytokine storm induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still uncertain. We aimed to determine the incidence of sHLH in severe COVID-19 patients and evaluate the underlying risk factors. METHOD: Four hundred fifteen severe COVID-19 adult patients were retrospectively assessed for hemophagocytosis score (HScore). A subset of 7 patients were unable to be conclusively scored due to insufficient patient data. RESULTS: In 408 patients, 41 (10.04%) had an HScore 169 and were characterized as suspected sHLH positive. Compared with patients below a HScore threshold of 98, the suspected sHLH positive group had higher D-dimer, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, triglycerides, ferritin, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, troponin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, while leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelets, lymphocyte, fibrinogen, pre-albumin, albumin levels were significantly lower (all P < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that high ferritin (>1922.58 ng/mL), low platelets (<101  10(9)/L) and high triglycerides (>2.28 mmol/L) were independent risk factors for suspected sHLH in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, COVID-19 patients that were suspected sHLH positive had significantly more multi-organ failure. Additionally, a high HScore (>98) was an independent predictor for mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: HScore should be measured as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients. In particular, it is important that HScore is assessed in patients with high ferritin, triglycerides and low platelets to improve the detection of suspected sHLH.","output":"Risk factors for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in severe coronavirus disease 2019 adult patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a common observation in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) but has not yet been fully described to date.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the levels of depression and mental distress due to COVID-19, and the associations between cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, and depression and mental distress due to COVID-19 among university students in China. METHODS: A large-scale online cross-sectional study (16 cities in 13 provinces) was conducted among university students from February 1 to 10, 2020, in China; 23,863 valid questionnaires were returned. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression. Structural equation modeling was performed to test mediation and suppression effects. RESULTS: Of the 23,863 participants, 47.1% (n=11,235) reported high or very high levels of one or more types of mental distress due to COVID-19; 39.1% (n=9326) showed mild to severe depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 was positively associated with depression. All but one factor (perceived infection risks, perceived chance of controlling the epidemic, staying at home, contacted people from Wuhan, and perceived discrimination) were significantly associated with mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 partially mediated and suppressed the associations between some of the studied factors and depression (effect size of 6.0%-79.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Both mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression were prevalent among university students in China; the former may have increased the prevalence of the latter.

METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional and ecological study used data from the Disease Notification System and the National Registry of Health Establishments of the Ministry of Health, the Income Transfer Registry of the Ministry of Citizenship and the 2010 census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Statistical and spatial analysis of the data was done through percentages of cases and Flow and Kernel map techniques. RESULTS: Seventy-five notified cases of COVID-19 distributed among 7 quilombola communities in the municipality were analyzed. The epidemiological profile followed a national trend, with a higher percentage of cases among persons who were female, adults with low schooling levels, working as family farmers and with an outcome ending in recovery. The spatial distribution of the disease was not homogenous and showed clusters of cases and high incidence rates, especially in communities close to the municipal seat or to highways.

Each type of tumor has its own characteristics, including each individual tumor in each patient. Understanding the complexity of the dynamic interactions that take place between tumor and stromal cells and the microenvironment in tumor progression and metastases, as well as the response of the host and the tumor itself to anticancer therapy, will allow therapeutic actions with long-lasting effects to be implemented using metronomic regimens. This study aims to highlight the complexity of cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment and summarize some of the preclinical and clinical results that explain the multimodality of metronomic therapy, which, together with its low toxicity, supports an inhibitory effect on the primary tumor and metastases. We also highlight the possible use of nano-therapeutic agents as good partners for metronomic chemotherapy. ABSTRACT: The concept of cancer as a systemic disease, and the therapeutic implications of this, has gained special relevance. This concept encompasses the interactions between tumor and stromal cells and their microenvironment in the complex setting of primary tumors and metastases. These factors determine cellular co-evolution in time and space, contribute to tumor progression, and could counteract therapeutic effects. Additionally, cancer therapies can induce cellular and molecular responses in the tumor and host that allow them to escape therapy and promote tumor progression. In this study, we describe the vascular network, tumor-infiltrated immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts as sources of heterogeneity and plasticity in the tumor microenvironment, and their influence on cancer progression. We also discuss tumor and host responses to the chemotherapy regimen, at the maximum tolerated dose, mainly targeting cancer cells, and a multimodal metronomic chemotherapy approach targeting both cancer cells and their microenvironment. In a combination therapy context, metronomic chemotherapy exhibits antimetastatic efficacy with low toxicity but is not exempt from resistance mechanisms. As such, a better understanding of the interactions between the components of the tumor microenvironment could improve the selection of drug combinations and schedules, as well as the use of nano-therapeutic agents against certain malignancies.","output":"Metronomic Anti-Cancer Therapy: A Multimodal Therapy Governed by the Tumor Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for palliative care (PC) has gained increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is highlighted by the adverse outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19 as well as by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care. Patients with cancer constitute a heterogeneous population that exhibits distinct mechanisms of immune dysfunction, associated with distinct systemic features of hot (T-cell-inflamed/infiltrated) and cold (Non-T-cell-inflamed/infiltrated) tumors. The former show hyper immune activated cells and a highly inflammatory environment while, contrastingly, the latter show the profile of a senescent/quiescent immune system. Thus, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of cancers can show distinct trajectories which could lead to a variety of clinical and pathophysiological outcomes. The altered immunological environment including cytokines that characterizes hot and cold tumors will lead to different mechanisms of immune dysfunction, which will result in downstream effects on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: Four hundred and thirty-two participants completed an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale?21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI). Healthcare workers were also asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results: At the DASS-21, 33.3% of the responders presented pathological levels of stress, 25.5% of anxiety, and 35.9% of depression. At the IES-R, 13.9% appeared at risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the PSQI, 57.6% presented sleep disturbances. Female gender and younger age predicted higher scores of distress. Healthcare workers presented higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the general public.

Preterm birth could be one of the risks in pregnant mothers who are infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Preterm births contribute upto 10% of all births and incur significant impact on the child health and cost to the health care system. However, the association of city lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic with the rate of preterm births is unclear. In a cohort study, we examined the association of city lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic with the births at different gestations in three different cities.

After the initial coronavirus surge in New York City, a 68-year-old man developed progressive lower extremity weakness and a defined sensory level at the lower abdomen. He had highly elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies despite an absence of preceding COVID-19 symptoms. Serial electrodiagnostic testing revealed absent lower extremity late responses, with otherwise normal distal sensorimotor conductions. Electromyography revealed active neurogenic changes and reduced motor unit recruitment in the L3-L4 myotomes. Treatment with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin was followed by minimal clinical improvement but re-emergence of the lower extremity late responses on electrodiagnostic testing.

The study seeks to induce policy discussions on effective targeting and the consequential welfare distribution of subsidy interventions in Ghana. Subsidising the price of basic household necessities is expected to immensely benefit the poor whose expenditure is largely occupied by these necessity goods, but, as pertains in developing countries, schemes for effective targeting of the poor are nearly non-existent. This mostly leads to misalignments in income redistribution that is eventually anti-poor. Data from Ghana Living Standard Survey (seventh wave) which captures household final expenditure on goods and services in 2017, including electricity and water, is used for the analysis. First, we simulate household consumption changes as a result of the pandemic on the 2017 data, using on real-time information in the course of the pandemic on household income and expenditure changes. Next, we estimate a complete demand system for all households, and their elasticities of demand for electricity, water and food using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model. Using the computed elasticities, Taylor's approximations are then used to simulate consumer welfare in the form of compensating variation (CV) from price changes due to government subsidies. Our results indicate that the imposed subsidies promote consumer welfare of all households, especially, households living in rural areas. The blanket subsidy on water better identified the poor and the lifeline households than the subsidy on electricity which had a yardstick for targeting. However, we find that the subsidies on the household utilities are regressive in the sense that lifeline consumer households and the poorest households in both urban and rural areas are rather less advantaged in welfare redistribution in both subsidies.","output":"COVID-19 Water and Electricity Subsidies in Ghana: How Do the Poor Benefit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perturbation of the function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress leading to the activation of cell signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) uses ER as a site for synthesis and processing of viral proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that infection with SARS-CoV induces the UPR in cultured cells. A comparison with M, E, and NSP6 proteins indicates that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein sufficiently induces transcriptional activation of several UPR effectors, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), GRP94, and C/EBP homologous protein. A substantial amount of S protein accumulates in the ER. The expression of S protein exerts different effects on the three major signaling pathways of the UPR. Particularly, it induces GRP78/94 through PKR-like ER kinase but has no influence on activating transcription factor 6 or X box-binding protein 1. Taken together, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV S protein specifically modulates the UPR to facilitate viral replication.","output":"Modulation of the unfolded protein response by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The long-term outcome is currently a crucial issue in critical care, and we aim to address the association between culture positivity and long-term mortality in critically ill patients. METHODS: We used the 2015C2019 critical care database at Taichung Veterans General Hospital and Taiwanese nationwide death registration files. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was conducted to determine hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We enrolled 4488 critically ill patients, and the overall mortality was 55.2%. The follow-up duration among survivors was 2.2  1.3 years. We found that 52.6% (2362/4488) of critically ill patients had at least one positive culture during the admission, and the number of patients with positive culture in the blood, respiratory tract and urinary tract were 593, 1831 and 831, respectively.

BACKGROUND: This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of the -coronaviruses wages a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding atypical pneumonia being the primary symptom, the emergence of severe disease mainly resulting from the injury of non-pulmonary organs leaves no alternative, in some cases, other than a dreadful death. METHODS: To provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint representing the prognostic values of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed with the calculation of mean difference and 95% con?dence intervals of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Bili), and albumin (Alb) in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: While severe COVID-19 cases displayed higher values of ALT, AST, and Bili compared to non-severe patients (mean differences of 7.48, 12.07, and 3.07, respectively), the value of Alb was significantly lower in severe cases (mean differences of -6.15). There was also a correlation between alterations in all of the parameters; however, only correlations between ALT and Bili (R=0.98, p=0.0031), and Bili and Alb (R=-1, p=0.0012) were significant.

In response to the pandemic, there has been a transition in medical education practice from traditional forms of teaching to online instruction delivery and virtual learning. Effective clinical microbiology education involves a combination of 'hands-on' practical learning and instructional delivery of scientific knowledge. Microbiology practical laboratories are critical learning environments offering 'hands-on' learning experiences that cannot be replicated through online learning. We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand the perception of online and face-to-face microbiology laboratory sessions among the medical students and microbiology faculty at Arabian Gulf University (AGU). METHODS: The study participants were third and fourth-year undergraduate medical students and faculty involved in delivering microbiology labs at AGU. The questionnaire consisted of questions ranging from perceived learning style to attitude towards online delivery of microbiology curriculum. After the questionnaire administration (google form), focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted for students and microbiology faculty separately. RESULTS: Among 168 students, 50.6% preferred face-to-face lab sessions as compared to 30.4% who preferred online labs, and 51.8% considered online labs to be an essential addition to face-to-face labs. Among the faculty, 85.7% preferred the face-to-face mode of teaching. All the faculty (100%) disagreed that all the microbiology labs teaching should be online. 57.2% considered online labs to be an essential addition to traditional face-to-face labs. Both faculty and students hold that a blended mode of instructional delivery is vital and indispensable for the transfer of skills and knowledge for microbiology students. CONCLUSION: The blended mode of delivering microbiology laboratory sessions in medical school is successful and well-received by both students and faculty. Students take the responsibility for furthering their own learning and understanding of concepts. Instructors have also noticed that blending learning strategies also successfully enhances the development of cognitive skills and problem-solving abilities in students. A review of the microbiology lab curriculum is necessary to identify content areas that can be delivered effectively through online, face-to-face lab sessions, or both, supported with appropriate tools and infrastructure.

Protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection, like social distancing or isolation, are being taken too late and COVID-19 symptoms are non-specific and can resemble those from rhinoviral infection or influenza, causing a rush of anxious patients with (mild) symptoms to the hospitals. Furthermore, COVID-19 diagnosis is made by taking swabs from the upper of lower respiratory tract, which is not only an unpleasant experience for the patient, but is also time-consuming. Therefore, a fast differential diagnosis between SARS-COV-2, influenza or rhinovirus infection would allow to optimize the hospital management and hospitalize those patients with proven COVID-19 disease, where other patients can easily recover at home. Breath analysis could therefore be explored investigating both volatile organic compounds (VOC) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and aerosols (EBA) in a non-invasive manner, without discomforting the patient. However, breath research is highly affected since human-mediated transmission of viral particles through breath is of high concern. Nevertheless, breathomics can provide fast results and the sampling materials can be cleaned and autoclaved thoroughly, minimizing the risk for cross-contamination. Breath analysis also allows the breath sample to be taken by the patient himself, hence, considering the social distancing measures and protecting health care workers. In this article, we summarize 3 pathways in which SARS-CoV-2 could generate specific VOCs.

Varietal development, soil and water management, and adoption of resource conservation technologies in rice cultivation are the key interventions areas to address these challenges. The cultivation of lesser water requiring crops, replacing rice in light-textured soil and rainfed condition, should be encouraged through policy interventions. Direct seeding of short duration, high-yielding and stress tolerant rice varieties with water conservation technologies can be a successful approach to improve the input use efficiency in rice cultivation under mediumCheavy-textured soils.

It was designed to capture standardised clinical data on community COVID-19 cases. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting to a multimedia screening platform between 13 April and 13 May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days with phone calls every 2 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered additional SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to establish their infection status. We describe the clinical, virological and natural history features of this prospective population-based cohort. FINDINGS: Of 2073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95% CI 25.9 to 30.3) were positive; 604/1136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.9), anosmia (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4) and ageusia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.8) were most strongly associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR or serology. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia and closer to symptom onset. The rates of hospitalisation and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalised group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presents in a similar way to other mild community-acquired respiratory diseases, but the presence of fever, anosmia and ageusia can assist the specific diagnosis.

METHODS From Jul 2018 to Dec 2019, pediatric patients who presented with left main coronary arterial atresia and subsequently underwent surgical coronary ostioplasty were recruited into this retrospective study. Concomitant mitral repair was applied when the regurgitation was moderate or more. RESULTS A total of 9 patients diagnosed as left coronary arterial atresia were included. Mitral regurgitation was found in all of them, including 6 (66.7%) severe and 1 (11.1%) moderate and 2 (22.2%) mild. In addition to ischemic lesions which was found in 7 (77.8%) patients, structural mitral problem was also common (presented in 7 (77.8%) patients). All the patients underwent coronary ostioplasty with autologous pulmonary arterial patch augmenting anterior wall of the neo-ostium. Mean Aortic cross clamp time and CPB time was 88.1  18.9 and 124.6  23.6 min, respectively. During a median of 10.9 (range, 3.3 - 17.2) months follow-up, there was only 1 death at 5 months after surgery. All survivors were recovered uneventfully with normal left ventricular function, however, with 4 (50.0%) significant recurrence of MR. CONCLUSIONS With favorable surgical outcomes, coronary ostioplasty for LMCA atresia may be an option of revascularization.

Although lipids have been shown to possess antiviral efficacy, little is currently known about lipid compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry properties. To address this issue, we screened, overall, 17 polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids, as wells as lipid-soluble vitamins. In performing target-based ligand screening utilizing the RBD-SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we observed that polyunsaturated fatty acids most effectively interfere with binding to hACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using a spike protein pseudo-virus, we also found that linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, eicosapentaenoic acid showed higher efficacy than linolenic acid in reducing activity of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases, but neither of the fatty acids affected their expression at the protein level. Also, neither reduction of hACE2 activity nor binding to the hACE2 receptor upon treatment with these two fatty acids was observed. Although further in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings, our study provides a new insight into the role of lipids as antiviral compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 strain.","output":"Polyunsaturated -3 fatty acids inhibit ACE2-controlled SARS-CoV-2 binding and cellular entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Wearables, as small portable computer systems worn on the body, can track user fitness and health data, which can be used to customize health insurance contributions individually. In particular, insured individuals with a healthy lifestyle can receive a reduction of their contributions to be paid. However, this potential is hardly used in practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify which barrier factors impede the usage of wearables for assessing individual risk scores for health insurances, despite its technological feasibility, and to rank these barriers according to their relevance. METHODS: To reach these goals, we conduct a ranking-type Delphi study with the following three stages. First, we collected possible barrier factors from a panel of 16 experts and consolidated them to a list of 11 barrier categories. Second, the panel was asked to rank them regarding their relevance. Third, to enhance the panel consensus, the ranking was revealed to the experts, who were then asked to re-rank the barriers. RESULTS: The results suggest that regulation is the most important barrier. Other relevant barriers are false or inaccurate measurements and application errors caused by the users. Additionally, insurers could lack the required technological competence to use the wearable data appropriately. CONCLUSION: A wider use of wearables and health apps could be achieved through regulatory modifications, especially regarding privacy issues. Even after assuring stricter regulations, users privacy concerns could partly remain, if the data exchange between wearables manufacturers, health app providers, and health insurers does not become more transparent.","output":"Adopting wearables to customize health insurance contributions: a ranking-type Delphi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of study: As women with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress and social isolation, which may be further exacerbated by current COVID-19 physical distancing precautions, we examined the feasibility and acceptability of a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention for this understudied patient population Methods: Women with a recent diagnosis (3 months) of non based telehealth psychosocial intervention for this understudied patient population Methods: Women with a recent diagnosis (3 months) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) currently undergoing treatment completed baseline measures of computer literacy and were randomized to a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention consisting of ether coping skills or attention control (AC) psychoeducation Both arms consisted of five, 60 min telehealth (video conference over Zoom) sessions Groups were comprised of 3-5 members and led by a masters-level clinician Participants completed one \\"practice run\\" with technology prior to starting the group session After the final session, patients rated overall experience of intervention delivery and telehealth platform Results: Seventy patients (mean age= 66 yrs, 54% &gt;65 yrs;71% non-Hispanic White;50% college educated;75% advanced stage) consented (63% consent rate) and 65 were randomized to intervention or AC At baseline, 47% of patients indicated daily computer use while 50% said they rarely or never use a computer Attendance was high in both arms with 63% of patients attending all sessions (means: intervention = 3 18;AC = 3 56) Across arms, 89% preferred group delivery and 92% preferred online delivery The majority used a smartphone or tablet to participate (72%) Regarding the Zoom platform, 71% said it was easy to use, 65% would recommend it to others, and 41% felt comfortable with it after one use Only 44% thought that telehealth was the same as it would have been in-person Conclusions: The present findings suggest the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a group-based psychosocial intervention via telehealth for middle to older aged women with NSCLC undergoing treatment, which may be particularly beneficial to address isolation during the current season of physical distancing","output":"Feasibility of a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention for women with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the similarities and differences between myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation is an essential step for a proper patients' management in current practice. Both syndromes are caused by a critical stenosis or a total occlusion of coronary arteries (mostly due to thrombosis on atherosclerotic plaque), and manifest with a similar clinical presentation. Recent epidemiologic studies show that the relative incidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) moves in an opposite fashion (decreasing and increasing respectively), with a prognosis that is worse at short-term follow-up for STEMI but comparable at long-term. Current management differs, as for STEMIs an immediate reperfusion is recommended, while for NSTEMIs risk stratification is mandatory in order to stratify patients' risk, and then decide the timing for coronary angiography. Periprocedural and technical aspects of the interventional management as well antithrombotic medications are for the most similarly implemented in the two types of MI, with routine radial access, DES implant, and novel P2Y12 inhibitors representing the standard of care in both cases. The following review article aims to compare the two types of MI, with and without persistent ST-segment elevation. The main purpose is to explore their similarities and differences and address areas of uncertainty with regards to clinical presentation, therapeutic management, and prognosis. The identification of high-risk NSTEMI patients is important as they may require an individualised approach that can substantially overlap with current STEMI recommendations and their mortality remains high if their management is delayed.","output":"Myocardial Infarction with and without ST-segment Elevation: a Contemporary Reappraisal of Similarities and Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in various regions of the world during the Covid19 pandemic is of the utmost importance to help mitigate the effects of this devastating disease.

Our RT-qPCR screening and phylogenomics directed a sequence/structure analysis of the Spike glycoprotein, revealing mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico, in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C/S:452R (B.1.427/9). Overall, the detected variants in Mexico show mutations in the N-terminal domain (i.e., R190M), in the receptor-binding motif (i.e., T478K, E484K), within the S1-S2 subdomains (i.e., P681R/H, T732A), and at the basis of the protein, V1176F, raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the postulated variants of interest (VOIs) 20B/478K.V1 and P.3. Moreover, the population patterns of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers sampled with a self-sampling scheme, revealed a bimodal distribution of polymorphisms in all three sampled localities from central Mexico, and confirmed the presence of several fixed variants, mostly from the 241T-3037T-14408T-23403G haplotype common in Asia.

We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW, we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting Lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The described activities were developed at the Museum by a specially established Expert Team. RESULTS: Groups of employees and places in which they were most exposed to contact with visitors and, as a consequence, at the highest risk of getting infected, were characterised. The employees were provided with personal protective equipment, and at the Museum site, devices essential for maintaining the microbiological cleanliness of the rooms, were placed. In the next stage, instructions and procedures for particular groups of employees were prepared. Visitors were educated about the need of taking precautions and were allowed to disinfect in several places at the Memorial Site. Steps to reduce attendance at this time has also been taken. Procedures for employees of the A-BSM were developed in such way that they can also be used after reopening of the Museum for visitors. CONCLUSIONS: The actions which ensured the microbiological safety of the A-BSM employees, brought satisfying results.

This analysis includes our first 100 patients with complete data who had confirmed COVID-19 and were supported with ECMO. The first patient in the cohort was placed on ECMO on March 17, 2020. Differences by the mortality group were assessed using &#967;2 tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests and Welch's analysis of variance for continuous variables. The median time on ECMO was 12.0 days (IQR = 8-22 days). All 100 patients have since been separated from ECMO: 50 patients survived and 50 patients died. The rate of survival with veno-venous ECMO was 49 of 96 patients (51%), whereas that with veno-arterial ECMO was 1 of 4 patients (25%). Of 50 survivors, 49 have been discharged from the hospital and 1 remains hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors were generally younger, with a lower median age (47 versus 56.5 years, p = 0.014). In the 50 surviving patients, adjunctive therapies while on ECMO included intravenous steroids (26), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (26), convalescent plasma (22), remdesivir (21), hydroxychloroquine (20), and prostaglandin (15).

Methods: : We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to four hospitals in Wuhan, China from December 2019 to February 2020. Mortality at the of end of follow up period was the primary outcome. Prognostic factors for mortality were also assessed and a prognostic model was developed, calibrated and validated. Results: : The study included 492 patients with SARS-CoV-2, which were divided into three cohorts, the training cohort (n=237), the validation cohort 1 (n=120), and the validation cohort 2 (n=135). Multivariate analysis showed that five clinical parameters were predictive of mortality at the end of follow up period, including age, odds ratio (OR), 1.1 / years increase (p<0.001);neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio OR, 1.14 (p<0.001), body temperature on admission OR, 1.53 / C increase (p=0.005), increase of aspartate transaminase OR, 2.47 (p=0.019), and decrease of total protein OR, 1.69 (p=0.018).Furthermore, the prognostic model drawn from the training cohort was validated with the validation cohort 1 and 2 with comparable area under curve (AUC) at 0.912, 0.928, and 0.883, respectively.

Polices of interest include test-trace-isolate, travel restriction, compulsory face mask and hygiene practices, social distancing, dexamethasone/remdesivir therapy and vaccination. The latest phase 3 trial results and the WHO Target Product Profiles for COVID-19 vaccines will be used to model vaccine characteristics. A cost (expected resource utilisation and productivity losses) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be attached to these outputs for a cost-utility analysis. The primary outcome measure will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generated from the incremental cost of policy alternatives expressed as a ratio of the incremental benefits (QALYs gained).

Removal of HS from the surface of swine kidney cells (SK6) by heparinase I treatment almost completely abolished infection of these cells with virus that was extensively passaged in swine kidney cells before it was cloned (clone C1.1.1). Infection with C1.1.1 was inhibited completely by heparin (a GAG chemically related to HS but sulfated to a higher extent) and by dextran sulfate (an artificial highly sulfated polysaccharide), whereas HS and CS-A, -B, and -C were unable to inhibit infection. Bound C1.1.1 virus particles were released from the cell surface by treatment with heparin. Furthermore, C1.1.1 virus particles and CSFV E(rns) purified from insect cells bound to immobilized heparin, whereas purified CSFV E2 did not. These results indicate that initial binding of this virus clone is accomplished by the interaction of E(rns) with cell surface HS. In contrast, infection of SK6 cells with virus clones isolated from the blood of an infected pig and minimally passaged in SK6 cells was not affected by heparinase I treatment of cells and the addition of heparin to the medium. However, after one additional round of amplification in SK6 cells, infection with these virus clones was affected by heparinase I treatment and heparin. Sequence analysis of the E(rns) genes of these virus clones before and after amplification in SK6 cells showed that passage in SK6 cells resulted in a change of an Ser residue to an Arg residue in the C terminus of E(rns) (amino acid 476 in the polyprotein of CSFV). Replacement of the E(rns) gene of an infectious DNA copy of C1.1.1 with the E(rns) genes of these virus variants proved that acquisition of this Arg was sufficient to alter an HS-independent virus to a virus that uses HS as an E(rns) receptor.","output":"Passage of classical swine fever virus in cultured swine kidney cells selects virus variants that bind to heparan sulfate due to a single amino acid change in envelope protein E(rns)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host innate defence against influenza virus infection is an intricate system with a plethora of antiviral factors involved.

Conversely, the expression of the critical innate antiviral response genes interferon alpha/beta, CD80, CXCL10 and IL15 was significantly downregulated in KO mouse lungs compared to WT mouse lungs. These data are consistent with the known function of HDAC6 of de-acetylating the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and activating the host innate antiviral response cascade.

We use real-time data on the spread of Covid-19, governmental lockdown policies, and battle events to study the causal short-term effect of the pandemic on armed conflict. Our results suggest that both the spread of Covid-19 and lockdown policies exhibit a global Null effect with considerable regional heterogeneity.

The rate of rapid dissemination, magnitude of viral contagiousness, person to person transmission at an asymptomatic phase of illness pose a unique and dangerous challenge for all patients, including neonatal and obstetric patients. Although scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, nature of transmission, and efficacy of mitigation strategies is growing, neither a cure or vaccine have been developed. While COVID-19 is primarily a disease of older patients, infection is now seen across all age demographics with reports of illness in pregnant patients and infants. Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2. Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial. Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection. The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.","output":"The changing landscape of SARS-CoV-2: Implications for the maternal-infant dyad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is an emerging disease in pigs that causes massive economic losses in the swine industry, with high mortality in suckling piglets. Early identification of PED virus (PEDV)-infected herd through surveillance or monitoring strategies is necessary for mass control of PED. However, a common working diagnosis system involves identifying PEDV-infected animals individually, which is a costly and time-consuming approach. Given the above information, the thrusts of this study were to develop a real-time fluorescent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RtF-RT-LAMP) assay and establish a pooled testing system using faecal sample to identify PEDV-infected herd. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an accurate, rapid, cost-effective, and simple RtF- RT-LAMP assay for detecting the PEDV genome targeting M gene. The pooled testing system using the RtF-RT-LAMP assay was optimized such that a pool of at least 15 individual faecal samples could be analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The developed RtF-RT-LAMP assay in our study could support the design and implementation of large-scaled epidemiological surveys as well as active surveillance and monitoring programs for effective control of PED.

However, because it is a predictive methodology, GS strongly depends on statistical and machine learning to perform these predictions. For continuous outcomes, more models are available for GS. Unfortunately, for count data outcomes, there are few efficient statistical machine learning models for large datasets or for datasets with fewer observations than independent variables. For this reason, in this paper, we applied the univariate version of the Poisson deep neural network (PDNN) proposed earlier for genomic predictions of count data. The model was implemented with (a) the negative log-likelihood of Poisson distribution as the loss function, (b) the rectified linear activation unit as the activation function in hidden layers, and (c) the exponential activation function in the output layer. The advantage of the PDNN model is that it captures complex patterns in the data by implementing many nonlinear transformations in the hidden layers. Moreover, since it was implemented in Tensorflow as the back-end, and in Keras as the front-end, the model can be applied to moderate and large datasets, which is a significant advantage over previous GS models for count data. The PDNN model was compared with deep learning models with continuous outcomes, conventional generalized Poisson regression models, and conventional Bayesian regression methods. We found that the PDNN model outperformed the Bayesian regression and generalized Poisson regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy, although it was not better than the conventional deep neural network with continuous outcomes.","output":"Application of a Poisson deep neural network model for the prediction of count data in genome-based prediction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Foam rolling is a type of self-massage using tools such as foam or roller sticks. However, to date, there is no consensus on contraindications and cautions of foam rolling. A methodological approach to narrow that research gap is to obtain reliable opinions of expert groups. The aim of the study was to develop experts consensus on contraindications and cautions of foam rolling by means of a Delphi process. Methods: An international three-round Delphi study was conducted. Academic experts, defined as having (co-) authored at least one PubMed-listed paper on foam rolling, were invited to participate. Rounds 1 and 2 involved generation and rating of a list of possible contraindications and cautions of foam rolling. In round 3, participants indicated their agreement on contraindications and cautions for a final set of conditions. Consensus was evaluated using a priori defined criteria. Consensus on contraindications and cautions was considered as reached if more than 70% of participating experts labeled the respective item as contraindication and contraindication or caution, respectively, in round 3. Results: In the final Delphi process round, responses were received from 37 participants. Panel participants were predominantly sports scientists (n = 21), physiotherapists (n = 6), and medical professionals (n = 5). Consensus on contraindications was reached for open wounds (73% agreement) and bone fractures (84%). Consensus on cautions was achieved for local tissue inflammation (97%), deep vein thrombosis (97%), osteomyelitis (94%), and myositis ossificans (92%). The highest impact/severity of an adverse event caused by contraindication/cautions was estimated for bone fractures, deep vein thrombosis, and osteomyelitis. Discussion: The mechanical forces applied through foam rolling can be considered as potential threats leading to adverse events in the context of the identified contraindications and cautions.

One of the issues that growing societies are presently facing is the care of elderly individuals. The dearth of skilled workers in the senior healthcare setting has been exacerbated by the worldwide shift of aging populations. There might be an enhanced need for old nursing since the global older demographic is expected to nearly triple in the coming three decades. There are advancements in computer technologies for supporting the aged plus associated caregivers, checking their wellbeing, and offering company to them. Given the global elderly demographic development possibilities, it is no coincidence that the aided care market is drawing fast advancement, rendering health management for nurses a breeze. While the world's governments manage the aging population next years, these ideas will become extremely vital. They will almost certainly encounter economic and political demands to modify state medical care management, retirement benefits, and social security in order to meet the needs of an aging population. Considering that the demand for physicians is growing, a necessity has developed to deliver individualized care for the aged as well as to respond appropriately in emergencies. As a result, in the technological society, healthcare is exploring artificial intelligence to deliver personalized treatment to individuals in need.

Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R)(4) (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequence-specific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R)(4)CPMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. StructureCactivity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.","output":"Delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by (R-X-R)(4) peptides: structureCactivity studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Breast ultrasound (BUS) is often performed as an adjunct to mammography in breast cancer screening or for evaluating breast lesions.

Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3-3.8 g), E (17.0 mg), C (137.2-269.8 mg), A (1273.3 g), B-12 (1.5-2.0 g), and folate (455.1-561.3 g), the minerals Se (120.0 g), Zn (11.0 mg), Fe (15.0-18.8 mg), and Mn (5.2-12.5 mg), and polyphenols (1171.00 mg) needed to maintain an active immune response.

The chemical composition of propolis is multifarious, as it depends on the botanical sources from which honeybees collect resins and exudates. Nevertheless, despite this variability propolis may have a general pharmacological value, and this review systematically compiles, for the first time, the existing preclinical and clinical evidence of propolis activities as an antiviral and immunomodulatory agent, focusing on the possible application in respiratory diseases. In vitro and in vivo assays have demonstrated propolis broad-spectrum effects on viral infectivity and replication, as well as the modulatory actions on cytokine production and immune cell activation as part of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical trials confirmed propolis undeniable potential as an effective therapeutic agent; however, the lack of rigorous randomized clinical trials in the context of respiratory diseases is tangible. Since propolis is available as a dietary supplement, possible use for the prevention of respiratory diseases and their deleterious inflammatory drawbacks on the respiratory tract in humans is considered and discussed. This review opens up new perspectives on the clinical investigation of neglected propolis biological properties which, now more than ever, are particularly relevant with respect to the recent outbreaks of pandemic respiratory infections.","output":"The antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of propolis: An update and future perspectives for respiratory diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a major public health emergency in the world. Nurses as key members of the COVID-19 patient care team are exposed to most challenges caused by the disease. As exploring the experiences of nurses as patient supporters and caregivers can play an important role in improving the quality of care for patients with COVID-19 disease, the present study explored the experiences of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative design. This study employed purposive sampling to select 10 nurses with bachelors and masters degrees in nursing who were taking care of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs or inpatient wards in southern Iran. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The collected data were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis procedure proposed by Graneheim and Lundman. RESULTS: The analysis of the data revealed four main themes and ten sub-themes: A) physical, psychological, and social burden of care (excessive workload; fear, anxiety, worry; unpleasant social experiences; compassion fatigue) B) unmet needs (personal needs and professional needs) C) positive experiences (pleasant social experiences and inner satisfaction), and D) strategies (problem-solving strategies and stress symptom mitigation strategies). CONCLUSIONS: An analysis of the themes and subthemes extracted in this study suggested that the nurses who participated in this study faced many personal and professional challenges. Therefore, health officials and specialists need to pay special attention to nurses challenges and needs.","output":"Exploring the experiences of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19: a qualitative study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the dual behavior of consistent mask wearing and vaccine acceptance represents an effective method of protecting oneself and others from COVID-19, research has yet to directly examine its predictors. A total of 3347 responses from a pooled cross-sectional survey of adults living in Saskatchewan, Canada, were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model. The outcome variable was the combined behavior of mask-wearing and vaccine intention in four combinations, while covariates consisted of socio-demographic factors, risk of exposure to coronavirus, mitigating behaviors, and perceptions of COVID-19. Those who were 65 years and older, financially secure, consistently practiced social distancing and had no or very few contacts with people outside their households, were concerned about spreading the virus, and perceived they would be seriously sick if infected were likely to engage in both mask wearing and vaccine acceptance, rather than one or the other, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.24 to 27.54. Further, within mask wearers, these factors were associated in a graded manner with vaccine intent. By describing the characteristics of those who engage in both mask wearing and vaccine acceptance, these results offer a specific set of characteristics for public health authorities to target and, therefore, contribute to the rapidly evolving body of knowledge on protective factors for COVID-19.","output":"Characteristics Associated with the Dual Behavior of Mask Wearing and Vaccine Acceptance: A Pooled Cross-Sectional Study among Adults in Saskatchewan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the training surgical residents and faculty receive on opioid prescribing, and to identify opportunities for curricula development to fill training gaps. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews and surveys. After applying an overarching organizational framework, we used an iterative, team-based process to develop relevant inductive codes. We then performed thematic analyses to identify and catalogue critical domains related to surgeons' education about opioid prescribing. SETTING: Tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Maximum variation purposive sampling was used to recruit general surgery residents and surgical faculty members. RESULTS: We interviewed 21 attending surgeons and 20 surgical residents. Surgeons reported minimal formal training on pain management and prescribing opioids. A minority of individuals described receiving opioid training in the form of continuing medical education, intern boot camp sessions, and medical school classes. Participants compensated for the lack of formal training during residency by informally learning from senior residents, consulting pain specialists, and seeking external learning resources. Increased surgical experience was correlated with increased comfort with pain management. A majority of surgeons desired formal training. The most commonly requested educational resources were opioid prescribing guidelines for common operations and recommendations for treating chronic pain patients. Residents requested that training occur early in residency to maximize the benefits received. Based on these findings, we developed a conceptual framework to explain how surgeons learn to prescribe opioids and to highlight opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgeons routinely prescribe opioids and desire education on opioids, a majority of them do not receive any training. Instituting formal educational programs is critical for improving opioid prescribing practices among surgeons.These programs should include standard prescribing guidelines and address management of acute postoperative pain in patients with chronic pain.","output":"\\"It's Like Learning by the Seat of Your Pants\\": Surgeons Lack Formal Training in Opioid Prescribing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced numerous safety concerns for sleep medicine patients and health-care workers, especially related to the use of aerosol-generating positive airway pressure devices. Differences between physician and sleep technologist concerns with regard to viral exposure and mitigation strategies may inform protocols to ensure safety and promote patient and health-care worker resilience and retention. METHODS An anonymous online survey aimed at sleep medicine practitioners was active from April 29, 2020 to May 8, 2020. RESULTS We obtained 379 responses, including from 75 physicians and 283 technologists. The proportion of all the respondents who were extremely/very concerned about the following: exposing patients (70.8%), exposing technologists (81.7%), and droplet (82.7%) and airborne (81.6%) transmission from CPAP. The proportion of respondents who felt that aerosol precautions were extremely/very important varied by scenario: always needed (45.6%); only with CPAP (25.9%); and needed, despite negative viral testing (67.0%). More technologists versus physicians rated the following as extremely/very important: testing parents for COVID-19 (71.2 vs 47.5%; P = .01), high-efficiency particulate air filters (75.1 vs 61.8%; P = .02), and extremely/very concerned about shared-ventilation systems (65.9 vs 51.5%; shared ventilation P = .041). The respondents in northeastern and western United States were more concerned about the availability of COVID-19 testing than were those in other regions of the United States. Among the total number of respondents, 68.0% expected a  50% drop in patients willing to have in-laboratory testing, with greatest drops anticipated in northeastern United States. CONCLUSIONS Sleep health-care workers reported high levels of concern about exposure to COVID-19.

Thus, this study aimed to understand the current healthcare workforce quality and future expectations from the attitudes and perceptions of health leaders. Methods: A qualitative research was carried out using semi-structured interviews consisting of 24 different questions. Participants of the study were healthcare leaders from different backgrounds and governmental institutions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using thematic analysis via the N-Vivo program. Results: Eleven participants were involved in the study, with one female and ten males. A thematic analysis and N-Vivo program yielded 5 main themes: (1) workforce competency, (2) health transformation, (3) leadership, (4) workforce planning, and (5) healthcare quality, with 22 emerging sub-themes. Moreover, participants responded with different attitudes and perceptions. Conclusion: Health leaders are satisfied with the current direction of workforce competency and planning, yet fragmentation of the system and poor accessibility may need further enhancement. Furthermore, misutilization of services and the uncertainty of the future and talent pool are potential barriers for capability building. Moreover, with the existing gap in the workforce, health leaders believe that privatization and corporatization may have a positive effect. Aside from that, Saudization with the current plan of having a minimum standard of accepting non-Saudis in certain areas might benefit in maintaining competition and enriching experience.

Although macrophages are not the primary target cells of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, viral RNA and antigens in activated monocytes and macrophages have been detected in post-mortem samples, and dysfunctional monocytes and macrophages have been hypothesized to contribute to a protracted hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we demonstrate that CD169, a myeloid cell specific I-type lectin, facilitated ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry in macrophages. CD169- mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in macrophages resulted in expression of viral genomic and sub-genomic (sg) RNAs with minimal viral protein expression and no infectious viral particle release, suggesting a post-entry restriction of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Intriguingly this post-entry replication block was alleviated by exogenous ACE2 expression in macrophages. Restricted expression of viral gRNA and sgRNA in CD169+ macrophages elicited a pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF, IL-6 and IL-1{beta}) in a RIG-I, MDA-5 and MAVS-dependent manner, which was suppressed by remdesivir pre- treatment. These findings suggest that de novo expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in macrophages contributes to the pro-inflammatory cytokine signature and that blocking CD169-mediated ACE2 independent infection and subsequent activation of macrophages by viral RNA might alleviate COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response. Author SummaryOver-exuberant production of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by macrophages has been hypothesized to contribute to severity of COVID-19 disease. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to macrophage-intrinsic immune activation during SARS- CoV-2 infection are not fully understood. Here we show that CD169, a macrophage- specific sialic-acid binding lectin, facilitates abortive SARS-CoV-2 infection of macrophages that results in innate immune sensing of viral replication intermediates and production of proinflammatory responses. We identify an ACE2-independent, CD169- mediated endosomal viral entry mechanism that results in cytoplasmic delivery of viral capsids and initiation of virus replication, but absence of infectious viral production. Restricted viral replication in CD169+ macrophages and detection of viral genomic and sub-genomic RNAs by cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptor family members, RIG-I and MDA5, and initiation of downstream signaling via the adaptor protein MAVS, was required for innate immune activation. These studies uncover mechanisms important for initiation of innate immune sensing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macrophages, persistent activation of which might contribute to severe COVID-19 pathophysiology.","output":"CD169-mediated restrictive SARS-CoV-2 infection of macrophages induces pro-inflammatory responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die knstliche Intelligenz birgt gro?e Potenziale fr innovative Produkte, mehr Verbraucherfreundlichkeit und einen h?heren Lebensstandard.

Methods.- This single-center, historical cohort study was performed in Baharloo hospital as a referral hospital for COVID-19 patients in Tehran. Patients were divided into two groups; 163 statins users and 547 non-users. Mortality rate, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospitalization were compared between studied groups. In addition, during the investigation, pre-existing conditions were evaluated for groups. If a significant difference was observed between groups, the feature was considered in the adjustment of the odds ratio. Results.- At the beginning, statistical analysis study showed that statins users had significantly (p <0.0001) higher mortality rate, ICU admission and length of hospitalization. But after implementation of variables such as age, sex, diabetes, hypertension status, stroke, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), corticosteroids, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for adjustment of the odds ratio, a considerable alteration appeared in the studied values.

Endogenous biomolecule zinc plays a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

Co-application of zinc dose-dependently potentiated both peak amplitude and the sustained component of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 currents; pretreatment with zinc between 3 to 100 M exerted the same potentiation as co-application. However, pretreatment with zinc induced a significant inhibition of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels when zinc concentrations were over 250 M. The potentiation of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc was pH dependent, as zinc shifted the pH dependence of ASIC1a/3 currents from a pH50 of 6.54 to 6.77; whereas the inhibition of ASIC1a/3 currents by zinc was also pH dependent. Furthermore, we systematically mutated histidine residues in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a or ASIC3 and found that histidine residues 72 and 73 in both ASIC1a and ASIC3, and histidine residue 83 in the ASIC3 were responsible for bidirectional effects on heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc.

Survival analysis of DTYMK based on TCGA-LIHC and ICGC-LIRI-JP cohorts was conducted. We found that DTYMK was dramatically upregulated in tumor tissue compared with that in adjacent liver tissue. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high expression of DTYMK in HCC patients' tumor tissue was significantly corresponded to worse overall survival (OS) (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that overexpressing DTYMK led to poor relapse free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, DTYMK is upregulated in tumors and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In our report, DTYMK is higher expression in HCC cancer tissue and cell line than tumor adjacent tissue and normal liver cell line.

Yet most traditional doctoral programs are not structured to support successful interdisciplinary research. Here we describe the design of and students experiences in the COMBINE (Computation and Mathematics for Biological Networks) interdisciplinary graduate program at the University of Maryland. COMBINE focuses on the development and application of network science methods to biological systems for students from three primary domains: life sciences, computational/engineering sciences, and mathematical/physical sciences. The program integrates three established models (T-shaped, pi-shaped and shield-shaped) for interdisciplinary training. The program components largely fall into three categories: (1) core coursework that provides content expertise, communication, and technical skills, (2) discipline-bridging elective courses in the two COMBINE domains that complement the students home domain, (3) broadening activities such as workshops, symposiums, and formal peer-mentoring groups. Beyond these components, the program builds community through both formal and informal networking and social events. In addition to the interactions with other program participants, students engage with faculty in several ways beyond the conventional adviser framework, such as the requirement to select a second out-of-field advisor, listening to guest speakers, and networking with faculty through workshops. We collected data through post-program surveys, interviews and focus groups with students, alumni and faculty advisors. Overall, COMBINE students and alumni reported feeling that the program components supported their growth in the three program objectives of Network Science & Interdisciplinarity, Communication, and Career Preparation, but also recommended ways to improve the program. The value of the program can be seen not only through the student reports, but also through the students research products in network science which include multiple publications and presentations.

Therefore, this study attempted to assess public perceptions about the industry in Malaysia among the public, including teenagers, based on 3,010 reliably answered questionnaire-surveys. Generally, the public perceived the wood products industry to be a low-wage economy, labor-intensive, predominated by foreign contract workers, and unsustainable in the long-term. In essence, the public appear to have stronger negative images of the industry compared to the positive images. The main drivers for such negative perceptions, identified through the factor analysis, were the prevailing business environment in the industry and its workforce characteristics. Consequently, teenagers and school-leavers tend to be less interested in pursuing a career in the industry, let alone pursuing further studies in the wood-related fields. The main reasons cited for this were the limited career growth opportunity due to the predomination of family-controlled small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the industry and the discouragements from family members and friends. The provision of reliable, timely, and transparent information is important to boost the publics awareness and build positive beliefs and perception of the wood industry.","output":"Public perception of the wood products industry in Malaysia and its implication on the future workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Implementation of GDMT for HFrEF remains low We assessed the feasibility of a virtual GDMT Team for optimization of GDMT during hospitalization for non-CV conditions Hypothesis: A GDMT Team will improve GDMT optimization compared with usual care Methods: Consecutive hospitalized patients with HFrEF40% were prospectively identified Patients with critical illness, cardiology consult, de-novo HF, COVID-19 & SBP 90mmHg were excluded February 3 to March 1, 2020 served as a pre-intervention period during which patients were screened, but did not receive GDMT Team interventions From March 2 to June 21, 2020, a pharmacist-physician team provided up to 1 suggestion daily for GDMT optimization (evidence-based ?-blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, & MRA) to treating teams based on an evidence-based algorithm The primary outcome of a composite GDMT optimization score, the net of positive therapeutic changes (+1 for new initiations/uptitrations) & negative therapeutic changes (-1 for discontinuations/downtitrations) during hospitalization, was compared between the pre- vs post-intervention periods Multivariable linear regression models were built adjusting associations for clinical factors Safety outcomes requiring intervention or GDMT downtitration were identified Results: Of 187 encounters, 84 (45%) met eligibility criteria: 28 pre-intervention, 56 post-intervention Mean age was 6811 yrs, 70% men, and 61% White Of 88 GDMT Team suggestions, 49 (56%) were followed by discharge During the intervention, cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations rose from 0 to 11085 in MA Mean GDMT optimization score was -0 14 (95% CI: -0 58 to +0 30) pre-intervention & +0 64 (95% CI: +0 35 to +0 93) post-intervention (P=0 004) In a model inclusive of demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, potassium levels, eGFR, & LVEF, the intervention was the only factor associated with higher GDMT optimization score ( coeff 0 89;P=0 008) Safety events included 1 instance each of AKI, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, & hypotension Conclusion: Admission for non-CV conditions is a feasible setting for GDMT optimization A virtual GDMT Team was associated with improved GDMT;this implementation strategy warrants testing in a prospective RCT","output":"Feasibility of Virtual Optimization of Guideline Directed Medical Therapy in Hospitalized Patients with HFrEF During the Covid-19 Pandemic: The IMPLEMENT-HF Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiota, the brain, and neurologic-associated affections.

Despite its demonstrated prevalence and high case fatality rate, antibiotics remain the only target-oriented treatment option currently available. Starting from results showing that low-dose anthracyclines protect against sepsis in mice, we sought to find new causative treatment options to improve sepsis outcomes. METHODS: Sepsis was induced in mice, and different treatment options were evaluated regarding cytokine and biomarker expression, lung epithelial cell permeability, autophagy induction, and survival benefit. Results were validated in cell culture experiments and correlated with patient samples. FINDINGS: Effective low-dose epirubicin treatment resulted in substantial downregulation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) degrading enzyme S1P lyase (SPL). Consequent accumulation and secretion of S1P in lung parenchyma cells stimulated the S1P-receptor type 3 (S1PR3) and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK, reducing tissue damage via increased disease tolerance. The protective effects of SPL inhibition were absent in S1PR3 deficient mice. Sepsis patients showed increased expression of SPL, stable expression of S1PR3, and increased levels of mucin-1 and surfactant protein D as indicators of lung damage. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights a tissue-protective effect of SPL inhibition in sepsis due to activation of the S1P/S1PR3 axis and implies that SPL inhibitors and S1PR3 agonists might be potential therapeutics to protect against sepsis by increasing disease tolerance against infections.

In this study, we have made efforts to identify molecules that can potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has a large flexible binding pocket that can accommodate various chemically diverse ligands but a complete occupation of the binding cavity is necessary for efficient inhibition and stability. We augmented glide three-tier molecular docking protocol with water thermodynamics to screen molecules obtained from three different compound libraries. The diverse hits obtained through docking studies were scored against generated WaterMap to enrich the quality of results. Five molecules were selected from each compound library on the basis of scores and protein-ligand complementarity. Further MD simulations on the proposed molecules affirm the stability of these molecules in the complex.

In the current study FISH has been performed to locate 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the chromosomes of nine Lathyrus species belong to five different sections, all have chromosome number 2n=14, Lathyrus gorgoni Parl, Lathyrus hirsutus L., Lathyrus amphicarpos L., Lathyrus odoratus L., Lathyrus sphaericus Retz, Lathyrus incospicuus L, Lathyrus paranensis Burkart, Lathyrus nissolia L., and Lathyrus articulates L. RESULTS The revealed loci of 45S and 5S rDNA by FISH on metaphase chromosomes of the examined species were as follow: all of the studied species have one 45S rDNA locus and one 5S rDNA locus except L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L. and L. sphaericus Retz L. have two loci of 5S rDNA. Three out of the nine examined species have the loci of 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the opposite arms of the same chromosome (L. nissolia L., L. amphicarpos L., and L. incospicuus L.), while L. hirsutus L. has both loci on the same chromosome arm. The other five species showed the loci of the two types of rDNA on different chromosomes. CONCLUSION The detected 5S and 45S rDNA loci in Lathyrus could be used as chromosomal markers to discriminate the chromosome pairs of the examined species.

However, little is known about the perspectives of key stakeholders in mental healthcare, whose support will be critical for its successful implementation into routine clinical practise. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of staff working in the private mental health sector around the use of therapeutic VR, including potential implementation barriers and facilitators. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with cross-disciplinary clinicians (n = 14) and service managers (n = 5), aged 28C70 years working in a major private mental health hospital in Victoria, Australia. Transcripts were analysed using general inductive coding to allow themes to naturally emerge. Results: Three major themes were identified: clinical factors (four subthemes), organisational factors (five subthemes), and professional factors (three subthemes). The themes encompassed enabling factors and potential barriers that need to be addressed for successful implementation of VR. Clinical factors highlighted the influence of knowledge or perceptions about appropriate clinical applications, therapeutic efficacy, safety and ethical concerns, and patient engagement. Organisational factors emphasised the importance of service contexts, including having a strong business case, stakeholder planning, recruitment of local opinion leaders to champion change, and an understanding of resourcing challenges. Professional factors highlighted the need for education and training for staff, and the influence of staff attitudes towards technology and perceived usability of VR. Conclusions: In addition to enabling factors, potential implementation barriers of therapeutic VR were identified, including resourcing constraints, safety and ethical concerns, negative staff attitudes towards technology and VR system limitations. Future dissemination should focus on addressing knowledge and skills gaps and attitudinal barriers through development of clinical guidelines, training programs, and implementation resources (e.g., adoption decision tools, consultation opportunities).","output":"Implementation of Therapeutic Virtual Reality Into Psychiatric Care: Clinicians' and Service Managers' Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine had been very slowly making inroads into standard clinical practice.

The high vaccine coverage is crucial for controlling disease transmission, however, the vaccine hesitancy might be a barrier to the establishment of sufficient herd immunization. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among different population groups, and explore common barriers and facilitators to vaccination decisions. METHODS: The current survey was performed among Chinese students, public health professionals, medical workers and general population from January to March 2021 from seven cities in China. The questionnaire contained sociodemographic information, concerns about infection with COVID-19, general vaccination behaviors and attitudes, the General Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, the COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and other potential factors. Univariate analysis was conducted by chi-squared test, and variables significant at P < 0.10 were then included in a multivariable regression model. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 15.6% in our study, and 23.9% of students, 21.2% of the general population, 13.1% of medical workers, and 10.4% of public health professionals had vaccine hesitancy. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that participants who had received negative information of COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 1.563, 95% CI: 1.229C1.986) and who had doubts about the information source (OR: 2.157, 95% CI: 1.697C2.742) were more likely to have vaccine hesitancy. While those who needed transparent information about COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.722, 95% CI: 0.535C0.973) and who would get COVID-19 vaccine if doctors recommended (OR: 0.176, 95% CI: 0.132C0.234) were less likely to have COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given recommendations from medical workers about vaccination can motivate people to accept COVID-19 vaccination, appropriate training in knowledge about vaccines and communication skills are necessary for them to increase publics willingness of vaccination. Reducing the spread of misinformation and disseminating facts in a timely and accurate way will likely reduce vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, to establish suitable communication strategies and information exchange platforms between the government and the public and a warning system on infodemic would be helpful to improve publics confidence in vaccination.

and chronic bowel conditions. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are responsible for maintaining homeostatic interactions between the gut microbiota and its host. In this study, we hypothesized that disruption to colonic IECs is a key factor underlying stress-induced disturbances to intestinal homeostasis. Conventionally raised (CONV-R) and germ-free (GF) mice were exposed to a social disruption stressor (Str) to ascertain how stress modifies colonic IECs, the mucosal layer, and the gut microbiota. RNA sequencing of IECs isolated from CONV-R mice revealed a robust pro-inflammatory (Saa1, Il18), pro-oxidative (Duox2, Nos2), and antimicrobial (Reg3b/g) transcriptional profile as a result of Str. This response occurred concomitant to mucus layer thinning and signs of microbial translocation. In contrast to their CONV-R counterparts, IECs from GF mice or mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics exhibited no detectable transcriptional changes in response to Str. Nevertheless, IECs from Str-exposed GF mice exhibited an altered response to ex vivo bacterial challenge (increased dual Oxidase-2 [Duox2] and nitric oxide synthase-2 (Nos2)), indicating that STR primes host IEC pro-oxidative responses. In CONV-R mice stress-induced increases in colonic Duox2 and Nos2 (ROS generating enzymes) strongly paralleled changes to microbiome composition and function, evidencing Str-mediated ROS production as a primary factor mediating gut-microbiota dysbiosis. In conclusion, a mouse model of social stress disrupts colonic epithelial and mucosal integrity, a response dependent on an intact microbiota and host stress signals. Together these preclinical findings may provide new insight into mechanisms of stress-associated bowel pathologies in humans.","output":"Psychological stress disrupts intestinal epithelial cell function and mucosal integrity through microbe and host-directed processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Identify, summarise and present key recommendations published in the literature to prevent skin damage in health professionals as a result of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the covid-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets.

Additionally, they can also enhance other optical signals, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, making them suitable for biosensor development. In this review, we provide a detailed discussion of the currently developed biosensors based on the aforementioned unique optical features of GNPs. Mainly, we focus on four different plasmonic biosensing methods, including localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), fluorescence enhancement, and quenching caused by plasmon and colorimetry changes based on the coupling of GNPs.

The aim of this article was to analyze the antibody responses after a full series of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplantation and dialysis patients and to define the factors that alter seroconversion status in these populations. In this systematic review, 18 studies investigating the antibody response to full vaccination with two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant patients were included. Kidney transplant and dialysis patients have a lower seroconversion rate after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than the healthy population: 27.2% for kidney transplantation, 88.5% for dialysis patients while all healthy control in these studies seroconverted. Moreover, anti-S antibody titers were lower in seroconverted kidney transplantation or dialysis patients than in healthy control in all studies that assessed this variable. Older age and dialysis vintage, immunosuppressive or chemotherapy treatment, and lower serum albumin, white blood cell, lymphocyte and hemoglobin counts were associated with lower/no antibody response to vaccination.

METHODS: We applied Hills Criteria, counterfactual reasoning, and causal diagrams to evaluate a potentially causal relationship between an exposure and outcome in three published observational studies: a) one burden of disease cohort study to determine the association between type 2 diabetes and herpes zoster, b) one post-authorization safety cohort study to assess the effect of AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine on the risk of autoimmune diseases, and c) one matched case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccine in preventing hospitalization for rotavirus gastroenteritis. RESULTS: Among the 9 Hills criteria, 8 (Strength, Consistency, Specificity, Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence, Analogy, Experiment) were considered as met for study c, 3 (Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence) for study a, and 2 (Temporary, Plausibility) for study b. For counterfactual reasoning criteria, exchangeability, the most critical assumption, could not be tested. Using these tools, we concluded that causality was very unlikely in study b, unlikely in study a, and very likely in study c. Directed acyclic graphs provided complementary visual structures that identified confounding bias and helped determine the most accurate design and analysis to assess causality.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary counseling on weight management and metabolic abnormalities in children with obesity. One hundred and sixty-five patients aged 2C18 years old were studied over a two and a half year period. Data collected included demographic information, anthropometric assessment, laboratory measurements, and self-reported eating behaviors. Dietary counseling was provided at each visit. The data was analyzed from the first and last visits and the subjects were retrospectively divided into responders and non-responders based on a decrease in their BMI. After receiving dietary guidance, BMI decreased in 44% of the children, and these participants were classified as responders (BMI-R; n = 72). However, BMI did not improve in 56% of the participants, and these were classified as non-responders (BMI-NR; n = 93). At the initial visit, anthropometric measurements and dietary habits were similar between the groups. At the time of the last visit, mean change in BMI was ?1.47 (SD 1.31) for BMI-R and +2.40 (SD 9.79) for BMI-NR. Analysis of food intake revealed that BMI-R significantly improved their dietary habits (p = 0.002) by reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (p = 0.019), processed foods (p = 0.002), sweets (p < 0.001), and unhealthy snacks (p = 0.009), as compared with BMI-NR.

With qualitative and interpretive analysis, it is revealed that leaners positively receive online teacher feedback for its detrimentalness together with a growth mindset and high levels of resilience, but, on the whole, there is a metacognitive deficit: they misinterpret self-consciousness about online feedback which is underpinned by a conception of tasks that characterizes online L2 learning. This research expands our understanding of L2 learning processes pertaining to awareness and management of teacher feedback receiving and may also shed light on solutions to empower livestream teaching by building external scaffolding devices to compensate weaknesses of online L2 education during the pandemic and beyond.","output":"Understanding Learners Metacognition of Online Teacher Feedback Amid COVID-19: A Case Study in a University Livestream Instruction Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims/Objectives/Background Patients admitted to hospital via the emergency department (ED) need to be separated by SARS-CoV-2 infection status to prevent transmission. Using clinical criteria alone is not feasible due to the range of symptoms and asymptomatic spread. Turnaround time of laboratory PCR assays (~6-24 hrs) hinders patient movement through the hospital with pressure on side-rooms pending results and exposure risk if unsuspected cases are moved into bays. Lateral flow devices (LFD) can provide a rapid diagnosis and aid patient movement. This implementation study aimed to assess the accuracy and safety of LFDs within an ED during a highprevalence period. Methods/Design Two rapid point-of-care tests (POCT) were introduced during December 2020: Cobas?-Liat? system (Roche Diagnostics) is a 20-minute assay comparable to laboratory PCR (in-house validation), and LFDs. Symptomatic patients with a positive LFD were cohorted on a 'red' ward. Asymptomatic patients with a negative result were allocated an 'amber' ward, pending lab PCR. Where there were discrepancies between results and symptoms;a Liat? was performed. The LFDs were validated by PCR swabs to determine true positive and false negative (FN) rates and to minimise fallout via contact tracing. The PCR cycle threshold (CT) values were recorded to evaluate the LFD sensitivity and specificity. Results were collected between December 2020-March 2021. Results/Conclusions Comparing LFD with PCR results, the sensitivity and specificity were 70.7% and 99.1%. LFD FNs had higher CT values (25), indicating the beginning or end of infection - unlikely infectious. One period of false positives during lower prevalence revealed a faulty batch. During the study period 90% of patients left the ED with a virological diagnosis. We conclude that POCT can aid the diagnosis of COVID- 19 in the ED when combined with existing laboratory-based PCR algorithms. We demonstrate a safe and effective use of POCT in the ED which could be replicated across other centres.","output":"Real-world deployment of point-of-care SARSCoV-2 testing in the emergency department admission pathway can support the safe, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Initiation of Molecular Pathology FCPS in Pakistan Is Urgent!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracking the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge for policy makers.

The objective of this article is to establish general recommendations for surgical teams to manage the kidney transplant program duringthe COVID-19 era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document is based on the scientific evidence available on the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the experience of authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web and Pubmed search was performed using the keywords \\"SARS-CoV-2\\",\\" COVID-19\\", \\"COVID Urology\\", \\"COVID-19 surgery\\", and \\"kidney transplantation.\\" A modified nominal group technique was used. RESULTS: When health system saturation occurs, kidney transplants should be deferred, except in patients with low transplant possibilities and an optimal kidney available, combined transplants or life-threatening situations. Screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be done in all those donors and recipients with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who have visited or live inhigh-risk areas, or who have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Donation and transplantation will not proceed in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Surgeries should be based on general recommendations in the COVID-19 era and will be efficient, short, and focused on those with the shortest hospital stay. In emergencies, protective measures will be taken with persona lprotection equipment. Surgical staff will be only the strictly necessary, and permanence in the OR should be minimized. Transplant urology consultations will be conducted by teleconsultation when possible. CONCLUSION: The safety of potential donors and recipients must be guaranteed, adopting individual protection measures and screening for SARS-CoV-2.

This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient's plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients. Among a uniformly moderate cohort of patients who received tocilizumab, only 10 metabolites were different among individuals with a favorable evolution as compared to those who required transfer into the intensive care unit. The elevation of one single metabolite, anthranilic acid, had a poor prognostic value, correlating with the maintenance of high interleukin-10 and -18 levels. Given that products of the kynurenine pathway including anthranilic acid have immunosuppressive properties, we speculate on the therapeutic utility to inhibit the rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase.","output":"Metabolomic analyses of COVID-19 patients unravel stage-dependent and prognostic biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic surveillance is a fundamental part of public health practice.

It is proposed for high-risk carcinomas for which an improvement in progression-free survival though not overall survival has been shown. However, despite the development of radiotherapy treatments with intensity modulation and image guidance, adjuvant radiation therapy remains toxic to the digestive system. We aimed to investigate the incidence of digestive toxicity and the presence of any predictive factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for endometrial carcinoma at the Institut de cancrologie de Lorraine and centre hospitalier mile-Durkheim between January 2010 and October 2016 and analyzed to identify factors associated with chronic digestive toxicity. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients received a total dose of 50Gy fractionated into 25 sessions, five per week for five weeks. The median follow-up after irradiation completion was 38 months. The incidence of gastrointestinal and rectal toxicity in all patients treated with pelvic irradiation for endometrial carcinoma was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.4-19%) for grade 3-4 and 25.6% (95%CI: 17.0-34.9%) for grade 2-4. No factor was found to be significantly predictive of chronic digestive toxicity. At five years, the overall survival was 74.3%, (95%CI: 65.3-81.4%), progression-free survival was 69.6% (95%CI: 60.1-77.3%) and incidence of pelvic recurrence was 7.9% (95%CI: 3.8-13.9%).

The purpose of this study was to explore the management effectiveness of Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) based on PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle management and to further develop the medical student management system during the pandemic. METHODS: The methods of document review, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used to continuously improve the management measures for postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the PDCA cycle. RESULTS: Investigations were conducted on the management system, back-to-school arrangements, laboratory management, COVID-19 prevention and control training, online teaching, mentoring, dissertation progress, and emotional state of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that strengthening public health management knowledge training, increasing infectious-disease-related knowledge training, innovating online teaching methods, improving PDCA management model maps, and formulating improvement programmes are conducive to improving the quality of such management.

Reliable figures of this reduction have not been produced yet. Our international audit aimed at giving a precise snapshot of the absolute and relative changes of emergency surgical admissions at the outbreak of the pandemic. Materials and methodsDatasets of patients admitted as general surgical emergencies into 45 internationally distributed emergency surgical units during the months of March and April 2020 (Covid-19 pandemic outbreak) were collected and compared with those of patients admitted into the same units during the months of March and April 2019 (pre-Covid-19). Primary endpoint was to evaluate the relative variation of the presentation symptoms and discharge diagnoses between the two study periods. Secondary endpoint was to identify the possible change of therapeutic strategy during the same two periods. ResultsForty-four centres participated sent their anonymised data to the study hub, for a total of 6263 patients. Of these, 3810 were admitted in the pre-Covid period and 2453 in the Covid period, for a 35.6% absolute reduction. The most common presentation was abdominal pain, whose incidence did not change between the two periods, but in the Covid period patients presented less frequently with anal pain, hernias, anaemia and weight loss. ASA 1 and low frailty patients were admitted less frequently, while ASA>1 and frail patients showed a relative increase. The type of surgical access did not change significantly, but lap-to-open conversion rate halved between the two study periods. Discharge diagnoses of appendicitis and diverticulitis reduced significantly, while bowel ischaemia and perianal ailments had a significant relative increase.ConclusionsOur audit demonstrates a significant overall reduction of emergency surgery admissions at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic with a minimal change of the proportions of single presentations, diagnoses and treatments.

The objective of this study was to investigate how these factors were affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and impacted metabolic control in children with T1D. MATERIALS AND METHOD: One hundred children with T1D were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measurements, snack and meal frequency, carbohydrate consumption, HbA1c levels, and exercise patterns were recorded and compared before and after the lockdown. Subjects were divided into two subgroupspatients with decreased and patients with increased HbA1c levels after the lockdownand comparisons of the same parameters were also made between these two subgroups. RESULTS: In the overall group, the mean HbA1c level was significantly higher after the lockdown compared to before (p = 0.035). Meal schedules changed due to delayed sleep and waking times, and total daily carbohydrate consumption increased in the subgroup with increased HbA1c while it decreased in the subgroup with decreased HbA1c (p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that blood sugar management in children with T1D worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is not possible to explain this with any one factor, some behavioral changes observed in our study, such as inactivity, irregular meal frequency and timing, and irregular sleep and waking patterns appeared to be associated with blood sugar management.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We review the current approaches and their feasibility to treat dystonic anterocollis by injecting longus colli muscle (LCo) with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) as well as present our personal experiences in this field compared with the findings from previously published studies.

The polypeptides can be coupled with corresponding vectors to stimulate the immune system to produce corresponding antibodies, which is also a simple and effective vaccine development method. The discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: The analyses were related to epitopes on 3 proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, which are located on the lipid envelope of the SARS-CoV-2. Based on the NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2, the conformational and linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods. Furthermore, the conservation of the epitopes, the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed, the sequences of the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the GISAID. RESULTS: 7 epitopes were predicted, including 6 linear epitopes and 1 conformational epitope. One of the linear and one of the conformational consist of identical sequence, but represent different forms of epitopes. It is worth mentioning that all 6 identified epitopes were conserved in nearly 3500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, showing that it is helpful to obtain stable and long-acting epitopes under the condition of high frequency of amino acid mutation, which deserved further study at the experiment level.

Numerous studies have shown that mutagen-resistant RNA virus variants display amino acid mutations in the RdRp and other replicase subunits, which in turn exhibit an altered fidelity phenotype affecting viral fitness, adaptability, and pathogenicity. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), like its close relative West Nile virus (WNV), is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. Here, we describe the successful generation of multiple ribavirin-resistant populations containing a shared amino acid mutation in the SLEV RdRp (E416K). These E416K mutants also displayed resistance to the antiviral T-1106, an RNA mutagen similar to ribavirin. Structural modeling of the E416K polymerase mutation indicate its location in the pinky finger domain of the RdRp, distant from the active site. Deep-sequencing of the E416K mutant revealed lower genetic diversity than wildtype SLEV after growth in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Phenotypic characterization showed E416K mutants displayed similar or increased replication in mammalian cells, as well as modest attenuation in mosquito cells, consistent with previous work with WNV high-fidelity variants. In addition, attenuation was limited to mosquito cells with a functional RNA interference (RNAi) response, suggesting an impaired capacity to escape RNAi could contribute to attenuation of high-fidelity variants. Our results provide increased evidence that RNA mutagen resistance arises through modulation of the RdRp and gives further insight into the consequences of altered fidelity of flaviviruses.","output":"Mutagen resistance and mutation restriction of St. Louis encephalitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4; 204 amino acids) is the chymotrypsin-like serine main proteinase of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (order Nidovirales), which controls the maturation of the replicase complex. nsp4 includes a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) connected to the catalytic two-beta-barrel structure by the poorly conserved residues 155 and 156. This dipeptide might be part of a hinge region (HR) that facilitates interdomain movements and thereby regulates (in time and space) autoprocessing of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at eight sites that are conserved in arteriviruses. To test this hypothesis, we characterized nsp4 proteinase mutants carrying either point mutations in the putative HR domain or a large deletion in the CTD. When tested in a reverse genetics system, three groups of mutants were recognized (wild-type-like, debilitated, and dead), which was in line with the expected impact of mutations on HR flexibility. When tested in a transient expression system, the effects of the mutations on the production and turnover of replicase proteins varied widely. They were cleavage product specific and revealed a pronounced modulating effect of moieties derived from the nsp1-3 region of pp1a. Mutations that were lethal affected the efficiency of polyprotein autoprocessing most strongly. These mutants may be impaired in the accumulation of nsp5-7 and/or suffer from delayed or otherwise perturbed processing at the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 junctions. On average, the production of nsp7-8 seems to be the most resistant to debilitating nsp4 mutations.

To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity.

We aimed at implementing a novel multidimensional HCP-centric evidence-based, dynamic policy with the objectives to reduce risk of HCP infection, ensure welfare and safety of the HCP and to improve willingness to accept and return to duty. SETTING: Our tertiary care university hospital, with 12 600 HCP, was divided into high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk zones. In the high-risk and medium-risk zones, we organised training, logistic support, postduty HCP welfare and collected feedback, and sent them home after they tested negative for COVID-19. We supervised use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and kept communication paperless. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited willing low-risk HCP, aged <50 years, with no comorbidities to work in COVID-19 zones. Social distancing, hand hygiene and universal masking were advocated in the low-risk zone. RESULTS: Between 31 March and 20 July 2020, we clinically screened 5553 outpatients, of whom 3012 (54.2%) were COVID-19 suspects managed in the medium-risk zone. Among them, 346 (11.4%) tested COVID-19 positive (57.2% male) and were managed in the high-risk zone with 19 (5.4%) deaths. One (0.08%) of the 1224 HCP in high-risk zone, 6 (0.62%) of 960 HCP in medium-risk zone and 23 (0.18%) of the 12 600 HCP in the low-risk zone tested positive at the end of shift.

Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib. Although a number of studies have been conducted on anti-inflammatory treatments for severe COVID-19, no specific recommendations have been made on which drugs should be used for which patients and when. In this review, we provide an overview of cytokine storm in COVID-19 and treatments currently being used to address it.

Methods: : This was a retrospective review of emergency imaging volumes from January 5 to May 30, 2020. Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute non-traumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control. Results: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001). This reduction can be specifically attributed to decreased uncomplicated diverticulitis cases, as the number of uncomplicated diverticulitis cases dropped significantly (p = 0.002) while there was no significant difference in the number of complicated diverticulitis cases (p = 0.09). Conclusions: : Reduced emergency abdominopelvic CT volume during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially be explained by decreased imaging of lower acuity patients. This data may help formulate future strategies for imaging resource utilization with an improved understanding of the relationship between perceived imaging risk and symptom acuity.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department CT for suspected diverticulitis: A natural experiment to explain patients and clinicians assessment of risk and willingness to undergo CT scanning?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes and play an important role in the early defence against viruses.

In addition, we investigated whether sleep varied as a function of sociodemographic variables, in particular race. Long standing disparities in condition and available resources between racial demographics often lead to disparities in health. At the advent of a pandemic, which strains these systems further, it is important to assess whether or not racial disparities persist. This is important given that racial groups are likely affected by the pandemic, both directly and indirectly, in various ways. Here, we plan to at least assess whether there are any disparities with regard to sleep. METHODS: 4,048 adults (Mage = 45.8 years; 79% women) completed an online survey during April C June 2020. The final samples self-reported race/ethnicity consisted of 84% White, 5.1% Black, 3.4% LatinX, 4.2% Asian or Asian American, and 2.9% Multi-racial. Sleep disturbance was assessed using a retrospective sleep diary and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). RESULTS: Average sleep duration in the sample was 7.1 hours. Participants reported taking on average 32 minutes (SD = 38 mins) to fall asleep and reported waking up for 32 minutes (SD = 53 mins) during the night. Approximately 17% of the sample endorsed clinically elevated insomnia symptoms (based on the ISI  15 cut-off). With regard to racial differences, shorter total sleep time (TST), longer sleep latencies (SL), and greater total ISI scores were observed in Black (mean TST = 6.4 hours; SL = 37.7 minutes; ISI Total = 9.8) and LatinX (mean TST = 6.9 hours; SL = 37.1 minutes; ISI Total = 9.6) participants relative to White participants (Mean TST = 7.1 hours; SL = 30.9 minutes; ISI Total = 8.4). All ps < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic variables, particularly race, should be considered when estimating the relative impact of sleep on overall health.

METHODS: The survey was administered with a web-based form (Google Forms?) to Italian dentists and hygienists. To be enrolled in the study, participants had to reach the adulthood and agree to sign the privacy policy. The impact of Covid-19 was analyzed through a 27-items questionnaire, which was divided into 4 main domains: personal protective equipment (PPE), operative procedures, secretarial organization, and self-reported quality of life (including elearning appraisal). RESULTS: A total of 614 between dentists and dental hygienists completed the questionnaire. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the use of PPE such as face shields, surgical caps and disposable gowns were implemented after the Covid-19 outbreak. Almost the whole interviewed (99.9%) received the Covid-19 vaccine. An increased use of preoperatory mouthwashes and rubber dam was referred during the pandemic, while aerosolization (i.e. ultrasound) was drastically reduced.

PARTICIPANTS: All medical admissions from the emergency department between 10 August 2020 and 4 November 2020 with a valid SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result. INTERVENTIONS: Medical admissions were triaged as likely, possible or unlikely COVID-19 based on clinical criteria. Patients triaged as possible COVID-19 underwent FebriDx lateral flow assay on capillary blood, and those positive for myxovirus resistance protein A (a host response protein) were managed as likely COVID-19. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of the algorithm and the FebriDx assay using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the reference standard. RESULTS: 4.0% (136) of 3443 medical admissions had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 was 46% (80/175) in those triaged as likely, 4.1% (50/1225) in possible and 0.3% (6/2033) in unlikely COVID-19. Using a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR reference standard, clinical triage had sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 91% to 98%) and specificity of 61.5% (95% CI 59.8% to 63.1%), while the triage algorithm including FebriDx had sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and specificity of 86.4% (95% CI 85.2% to 87.5%).

A wide range of strategies have been used to help manage TD, and for those who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the benzodiazepine group of drugs have been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of benzodiazepines for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses. SEARCH METHODS On 17 July 2015 and 26 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including trial registers), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of each included trial for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) and antipsychotic-induced TD that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of TD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently extracted data from the included studies and ensured that they were reliably selected, and quality assessed. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We synthesised continuous data from valid scales using mean differences (MD). For continuous outcomes, we preferred endpoint data to change data. We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. MAIN RESULTS The review now includes four trials (total 75 people, one additional trial since 2006, 21 people) randomising inpatients and outpatients in China and the USA. Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in TD' (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome 'deterioration of TD symptoms,' we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic-induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under-researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen.","output":"Benzodiazepines for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been chosen as a conserved molecular target to develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early changes in host immune responses that are altered with age and the difference in the early host inflammatory response that dictates a symptomatic versus asymptomatic course of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: COVID-19 subjects were identified by screening at the airport upon arrival from a foreign destination to China. Patients were either asymptomatic or had a mild disease when the first oro-pharyngeal (OP) swab samples were collected. Patients were quarantined and blood and throat swabs were collected during the course of the disease, allowing identification of the earliest host response to COVID-19. These patients were followed until their OP sample turned COVID-19 negative. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 126 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The blood samples were obtained within 48 days of qPCR confirmation of viral infection. Older subjects (>30 years) had significantly elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, a significant decrease in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, and expansion in NKT cell fraction. This was associated with significantly elevated viral load and a delayed humoral response in older subjects. Compared to symptomatic subjects, asymptomatic patients had an early increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-2, while a decrease in both T regulatory cells and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Further, asymptomatic disease was associated with early humoral response and faster viral clearance. CONCLUSION: Early inflammatory response potentially plays a critical role for host-defense in COVID-19.

Hence, it has been speculated that the treatment with these agents might influence the course of the infection, and both harmful and beneficial effects have been supposed. Other pharmacological agents are thought to increase ACE2 expression, including statins and proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-) agonists. All these drug classes are broadly adopted in T2D. Besides ACE2, other unknown co-factors might be involved in cell infection. It has been recently observed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) and ACE2 have similar expression profiles in the lung. DPP4 has important metabolic and immune functions and is a target for commonly used therapies in T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical data supporting an influence of all these drugs on the course of the disease are limited, this is an interesting background for further research that might help unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the link between COVID-19 and diabetes.","output":"COVID-19: is there a link between the course of infection and pharmacological agents in diabetes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, are raising concern about the efficiency of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) induced by wild-type infection or vaccines based on the wild-type spike. Methods: We determined IgG and NAb against SARS-CoV-2 variants one year following mild wild-type infection (n=104) and two-dose regimens with BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT) (n=67), ChAdOx1 (ChAd/ChAd) (n=82), or heterologous ChAdOx1 followed by BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT) (n=116). Findings: Wild type spike IgG and NAb remained detectable in 80% (83/104) of unvaccinated participants one year post mild infection. The neutralizing capacity was similar against wild type (reference), Alpha (0.95 (0.92-0.98) and Delta 1.03 (0.95-1.11) but significantly reduced against Beta (0.54 (0.48-0.60)) and Gamma 0.51 (0.44-0.61). Similarly, BNT/BNT and ChAd/ChAd elicited sustained capacity against Alpha and Delta (1.01 (0.78-1.31) and 1.03 (0.95-1.11)) and (0.96 (0.84-1.09) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) respectively), with reduced capacity against Beta (0.67 (0.50-0.88) and 0.53 (0.40-0.71)) and Gamma (0.12 (0.06-0.27) and 0.54 (0.37-0.80)). A similar trend was found following ChAd/BNT (0.74 (0.66-0.83) and 0.70 (0.50-0.97) against Alpha and Delta and 0.29 (0.20-0.42) and 0.13 (0.08-0.20) against Beta and Gamma). Interpretation: Persistent neutralization of the wide-spread Alpha and Delta variants one year after wild-type infection may aid vaccine policy makers in low-resource settings when prioritizing vaccine supply. The reduced capacity of neutralizing Beta and Gamma strains, but not the Alpha and Delta strains following both infection and three different vaccine regimens argues for caution against Beta and Gamma-exclusive mutations in the efforts to optimize next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

In hemodialysis patients, we compared the humoral immunogenicity and tolerability of homologous vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCoV-19/ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 (ChAd/ChAd) and BNT162b2/BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT) with heterologous vaccination of first dose of ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 and a second dose with BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT). METHODS: In a multicenter prospective observational study, SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG antibody levels, Nucleocapsid-protein-IgG-antibodies, and vaccine tolerability were assessed 6 weeks after second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in 137 hemodialysis patients and 24 immunocompetent medical personnel. RESULTS: In COVID-19-na?ve hemodialysis patients, significantly higher median SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG levels were found after ChAd/BNT (N = 16) compared to BNT/BNT (N = 100) or ChAd/ChAd (N = 10) (1744 [25thC75th percentile 276C2840] BAU/mL versus 361 [25thC75th percentile 120C936] BAU/mL; p = 0.009; 1744 [25thC75th percentile 276C2840] BAU/mL versus 100 [25thC75th percentile 41C346] BAU/mL; p = 0.017, respectively). Vaccinated, COVID-19-na?ve medical personnel had median SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG levels of 650 (25thC75th percentile 217C1402) BAU/mL and vaccinated hemodialysis patients with prior COVID-19 7047 (25thC75th percentile 685C10,794) BAU/mL (N = 11). In multivariable regression analysis, heterologous vaccination (ChAd/BNT) of COVID-19-na?ve hemodialysis patients was independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG levels. The first dose of ChAd and the second dose of BNT after the first vaccination with ChAd (heterologous vaccination, ChAd/BNT) were associated with more frequent but manageable side effects compared with homologous BNT. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, heterologous vaccination with ChAd/BNT appears to induce stronger humoral immunity and more frequent but manageable side effects than homologous vaccination with BNT/BNT or with ChAd/ChAd in COVID-19-na?ve hemodialysis patients.

The region is experiencing a significant warming trend with longer and warmer summers, increased frequency and severity of heat waves, and a drier climate. While climate change plays an important role in contributing to political instability in the region through displacement of people, food insecurity, and increased violence, it also increases the risks of vector-, water-, and food-borne diseases. Poorer and less educated people, young children and the elderly, migrants, and those with long-term health problems are at highest risk. A result of the inequalities among EMME countries is an inconsistency in the availability of reliable evidence about the impacts on infectious diseases. To help address this gap, a search of the literature was conducted as a basis for related recommended responses and suggested actions for preparedness and prevention. Since climate change already impacts the health of vulnerable populations in the EMME and will have a greater impact in future years, risk assessment and timely design and implementation of health preparedness and adaptation strategies are essential. Joint national and cross-border infectious diseases management systems for more effective preparedness and prevention are needed, supported by interventions that improve the environment. Without such cooperation and effective interventions, climate change will lead to an increasing morbidity and mortality in the EMME from infectious diseases, with a higher risk for the most vulnerable populations.","output":"Climate change impacts on infectious diseases in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME)risks and recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: COVID-19 has widely impacted hospital services.

We circulated the online survey through the British and Irish Orthoptic Society that reaches over 95% of UK and Irish orthoptic services, and through social media and orthoptic research networks. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 79%. The survey was completed by orthoptic departments, on average 10 days post lockdown. Many orthoptic services were cancelled/paused with remaining services largely reserved for emergency cases and urgent care. A substantial rise in tele-consultations was reported by 94%, which largely consisted of telephone and video calls and which was regarded generally as working well. Barriers to tele-consultations were mainly IT related but with concerns also raised regarding ethical and confidentiality issues. Shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported by one third of departments along with issues relating to conflicting information about the use of PPE.

However, the antitumor efficacy of existing small-molecule IDO1 inhibitors is still unsatisfactory, and the underlying mechanism remains largely undefined. To identify novel IDO1 inhibitors, an in-house natural product library of 2000 natural products was screened for inhibitory activity against recombinant human IDO1. High-throughput fluorescence-based screening identified 79 compounds with inhibitory activity > 30% at 20 M. Nine natural products were further confirmed to inhibit IDO1 activity by > 30% using Ehrlichs reagent reaction. Compounds 2, 7, and 8 were demonstrated to inhibit IDO1 activity in a cellular context. Compounds 2 and 7 were more potent against IDO1 than TDO2 in the enzymatic assay. The kinetic studies showed that compound 2 exhibited noncompetitive inhibition, whereas compounds 7 and 8 were graphically well matched with uncompetitive inhibition. Compounds 7 and 8 were found to bind to the ferric-IDO1 enzyme. Docking stimulations showed that the naphthalene ring of compound 8 formed T-shaped ШC interactions with Phe-163 and that the 6-methyl-naphthalene group formed additional hydrophobic interactions with IDO1.

More recently, similar issues have occurred in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The book presents profiling approaches, offers case studies of major cybersecurity events and provides analysis of password attacks and defenses. Discussing psychological methods used to assess behavioral cybersecurity, alongside risk management, the book also describes game theory and its applications, explores the role of cryptology and steganography in attack and defense scenarios and brings the reader up to date with current research into motivation and attacker/defender personality traits. Written for practitioners in the field, alongside nonspecialists with little prior knowledge of cybersecurity, computer science, or psychology, the book will be of interest to all who need to protect their computing environment from cyber-attacks. The book also provides source materials for courses in this growing area of behavioral cybersecurity. It provides a basis for new approaches to understanding problems in one of our most important areas of research-an approach, agreed upon by most cybersecurity experts, of incorporating not only traditional technical computational and analytic approaches to cybersecurity but also developing psycho-logical and human factor approaches to these problems.

METHODS: We performed a single-arm interventional trial measuring NAb and total antibody titers before and after CP transfusion over a 14-day period in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: NAb titers in the donor CP units were low (<1:40 to 1:160) and had no effect on recipient neutralizing activity 1 day after transfusion.

While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings (Howard et al 2021), studies in community settings report inconsistent results (Brainard et al 2020). Investigating the inconsistency within epidemiological studies, we find that a commonly used proxy, government mask mandates, does not correlate with large increases in mask-wearing in our window of analysis. We thus analyse the effect of mask-wearing on transmission instead, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on 6 continents, including the largest survey of individual-level wearing behaviour (n=20 million) (Kreuter et al 2020). Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we estimate the effect of both mask-wearing and mask-mandates on transmission by linking wearing levels (or mandates) to reported cases in each region, adjusting for mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We assess the robustness of our results in 123 experiments across 22 sensitivity analyses. Across these analyses, we find that an entire population wearing masks in public leads to a median reduction in the reproduction number R of 25.8%, with 95% of the medians between 22.2% and 30.9%. In our window of analysis, the median reduction in $R$ associated with the wearing level observed in each region was 20.4% [2.0%, 23.3%].

The occurrence rates of consolidation, subpleural sparing, crazy-paving pattern, cavity, halo sign, reversed halo sign, air bronchogram, pleural thickening, micronodule, subpleural curvilinear line and multilobar and bilateral involvement in the CT finding of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients. CONCLUSIONS: Many factors are related to the severity of COVID-19, which can help clinicians judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis. This cohort study revealed that male sex, age (&#8805;55 years), patients with any comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease, dyspnoea, increased CRP, D-dimer and NLR, and decreased lymphocyte count and CT findings of consolidation and multilobar involvement were predictors of severe COVID-19.","output":"Relationship between chest computed tomography findings and clinical conditions of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A multicentre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Grand Magal is a religious pilgrimage that takes place in Senegal.

On the basis of global dynamics of two subsystems, for the formulated Filippov system, we examine the sliding mode dynamics, the boundary equilibrium bifurcations, and the global dynamics. Our main results show that it is possible that the pseudo-equilibrium exists and is globally stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium, the disease-free equilibrium and the real equilibrium are tri-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and the real equilibrium are bi-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium are bi-stable, which depend on the threshold value and other parameter values. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium reveals that we may eradicate the disease or maintain the number of infected individuals at a previously given value. Further, the bi-stability and tri-stability imply that whether the number of infected individuals tends to zero or a previously given value or other positive values depends on the parameter values and the initial states of the system.

The aim of this study was to investigate the real world use and adverse events (AE) of vaccines against COVID-19 in IBD patients. Methods: Fully vaccinated IBD patients followed in Greek centers were invited to participate in an anonymous online self reporting survey that included information regarding their demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, vaccination perceptions and potential AEs. Patients were vaccinated with either messenger-RNA or viral vector vaccines that are currently EMA approved. AEs were stated as any kind of new symptom or sign onset, including localized (at the injection site) or systematic ones (fatigue, headache, allergic reactions, fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgias/arthralgias and gastrointestinal disorders). Results: A total of 1007 IBD patients [male 50.5%, median age (IQR) 44 (35-55) years, Crohn's disease 64.3%, history of COVID- 19 infection 2.6%] who completed the survey after they have fulfilled their vaccination program were included. Detailed demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. More than half of the patients (51%) stated that they show confidence in vaccination whereas the rest although reluctant/hesitant admitted the protection it offers. The median (IQR) time between 2nd vaccine dose and questionnaire completion was 15 (5-43) days. There were no serious AEs leading to emergency room visit or hospitalization. Total AEs were reported by 81% after dose 1 (D1) and 76% after dose 2 (D2), reduced to 44% and 51% when excluding isolated injection site reactions respectively. Systemic AEs were more common after D2 (P<0.0001). Very few patients reported new onset abdominal symptoms [abdominal pain 4% (D1), 6% (D2) and diarrhea 5% (D1), 7% (D2)]. In the multiple regression analysis AE occurrence was positively associated with young age and female gender after both doses, whereas inactive disease was negatively associated with AE only in D1 (p=0.044). No association with the use of medications including advanced therapy was found (p>0.05), except from corticosteroids after D2 (p=0.003) but it was a small (32/1007 patients) heterogenous (monotherapy, double or triple immunosupression) sample to draw conclusions. Conclusion: The presence of SARs-CoV-2 vaccination AEs in Greek patients with IBD is similar to the reported in other populations.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, RT-HNC patients were surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression and the distress thermometer (DT) for distress. HADS scores were compared with data pre-COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the COVID-19 impact on daily routines, treatment, and cancer care through a questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. The HADS mean score and estimated rates were 4.34 (4.06)/22% for anxiety and 5.08 (4.82)/22% for depression; in comparison, our historical control had 4.04 (3.59)/20% for anxiety (p = .79) and 4.03 (3.62)/17% for depression (p = .49).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the perception and attitudes of medical students about clinical clerkship training during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey with web-based 3-fields/14-items questionnaire was conducted, from April 7 to 14, 2020, to evaluate their self-assessed perception and attitudes on clerkship training of hospital practice under the COVID-19 outbreak and spread among 161 (78 on pre-clerkship course, 83 on clinical clerkship course) medical students at Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Republic of Korea. RESULTS: Of the 151 medical students who completed the survey, 81 students (53.7%) considered themselves familiar with COVID-19. Although the students were concerned about the spread of the virus during clinical clerkship training, 118 (78.1%) students preferred the clerkship training in a hospital practice. The students in the clinical clerkship program preferred this over those in the pre-clerkship program (85.7% vs. 70.2%, P = 0.03), primarily because a clinical clerkship could not be replaced by an online class during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, their responses indicated, in order of significance, fear of not completing the clerkship course on time, willingness to participate as a preliminary healthcare provider in pandemic, the potential waste of tuition, and belief that a hospital is rather safe. The change in the academic calendar had not a positive impact on the lifestyles of many students.

This leads to duplicate health records, breakdowns in communication, and limited opportunities to provide comprehensive, collaborative care. The objectives of this study were to explore communication challenges and solutions/recommendations from multiple perspectives including (i) parents, (ii) HCPs C hospital and community providers, and (iii) teachers of CMC with a goal of informing patient care. METHODS: This qualitative study utilized an interpretive description methodology. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents and care team members of CMC. The interview guides targeted questions surrounding communication, coordination, access to information and roles in the health system. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two individual interviews were conducted involving parents (n = 16) and care team members (n = 16). Interviews revealed 2 main themes and several associated subthemes (in parentheses): (1) Communication challenges in the care of CMC (organizational policy and technology systems barriers, inadequate access to health information, and lack of partnership in care) (2) Communication solutions (shared systems that can be accessed in real-time, universal access to health information, and partnered contribution to care). CONCLUSION: Parents, HCPs, and teachers face multiple barriers to communication and information accessibility in their efforts to care for CMC. Parents and care providers in this study suggested potential strategies to improve communication including facilitating communication in real-time, universal access to health information and meaningful partnerships.

Based on the data, influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells was analyzed and potential therapeutic compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 were screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS R package \\"DESeq2\\" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The \\"ClusterProfiler\\" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity. The CMap research found that there were three compounds with a median_tau_score less than -90, namely triptolide, tivozanib and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can cause abnormal changes in a large number of molecules and related signaling pathways in human cells, among which IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways may play a key role in pathogenic process of SARS-CoV-2.

Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic use in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9, 2020. Inclusion criteria were any healthcare settings and age groups; randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >10 patients; experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness, and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30,623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3 to 80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.33) compared to adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95%CI 1.18 to 1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies.

The manuscript builds on a cost of opportunity approach to explore the results of potential changes in drug development and its possible economic, political, and societal impacts. EXPERT OPINION The cost of capital is the largest cost category that could be affected by authorities. Public institutions can affect these costs by increasing public investments in R&D and reducing the amount of development time that is associated with a high capital need. In order to affect the cost of failure, it is key to understand its drivers. A government taking risk as the funder of early innovation yields an opportunity to introduce an alternative model for medicine development. Next to control pricing, it is important to adequately reward innovation in order to ensure improving quality of care, access, and affordability of systems.

The nanoparticles (NP) are engineered to provide dual MR contrast by an optimized doping concentration (4.1 at%) of paramagnetic ion, Fe3+, which also renders lossy dielectric character for nCP leading to thermal response under RF exposure.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from 23 January to 23 February 2020 among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital colocated with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of 23 February 2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multipronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures: (1) risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff. RESULTS: A total of 10 583 staff were placed on hospitalwide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of 8 staff illness episodes was seen per day; almost 10% (n = 29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.","output":"Responding to the COVID-19 Outbreak in Singapore: Staff Protection and Staff Temperature and Sickness Surveillance Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic drastically emphasized the fragility of national and international supply networks (SNs),leading to significant supply shortages of essential goods for people, such as food and medical equipment. Severe disruptions that propagate along complex SNs can expose the population of entire regions or even countries to these risks. A lack of both, data and quantitative methodology, has hitherto hindered us to empirically quantify the vulnerability of the population to disruptions. Here we develop a data-driven simulation methodology to locally quantify actual supply losses for the population that result from the cascading of supply disruptions. We demonstrate the method on a large food SN of a European country including 22,938 business premises, 44,355 supply links and 116 local administrative districts. We rank the business premises with respect to their criticality for the districts' population with the proposed systemic risk index, SRIcrit, to identify around 30 premises that -- in case of their failure -- are expected to cause critical supply shortages in sizable fractions of the population. The new methodology is immediately policy relevant as a fact-driven and generalizable crisis management tool.

We specifically focus on livestock production and regulation. We develop a simple economic framework to demonstrate the effect of location on intensification of industrial activity in farming, and discuss this issue in the context of urbanization and economic growth in developing countries. Policy implications of the model are discussed in light of the experience of developed countries in regulating livestock pollution and other externalities. We argue that environmental problems from agricultural industrialization in developing countries may pose major challenges. In the case of livestock production, these are compounded by production intensity, high population densities in periurban and urban areas, and the generally lower public health standards. As the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza epidemics in Asia suggest, the new era of globalization and the onset of a free world trade regime points to the urgent need for developing countries to install inspection and enforcement mechanisms that ensure product safety and quality, as well as minimize the adverse effects on the environment.","output":"Environmental effects of intensification of agriculture: livestock production and regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design optimization of mechanisms is a promising research area as it results in more energy-efficient machines without compromising performance. However, machine builders do not actually use the design methods described in the literature as these algorithms require too much theoretical analysis. Moreover, the design synthesis approaches in the literature predominantly utilize heuristic optimizers leading to suboptimal local minima. This research introduces a convenient optimization workflow allowing wide industrial adoption, while guaranteeing to reveal the global optimum. To guarantee that we find the global optimum, a mathematical expression of the constraints describing the feasible region of possible designs is of great importance. Therefore, kinematic analysis of the point-to-point (PTP) planar four-bar mechanism is discussed to obtain the static and dynamic constraints. Within the feasible region, objective value samples are generated through CAD multi-body software. These motion simulations determine the required torque to fulfill the movement for a certain combination of design parameters. Sparse interpolation techniques allow minimizing the required amount of samples and thus CAD simulations. Moreover, this interpolation of simulation results enables the representation of the objective in a mathematical description without in-depth analytical design analysis by the machine designer. Subsequently, the mathematical expression of the objective allows global optimizers to find a global optimal design within the feasible design space.

PEH may reside at overcrowded shelters, have poor access to health care, and often suffer from significant co-morbid conditions. In this study, we describe prevalence of COVID-19 amongst PEH and homeless service staff in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as demographic data, underlying conditions, and symptoms. METHODS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Atlanta, PEH and homeless service providers were offered PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal, nasal mid-turbinate, and oropharyngeal swabs. Shelters identified as having a higher number of COVID-19 infections underwent re-testing 3C4 weeks after initial testing. Demographic information was collected, and individuals were screened for symptoms and underlying conditions. RESULTS: A total of 2,294 PEH and 544 staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from April 8 - May 6, 2020. 24 homeless shelters were included in this study. The majority of individuals were male (66.3% sheltered, 85.5% unsheltered, 55.3% staff), and 2,192 of 2,838 (78.3%) persons identified as black. Approximately half of individuals had no known underlying conditions (51.5% sheltered, 47.7% unsheltered, 55.5% staff). Cardiovascular disease was the most frequently reported condition (32.0%), followed by chronic lung disease (14.8%). In total, 45 of 2,823 (1.6%) individuals had detectable PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, including 35 of 1,666 (2.1%) sheltered clients, 3 of 614 (0.5%) unsheltered clients, and 7 of 543 (1.3%) staff. Among individuals with detectable SARS-CoV-2, 5 of 20 (25%) reported at least one symptom in the last week. Most shelters (16 of 24) had at least one individual with detectable SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of shelters (19 of 24) was < 3%, with a median prevalence of 0.2% across all shelters. Upon retesting 4 shelters with a higher number of COVID-19 infections, only 3 individuals from 2 shelters tested positive out of 357 total retested (0.8%).

We developed a clinical diagnostic device based on piezo-actuated nanoresonators that perform as quantitative in situ calibrated nano-bio sensors for specific detection of multiple target molecules in serum samples. The immunoassay successfully diagnoses humoral immune responses induced by malaria vaccine candidates and reveals the timeline and stage of the infection. We applied the newly developed strategy to a variety of different samples, from pure antibody/vaccine solutions, to blood samples from clinical trials on both na?ve and pre-exposed malaria volunteers from sub-Saharan countries. Our nanomechanical assay provides a direct one-step label-free quantitative immunoassay that is on par with the gold-standard, multi-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We achieve a limit of detection of few pg ml-1, or sub-pM concentrations. The 6 l sample volume allows more than 50 experiments from one finger prick. Furthermore, we simultaneously detected multiple analytes by differential functionalization of multiple sensors in parallel. The inherent differential read-out with in situ controls reduces false positive results.

Despite this, video-consultations (VC) have not been frequently used in colorectal practice. We assessed outcomes, including the economic and environmental impact of a VC clinic for new colorectal referrals. METHODS A prospective observational study, 50 consecutive patients attending a VC colorectal appointment were reviewed between March 2019 and February 2020. Face-to-face appointments during the same time period were also assessed. The distance, time, cost and carbon emissions of journeys were estimated using web-based resources. Estimated loss of earnings used data from the Office for National Statistics. The subsequent management plans were also recorded. RESULTS Of 50 patients using VC, 40 used home devices and 10 used equipment in their local medical facility. Three patients had technology difficulties and converted to telephone review. The failure to attend VC appointments was less than that for face-to-face appointment (4% versus 6.1%). VC appointments saved 6685 miles travelled (range 2-364 miles), 148 hours travelling time and 1767 cost. Additional savings for loss of earnings were approximately 33.56 per patient. Carbon emissions saved 4659 C02e lb, equivalent to over 250,000 charges of a smartphone.

We have utilized a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to elucidate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2. Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways. Also, we have shown how host epigenetic factors are involved in the deregulation of gene expression. Strikingly, we have found that several transcription factors and other epigenetic factors can modulate some immune signaling pathways, helping both host and virus. We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid oxidation/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated. We observed that these pathways can be either hijacked or suppressed by the viral proteins, leading to the improved viral survival and life-cycle. Moreover, pathways like-Relaxin signaling in lungs suggests aberration by the viral proteins might lead to the lung pathophysiology found in COVID-19.

Two of the major barriers to its consumption are long cooking time and limited shelf life. However, those two hurdles can be overcome through the development of shelf-stable BR pouches to create new ready-to-eat (RTE) products, a food category that is gaining important market shares. Nevertheless, scarce information is available on the production and shelf-life stability of ready-to-eat BR products. The first objective of this study was the determination of the optimal moisture range to fully cook BR. The second objective was to determine the effect of moisture content and storage time on two fundamental parameters for consumers acceptance of rice: color and texture. Three RTE BR pouches with moisture contents of 54%, 57% and 60% were produced and texture and color were evaluated after 1 year of storage. Significant changes in hardness and stickiness were reported during long-term storage. Moisture content negatively affected hardness and positively affected stickiness. Furthermore, storage time and moisture showed a significant effect on rice color.

Although severe COVID-19 is linked to substantial inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not clear2. Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and the release of potent inflammatory mediators3. Here we show that about 6% of blood monocytes of patients with COVID-19 are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on the uptake of antibody-opsonized virus by Fc?3 receptors. The plasma of vaccine recipients does not promote antibody-dependent monocyte infection. SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, but infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in the supernatants of cultures of infected monocytes. Instead, infected cells undergo pyroptosis mediated by activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and gasdermin D. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial and endothelial cells, from lung autopsies from patients with COVID-19 have activated inflammasomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts the production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"Fc?3R-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes activates inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological practice has changed dramatically over the past 125 years.

People's responses to COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to severe, and the disease is sometimes fatal. Its severity is affected by different factors and comorbidities of the infected patients. Living at a high altitude could be another factor that affects the severity of the disease in infected patients. Methods: In the present study, we have analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19-infected patients in Taif, a high-altitude region of Saudi Arabia. In addition, we compared matched diseased subjects to those living at sea level. We hypothesized that people living in high-altitude locations are prone to develop a more severe form of COVID-19 than those living at sea level. Results: Age and a high Charlson comorbidity score were associated with increased numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality among COVID-19 patients. These ICU admissions and fatalities were found mainly in patients with comorbidities. Rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, higher D-dimer, ferritin, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in ICU patients. CRP was the most independent of the laboratory biomarkers found to be potential predictors of death. COVID-19 patients who live at higher altitude developed a less severe form of the disease and had a lower mortality rate, in comparison to matched subjects living at sea level. Conclusion: CRP and Charlson comorbidity scores can be considered predictive of disease severity.

The pandemic reached the Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine in early March 2020, and lockdown immediately ensued. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and predictors of distress and insecurity among Birzeit University's community during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Methods: An online survey completed in March-April 2020 using standardized and previously validated distress and insecurity scales. The survey was placed on the University portal accessed by students, faculty and employees, and was sent by email to faculty and employees. Data were weighted to reflect the University community's distribution. Findings: There were 1,851 participants in the study: 84% were undergraduate students, 10% graduate students, and 6% faculty and employees. Sixty two percent were women. Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 24  9.7). Prevalence of moderate/high distress and insecurity were 40% and 48% respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women, those under 35 years old and those with worse reported income, had significantly higher odds of distress and insecurity compared to their counterparts. Undergraduate students or living with a person at home with high risk of illness with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of distress compared to their counterparts (OR = 1.56, 95%CI[1.13-2.15]) and (OR = 1.34, 95%CI[1.11-1.62]) respectively.

Methods: We use the trajectories of age-specific human and physical capital in the production process to calculate output changes based on a human capital-augmented production function. We also calculate the total burden that results when including the value of lives lost as calculated from mortality rates of COVID-19 and estimates for the value of a statistical life in the United States based on studies assessing individual's willingness to avoid risks. Results: Our results indicate that the GDP loss associated with unmitigated COVID-19 would amount to a cumulative US$1.4 trillion by 2030 assuming that 60 percent of the population is infected over three years. This is equivalent to around 7.7 percent of GDP in 2019 (in constant 2010 US$) or an average tax on yearly output of 0.6 percent. After applying the value of a statistical life to account for the value of lives lost, our analyses show that the total burden can mount to between US$17 to 94 trillion over the next decade, which is equivalent to an annual tax burden between 8 and 43 percent.

In this study, we aimed to identify the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and assess the impact of COVID-19 case finding and contact tracing in each epidemic wave. Methods: : We collected data on COVID-19 cases published by local public health authorities in South Korea and divided the study into two epidemic periods (19 JanuaryC19 April 2020 for the first epidemic wave and 20 AprilC11 August 2020 for the second epidemic wave). To identify changes in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the daily effective reproductive number ( R t ) was estimated using the illness onset of the cases. Furthermore, to identify the characteristics of each epidemic wave, frequencies of cluster types were measured, and age-specific transmission probability matrices and serial intervals were estimated. The proportion of asymptomatic cases and cases with unknown sources of infection were also estimated to assess the changes of infections identified as cases in each wave. Results: : In early May 2020, within 2-weeks of a relaxation in strict social distancing measures, R t increased rapidly from 0.2 to 1.8 within a week and was around 1 until early July 2020. In both epidemic waves, the most frequent cluster types were religious-related activities and transmissions among the same age were more common. Furthermore, children were rarely infectors or infectees, and the mean serial intervals were similar (~3 days) in both waves. The proportion of asymptomatic cases at presentation increased from 22% (in the first wave) to 27% (in the second wave), while the cases with unknown sources of infection were similar in both waves (22% and 24%, respectively).

Physicians should have a low threshold for suspecting stroke in COVID-19 patients, and close observation should be kept on such patients particularly those with clinical evidence of traditional risk factors.","output":"Acute Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke in COVID-19: Mounting Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan (China) during the latter part of December 2019. Indonesia has the fourth-largest population globally and reported the countrys first case of the virus on 2nd March 2020. The World Health Organisation (WHO) in addition to several neighbouring provinces and educational institutions within the region began questioning the Indonesian government upon the initial case reported. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia during March 2020. The data were collected from Indonesian government databases and non-government organisations (NGOs). The data were analysed using Microsoft Office 2019 (Excel) and Adobe Illustrator 2017 software, was used in drawing the map depicting the distribution of COVID-19 in Indonesia. As at 31st March 2020, a total of 1,528 people in Indonesia have been infected by COVID-19, in addition to 136 mortalities (CFR of 8.9%). Jakarta, as the principal capital of Indonesia, quickly has become the epicentre of the virus since this period. Most patient cases were attributed to those aged between 31 and 70 years (72.64%), with male patients (64.93%) representing the highest incidence of cases compared to female patients (35.07%). The number of ventilating machines was 3,326, with hospital numbers at 859. The distribution of cases depicting COVID-19 was mainly seen in urban areas compared to rural areas. Males compared to females, are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, including those aged below 30, between 30 and 60 or above. Indonesia also has the highest case fatality rate (CFR) with respect to mortalities in Southeast Asia and has the second-highest CFR globally. Similarly, while the number of ventilator machines as at 31st March 2020 were sufficient in meeting the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the country, it is possible that the government may need to increase the number of ventilators if the cases continue to escalate.","output":"Epidemiological Characteristics of Early COVID-19 Case Outbreaks in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For those who work in the field of islet transplantation, the microvascular coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung vessels obstructive thrombo-inflammatory syndrome (recently referred to as MicroCLOTS) is familiar, as one cannot fail to recognize the presence of similarities with the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) occurring in the liver hours and days after islet infusion.

While much of this literature falls within the domains of anthropology, science studies, and sociology, this short introductory paper highlights how geographical scholarship can also enrich emerging transdisciplinary debates on uncertainty. Specifically, we discuss how geographers engage with uncertainties produced through and reconfigured by some of the most formidable issues of our contemporary moment, including neoliberal transformation, disease and illness, resource conflict, global climate change, and ongoing struggles around knowledge, power, and justice. In conversation with debates in cognate fields, this special issue brings together contributions that grapple with uncertainty through key geographic concepts such as scale, power, spatiality, place, and human-environment relations.

We introduce a new resource to help research and understand it: ExtremeBB is a structured textual dataset containing nearly 44M posts made by more than 300K registered members on 12 different online extremist forums, enabling both qualitative and quantitative large-scale analyses of historical trends going back two decades. It enables us to trace the evolution of different strands of extremist ideology; to measure levels of toxicity while exploring and developing the tools to do so better; to track the relationships between online subcultures and external political movements such as MAGA and to explore links with misogyny and violence, including radicalisation and recruitment. To illustrate a few potential uses, we apply statistical and data-mining techniques to analyse the online extremist landscape in a variety of ways, from posting patterns through topic modelling to toxicity and the membership overlap across different communities. A picture emerges of communities working as support networks, with complex discussions over a wide variety of topics. The discussions of many topics show a level of disagreement which challenges the perception of homogeneity among these groups. These two features of mutual support and a wide range of attitudes lead us to suggest a more nuanced policy approach than simply shutting down these websites. Censorship might remove the support that lonely and troubled individuals are receiving, and fuel paranoid perceptions that the world is against them, though this must be balanced with other benefits of de-platforming. ExtremeBB can help develop a better understanding of these sub-cultures which may lead to more effective interventions; it also opens up the prospect of research to monitor the effectiveness of any interventions that are undertaken.","output":"ExtremeBB: Enabling Large-Scale Research into Extremism, the Manosphere and Their Correlation by Online Forum Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombosis is a rare complication of COVID-19 vaccines that typically affects cerebral and visceral vessels.

Respiratory decline in patients with COVID-19 is precipitated by a lung-mediated aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose lung radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes for select patients with COVID-19. METHODS A single-institution trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is being performed for the first time. This report describes outcomes of a planned day 7 interim analysis. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidation, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. RESULTS Of 9 patients screened, 5 were treated with whole-lung radiation on April 24 until April 28 2020, and they were followed for a minimum of 7 days. The median age was 90 years (range, 64-94 years), and 4 were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, 3 patients (60%) were weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, 4 (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) was weaned from oxygen at hour 96. The mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS In a pilot trial of 5 oxygen-dependent elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvements in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic consolidation without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation appears to be safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study. LAY SUMMARY Researchers at Emory University report preliminary safety outcomes for patients treated with low-dose lung irradiation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Five residents of nursing or group homes were hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19. Each had pneumonia visible on a chest x-ray, required supplemental oxygen, and experienced a clinical decline in mental status or in work of breathing or a prolonged or escalating supplemental oxygen requirement. A single treatment of low-dose (1.5-Gy) radiation to both lungs was delivered over the course of 10 to 15 minutes. There was no acute toxicity attributable to radiation therapy. Within 24 hours, 4 patients had rapidly improved breathing, and they recovered to room air at an average of 1.5 days (range, 3-96 hours). Three were discharged at a mean time of 12 days, and 1 was preparing for discharge. Blood tests and repeat imaging confirm that low-dose whole-lung radiation treatment appears safe for COVID-19 pneumonia. Further trials are warranted.","output":"Low-dose whole-lung radiation for COVID-19 pneumonia: Planned day 7 interim analysis of a registered clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has emerged as a global threat to humankind and is rapidly spreading. The infectivity, pathogenesis and infection of this virus are dependent on the interaction of SARS-CoV2 spike protein with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes hACE-2. In the present study, we are reporting a de novo designed novel hybrid antiviral 'VTAR-01' molecule that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. A series of antiviral molecules were tested for binding at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. In silico screening, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, ascorbate, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine have strong interaction at the RBD-hACE2 interface. These four molecules were used for de novo fragment-based antiviral design. De novo designing, docking and MDS analysis identified a 'VTAR' hybrid molecule that has better interaction with this interface than all of the antivirals used to design it. We have further used retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis to design 100 variants of VTAR molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis, along with docking and MDS, identified that VTAR-01 interacts with the interface of the RBD-ACE2 complex. MDS analysis confirmed its interaction with the RBD-ACE2 interface by involving Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2, as well as Gln493 and Ser494 of RBD. Interaction of spike protein with ACE2 is essential for pathogenesis and infection of this virus; hence, this i n s ilico designed hybrid antiviral molecule (VTAR-01) that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 may be further developed to control the infection of SARS-CoV2.","output":"De novo design, retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis of a hybrid antiviral (VTAR-01) to inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Emerging data show that hypertension as well as other cardiovascular risk factors may have a major role on outcome in terms of death on patients with COVID-19. We analysed a population of 258 consecutive patients admitted to General Medicine ward of the Hospital of Montichiari (Brixia, Italy) from 29 February to 30 April 2020. Design and method: A group of 258 consecutive patients (173 males and 85 females, aged 71  14) was enrolled. In 168 patients, high-flow oxygen was required (Venturi mask), 20 patients needed orotracheal intubation and 11 were given continuous positive pressure oxygen therapy (CPAP). Patients were treated with the best approach according to available evidence during pandemic period: anti-malaria agents, anti-viral drugs, antibiotics (azithromycin and others), tocilizumab and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). As of June 10th, 65 deaths had been observed. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed with Breslow and Mantel-Cox test. Results: As shown in the table, a significant raise in mortality was observed in patients older than 65 years (p&lt;0.001), of male sex (p&lt;0.001), hypertensives (p&lt;0.001) as well as in patients with heart disease (picture 1;p&lt;0.001), COPD (picture 2;p=0.004), diabetes (p&lt;0.001) and neoplasms (p=0.03) compared with patients with no comorbidities or different diseases, both at discharge and at standard follow-up.

We also discussed the data from two publications indicating the possible use of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Unfortunately, limited information was derived from these studies, as selection methods of candidate-miRNAs and heterogeneity in cardiotoxicity assessment greatly hampered the novelty and robustness of the findings. Nevertheless, at least one circulating miRNA, miR-1, showed a good potential as early biomarker of drug-mediated cardiac dysfunction onset. The use of animal models to investigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity surely helps narrowing the gap between basic research and clinical practice. Despite this, several issues, including selection of relevant miRNAs and less-than-optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity, greatly limited the results obtained so far. Nonetheless, the association of patients-based studies with the use of preclinical models may be the key to address the many unanswered questions regarding the pathophysiology and early detection of cardiotoxicity.","output":"Role of microRNAs in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity: an overview of preclinical models and cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy techniques, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies and cancer vaccines, have been burgeoning with great success, particularly for specific cancer types.

The genome is 29725 nt in size and has 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames). It is composed of a stable region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (composed of 2 ORFs) and a variable region representing 4 CDSs (coding sequences) for viral structural genes (the S, E, M, N proteins) and 5 PUPs (putative uncharacterized proteins).

Thirty putative substitutions have been identified by comparative analysis of the 5 SARS-associated virus genome sequences in GenBank. Fifteen of them lead to possible amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutations) in the proteins. Three amino acid changes, with predicted alteration of physical and chemical features, have been detected in the S protein that is postulated to be involved in the immunoreactions between the virus and its host. Two amino acid changes have been detected in the M protein, which could be related to viral envelope formation.

This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID-19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID-19 infections. Methods and Results In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D-dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. Conclusions We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID-19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID-19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

COVID-19 brought much uncertainty into the lives of people across the world, providing a unique window into the various constructs and individual preferences related to religion and spirituality. While previous findings focus on the importance of religious cues and religiosity in advertising, scholars have not paid much attention to spirituality. A growing number of Americans do not identify with any religion, and studies about the nonreligious, especially atheists and agnostics, are relatively scant. Therefore, the aim of the current study, grounded in congruity theory and cue utilization theory, was to align ad orientation (religious versus spiritual) with individual life orientation (religious versus nonreligious) to explore the impact of these relationships on advertising effectiveness. Findings show that Christians had strong and favorable attitudes toward both the religious and spiritual ads but stronger intention to learn more about the brand only after exposure to the religious ad. In contrast, nonreligious participants had significantly more favorable attitudes and higher intention after exposure to the spiritual ad (versus religious ad). These findings contribute to an initial theoretical understanding of these two groups, with important implications for advertisers.","output":"Exploring the Differential Effects of Religious and Spiritual Cues in Online Advertising: A Study of US Christians and the Nonreligious during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is a concise review of the equity markets' reaction to the COVIDcrisis in 2020.

This study aimed to further confirm the relationship between different blood groups on the vulnerability, symptoms, cure period, and severity among COVID-19 recovered patients. Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study approached the participants from the Arab community via social media (mainly Facebook and WhatsApp). The data were collected through two Google Form questionnaires, one for COVID-19 recovered patients (COVID-19 group, n = 726), and the other for the healthy people (Control group, n = 707). Results: The subjects with blood group O were the least likely to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, while those with blood group A were not likely to be the most susceptible. There were significant differences among different ABO blood groups regarding the distribution of oxygen saturation percentage, myalgia, and recovery time after COVID-19 infection (p < 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively). The blood group A showed the highest percentage of patients who experienced an oxygen saturation range of 90-100%, whereas the blood group O showed the highest percentage of patients who experienced an oxygen saturation range of 70-80%. The blood group A showed the lowest percentage of patients who required artificial respiration, whereas the blood group O showed the highest percentage of patients who required artificial respiration. The blood group B showed the lowest percentage of patients who experienced myalgia and exhibited the lowest percentage of patients who needed 3 weeks or more to recover.

In addition, this study aims to investigate the relationship between online search behaviors about COVID-19 and the spreading speed of virus among different region and the effect of applied some precautionary strategies on search behavior. METHODS: The following search terms were used to investigate awareness of COVID-19;\\"Corona+ Korona\\",\\"Coronavirus+Koronavirus+Koronavirus \\", \\" \\"Covid 19\\"+\\"Covid-19\\" \\", \\"Pandemi (pandemic)\\", \\"Salgin (epidemic)\\". In this study, plus sign (+) which means \\"OR\\" was used to represent the combination of those multiple terms. Then relative search volumes (RSV) were determined for the most searching these keywords in country. Finaly, for the purpose of comparing the difference of public perception and attantion about COVID-19 across Turkey, (1) The similarity between the day when MoH announces the numbers of death and case, and nd the day when RSV reached the apex, (2) The similarity between the day when official autority announces the precoution strategy and the day when RSV reached the apex were evaluaded. RESULTS: Searches related to COVID-19 in Turkey rapidly increased following around January 30, 2020 when the epidemic was announced in China and reached a small peak. Then clear peak was seen around February 26,2020 when the number of infections rapidly increased in Italy. Finally, the apex point was seen around March 11,2020 when the announcements of the first case in the country.

The remarkable evolutionary rate of this virus represents an often unsurmountable challenge to its control, leading to the emergence of different lineages featured by different biological properties and limited cross-protection. In the present study, the origin, spreading and evolution of GI-23, one of the most important IBV emerging lineages, has been reconstructed using a phylodynamic approach. To this purpose, the broadest available collection of complete and partial S1 sequences was downloaded from GenBank and merged with specifically sequenced European strains. After a likely ancient origin, GI-23 circulated undetected in the Middle East for a considerable time, thereafter emerging as a threat in parallel with the intensification of the poultry industry and its introduction in other countries. An intensive viral circulation affecting mainly neighbouring countries or those with strong economic and political relationships was demonstrated, even though some nations appear to play a major role as a bridge among less related locations. Of note, a big recombinant cluster, likely originating in the Middle East but spreading thereafter, especially to Europe through Turkey, demonstrated a much-marked increase in viral population size, and potentially fitness, compared to previously circulating variants. ABSTRACT: Infectious bronchitis virus GI-23 lineage, although described approximately two decades ago in the Middle East, has recently drawn remarkable attention and is considered an emerging lineage due to its current spread to several other regions, including Europe. Despite the relevance, no comprehensive studies are available investigating its epidemiologic and evolutionary pattern. The present phylodynamic study was designed to fill this gap, benefitting from a collection of freely available GI-23 sequences and ad-hoc generated European ones. After a relatively ancient origin in the Middle East, likely in the first half of the previous century, GI-23 circulated largely undetected or underdiagnosed for a long time in this region, likely causing little damage, potentially because of low virulence coupled with limited development of avian industry in the considered years and regions and insufficient diagnostic activity. The following development of the poultry industry and spread to other countries led to a progressive but slow increase of viral population size between the late 90s and 2010. An increase in viral virulence could also be hypothesized. Of note, a big recombinant cluster, likely originating in the Middle East but spreading thereafter, especially to Europe through Turkey, demonstrated a much-marked increase in viral population size compared to previously circulating variants. The extensive available GI-23 sequence datasets allowed to demonstrate several potential epidemiological links among African, Asian, and European countries, not described for other IBV lineages. However, differently from previously investigated IBV lineages, its spread appears to primarily involve neighbouring countries and those with strong economic and political relationships. It could thus be speculated that frequent effective contacts among locations are necessary for efficient strain transmission. Some countries appear to play a major role as a bridge among less related locations, being Turkey the most relevant example. The role of vaccination in controlling the viral population was also tentatively evaluated. However, despite some evidence suggesting such an effect, the bias in sequence and data availability and the variability in the applied vaccination protocols prevent robust conclusions and warrant further investigations.","output":"Phylodynamic and Recombination Analyses of Avian Infectious Bronchitis GI-23 Reveal a Widespread Recombinant Cluster and New Among-Countries Linkages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients have historically travelled from across the world to the United States for medical care that is not accessible locally or not available at the same perceived quality.

A circular stapler often is used for B-I gastroduodenostomy in open and laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy. Recently, totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) has been considered less invasive than laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy, and many institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy are trying to progress to TLDG without markedly changing the anastomosis method. The purpose of this report is to introduce the technical details of new methods of intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy using either a circular or linear stapler and to evaluate their technical feasibility and safety. METHODS Seventeen patients who underwent TLDG with the intracorporeal double-stapling technique using a circular stapler (n = 7) or the book-binding technique (BBT) using a linear stapler (n = 10) between February 2010 and April 2011 were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathological data, surgical data, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery in any of the 17 patients. The usual postoperative complications following gastroduodenostomy, such as anastomotic leakage and stenosis, were not observed. Anastomosis took significantly longer to complete with DST (64  24 min) than with BBT (34  7 min), but more stapler cartridges were needed with BBT than with DST. CONCLUSIONS TLDG using a circular or linear stapler is feasible and safe to perform. DST will enable institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy with circular staplers to progress to TLDG without problems, and this progression may be more economical because fewer stapler cartridges are used during surgery. However, if an institution has already been performing  anastomosis in TLDG but has been experiencing certain issues with  anastomosis, converting from  anastomosis to BBT should be beneficial.","output":"Progression from laparoscopic-assisted to totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy: comparison of circular stapler (i-DST) and linear stapler (BBT) for intracorporeal anastomosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: With the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health institutions and hospitals are increasingly relying on e-learning for continuing education.

METHODS: We collected participants demographic information including health profession, place of work, work unit, and year of graduation. There were six independent webinars included in this study. Webinar outcomes included satisfaction and learning scores. Regarding satisfaction, participants were told to complete a satisfaction survey and asked whether they would recommend the webinar to their colleagues. Regarding learning, information on their mean pre-test and post-test scores was collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,607 health professionals were enrolled, with the highest participation in webinars about emergency cases and COVID-19 management. The response towards satisfaction was overwhelmingly positive. In all six webinars, post-test scores were statistically significantly higher than pre-test scores. Recently graduated physicians scored higher in learning than senior physicians, while place of work and work unit did not significantly affect the scores.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the various factors in health and food access, and their spatial correlation and statistical association with COVID-19 spread. The minor aim is to explore regression models on examining COVID-19 spread with these variables. To address these objectives, we are studying the interrelation of various socio-economic factors that would help all humans to better prepare for the next pandemic. One of these critical factors is food access and food distribution as it could be high-risk population density places that are spreading the virus infections. More variables, such as income and people density, would influence the pandemic spread. In this study, we produced the spatial extent of COVID-19 cases with food outlets by using the spatial analysis method of geographic information systems. The methodology consisted of clustering techniques and overlaying the spatial extent mapping of the clusters of food outlets and the infected cases. Post-mapping, we analyzed these clusters proximity for any spatial variability, correlations between them, and their causal relationships. The quantitative analyses of the health issues and food access areas against COVID-19 infections and deaths were performed using machine learning regression techniques to understand the multi-variate factors.

Significant reductions were also seen for total cholesterol with saxagliptin versus metformin (MD: -0.15 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.23, -0.08, I2 = 0%, very low grade evidence). Significant reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) were seen for atorvastatin versus placebo (MD: -1.51 mmol/L; 95% CI: -3.26 to 0.24, I2 = 75%, very low-grade evidence). CONCLUSION: There were significant reductions in the lipid parameters when metformin, atorvastatin, saxagliptin, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were compared with placebo or other agents. There was also a significant reduction of CRP with atorvastatin.","output":"Effect of pharmacological interventions on lipid profiles and C-reactive protein in polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Less than 3 months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and within a month of the WHO declaring COVID19 a global pandemic, COVID-19 infections and fatalities have grown exponentially, globally.

The supply chain to deliver these medicines is complex, with fragmented data systems and limited visibility on performance. This study empirically evaluates the impact of an online supply chain performance measurement system, NTDeliver, providing understanding of the value of information sharing towards the success of global health programs. Methods Retrospective secondary data was extracted from NTDeliver, which included 1,484 shipments for four critical medicines ordered by over 100 countries between February 28, 2006 and December 31, 2018. We applied statistical regression models to analyze the impact on key performance metrics, comparing data before and after the system was implemented. Findings The results suggest information sharing has a positive impact on three performance indicators: purchase order timeliness (=1.01, p<0.000), arrival timeliness (=0.53, p=0.09), andmost importantlydelivery timeliness (=0.73, p=0.03). Three variables indicated an increased positive impact when the data is publicly shared: shipment timeliness (=2.57, p=0.001), arrival timeliness (=2.88, p=0003), and delivery timeliness (=2.82, p=0.01). Conclusions Our findings suggest that information sharing between the NTD program partners can help drive improved performance in the supply chain, and even more so when data is shared publicly. Given the large volume of medicine and the significant number of people requiring these medicines, information sharing has the potential to provide improvements to global health programs affecting the health of tens to hundreds of millions of people Author Summary The supply chain to deliver donated preventive chemotherapy medicines is complex due to the many stakeholders and partnerships participating, as well as challenging because the logistics are further complicated by delivery to remote destinations in developing countries. As MDA campaigns involve treating hundreds of thousands to millions of patients in endemic regions within entire countries over the course of days or weeks, close coordination and timing of medicine delivery is critical. Inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems and limited transparency on supply chain performance further challenges the ability to identify shipment issues and explore the root cause of the issues. Prior to 2016, delivery was performing below standards, lagging as much as 40% below the WHO target of 80% on-time delivery. These delays result in wasted medicine donations, increased program costs, delayed MDAs, or sometimes even completely missed MDAs. In September 2016, an online supply chain performance measurement system, NTDeliver, was launched by the NTD Supply Chain Forum (a public-private partnership focused on managing and improving the PC donation supply chain) to enhance supply chain performance and information transparency. Our findings suggest that information sharing through NTDeliver is positively associated with performance at several key stages in NTD supply chain and that information sharing has more substantial positive impact on performance when the information is made publicly accessible, focused towards country program managers. The study findings support investment in supply chain systems and commitment to data transparency, in the context of a growing focus on supply chain investment in NTD programs.","output":"Improving Timeliness in the Neglected Tropical Diseases Preventive Chemotherapy Donation Supply Chain through Information Sharing: A Retrospective Empirical Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: By investigating the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among residents during a period of low transmission, this study reflects the long-term impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify which categories of residents are more likely to develop PTSD due to an acute infectious disease crisis, facilitating the development of targeted strategies to protect mental health after outbreaks of similar acute infectious diseases in the future. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in China from 4 to 26 February 2021. A convenience sampling strategy was adopted to recruit participants. Participants were asked to complete the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A multivariable linear stepwise regression analysis model was used to identify which factors were associated with PTSD in residents of China. Results: A total of 2,361 Chinese residents completed the questionnaire. The mean PCL-5 score for the respondents was 13.65 (SD = 8.66), with 219 (9.28%) patients having probable PTSD symptoms. Respondents who were female ( = 0.038), had a relative or friend who had contracted COVID-19 ( = 0.041), and had poor health ( = 0.184) had higher PCL-5 scores, while the population aged over 60 years ( = ?0.063), who agreed that COVID-19 information was released in a timely manner ( = ?0.347), who had experienced a relatively limited impact of COVID-19 on their life ( = ?0.069), and who agreed that the local prevention initiatives were sophisticated ( = ?0.165) had lower PTSD scores.

While tectonic plate motions provide evidence for this relation, the mechanism by which mantle processes influence near-surface tectonics remains elusive. Here, we present an azimuthal anisotropy model for the Pacific Northwest crust that strongly correlates with high-velocity structures in the underlying mantle but shows no association with the regional mantle flow field. We suggest that the crustal anisotropy is decoupled from horizontal basal tractions and, instead, created by upper mantle vertical loading, which generates pressure gradients that drive channelized flow in the mid-lower crust. We then demonstrate the interplay between mantle heterogeneities and lithosphere dynamics by predicting the viscous crustal flow that is driven by local buoyancy sources within the upper mantle. Our findings reveal how mantle vertical load distribution can actively control crustal deformation on a scale of several hundred kilometers.","output":"Seismic anisotropy reveals crustal flow driven by mantle vertical loading in the Pacific NW"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are many prognostic factors for treatment outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD). The predictive power of any single factor, however, is limited. We aimed to develop profiles of antidepressant response and remission based upon hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors. METHODS Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome. An automated algorithm was used to determine the optimal predictive variables by evaluating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and test efficiency. RESULTS Hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors yielded profiles that significantly predicted treatment outcome. In contrast to an overall 47% response rate in STAR*D Level 1, response rates of profiled patient subgroups ranged from 31 to 63%. In contrast to an overall remission rate of 28%, identified subsets of patients had a 12 to 55% probability of remission. The predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome most commonly incorporated into profiles were related to socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), whereas indicators of depressive symptom type and severity, as well as comorbid clinical conditions, were useful but less powerful predictors. CONCLUSIONS Hierarchical profiles of demographic and clinical baseline variables categorized patients according to the likelihood they would benefit from a single antidepressant trial.

Those residing in areas of high population density are at an elevated risk, suggesting that residence in an overcrowded household may result in heightened vulnerability. However, as the association between residing in an overcrowded household and risk of mortality from COVID-19 is unknown, the purpose of this study was to analyze this relationship. Methods: COVID-19 data was acquired for each of the 85 cities in Los Angeles County, the region with the highest number of recorded cases in the US, along with data on housing and demographics. Overcrowded households were defined as having 1.0+ persons per room. Bivariate regression was performed between the number of overcrowded households and the number of COVID-19 deaths. Backwards stepwise linear regression was then conducted with risk factors for COVID-19 mortality as potentially eligible input variables. Collinearity was assessed by considering the variance inflation factors (VIF);variables with high collinearity (VIF above 8) were removed. Results: Bivariate regression indicated that the number of overcrowded households was positively associated with the number of COVID-19 deaths (standardized  = 0.844, p &lt; 0.001). COVID-19 case totals, number of individuals aged 60 or above, and number of overcrowded households met conditions for inclusion in the backwards stepwise linear regression model. This analysis revealed that all three of these independent variables were positively associated with number of deaths, with the largest effect being seen with overcrowded housing (standardized  = 0.386, p = 0.001), followed by number of cases (standardized  = 0.307, p = 0.014), and number of individuals aged 60+ (standardized  = 0.282, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Overcrowded housing was found to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in this study and served as a better predictor of number of deaths than the number of people 60+, and even the total number of COVID-19 cases. These findings have important implications for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. While age and comorbidities have frequently been described as risk factors for poor outcomes, these findings indicate a critical need for COVID-19 control efforts to more thoroughly assess for overcrowded housing. Furthermore, the striking absence of research on overcrowded housing indicates a clear direction for future studies.","output":"Overcrowded housing increases risk for covid-19 mortality: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can cause shortness of breath, lung damage, and impaired respiratory function. Containing the virus has proven difficult, in large part due to its high transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic incubation.

A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3  9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included- 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while negative for COVID-19 but experiencing symptoms). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 24 people, 320 samples); (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n = 190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model's ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms.","output":"Analyzing changes in respiratory rate to predict the risk of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine has been used to treat malaria for more than 70 years.

METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation.

METHOD: Two conjoint experiments about priority over ICU treatment and early COVID-19 vaccination were implemented in a probability-based sample of 1461 respondents representative of the Netherlands. Respondents were asked who should receive treatment out of two fictitious healthcare claimants that differed in in age, weight, complying with corona policy measures, and occupation, all randomly assigned. Average marginal coefficient effects are estimated to assess the relative importance of the attributes; attributes were interacted with relevant respondent characteristics to find whether consensus exists in this relative ranking. RESULTS: The Dutch penalize those not complying with coronavirus policy measures, and the obese, but prioritize those employed in crucial sectors. For these conditions, there is consensus among the population. For age, young people are prioritized for ICU treatment, while the middle-aged are given priority over a vaccine, with younger respondents favoring healthcare for elderly claimants, while older respondents favor support for young cohorts.

Little is known regarding its frequency and phenotype. We examined the frequency of thalamic aphasia following Isolated Acute unilateral ischemic Lesions in the Thalamus (IALT) with respect to lesion location. Furthermore, we characterized thalamic aphasia according to affected language domains and severity. METHODS Fifty-two patients with IALT were analyzed [44% female, median age: 73 years (IQR: 60-79)]. Lesion location was determined using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as anterior, posterior, paramedian or inferolateral. Standardized language assessment was performed using the validated Aphasia checklist (ACL) directly after symptom onset. Aphasia was defined as an ACL sum score of < 135 (range: 0-148). RESULTS Of 52 patients, 23 (44%) fulfilled the ACL diagnostic criteria for aphasia, including nearly all lesion locations and both sides. The average ACL sum score was 132  11 (range: 98-147). Aphasia was characterized by deficits within domains of complex understanding of speech and verbal fluency. Patients with left anterior IALT were most severely affected, having significantly lower ACL scores than all other patients (117  13 vs. 135  8; p < 0.001).

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 618 inpatients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection admitted to 36 Spanish hospitals between July 2009 and February 2010. Risk factors evaluated included host-related factors and clinical data at admission. We developed a composite index of severe in-hospital complications (SIHC), which included: mortality, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and requirement for resuscitation maneuvers. Six factors were independently associated with SIHC: age >45 years, male sex, number of comorbidities, pneumonia, dyspnea, and confusion. From the  parameter obtained in the multivariate model, a weight was assigned to each factor to compute the individual influenza risk score. The score shows an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77. The SIHC rate was 1.9 % in the low-risk group, 10.3 % in the intermediate-risk group, and 29.6 % in the high-risk group. The odds ratio for complications was 21.8 for the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group.

Accordingly, the serological detection of corresponding antibodies would be beneficial to diagnose PEDV indirectly to control the disease. In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant truncated spike (S) protein of PEDV was developed and validated. RESULTS: The reaction conditions of the developed indirect ELISA were optimized. This indirect ELISA was compared to indirect immunoinfluscent assay (IFA), and the overall coincidence rate was 96.74% based on testing 368 clinical serum samples with different PEDV antibody levels. No cross-reactivity with other common swine pathogens was detected for the developed S1 indirect ELISA. Finally, the S1 indirect ELISA was applied to detect serum antibodies of 3304 field samples collected from different pig farms in eastern China, and it presented an overall substantial agreement on the PEDV infection status. CONCLUSIONS: This established S1 indirect ELISA is capable of detecting serum antibodies against PEDV, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it could be applied for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection.","output":"Development and application of an indirect ELISA for the detection of antibodies to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus based on a recombinant spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of using surgical masks in community settings to reduce the probability of infection by SARS-CoV-2 or other acute viral respiratory infection, compared to not using surgical masks.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 suppresses host but not viral translation through a bipartite mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary hemorrhage is a potentially serious complication of radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary neoplasms that may occur with or without hemoptysis.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) are widely used clinical diagnostic tools to monitor for abnormal brain and cardiac rhythms in patients. Here, a technique to simultaneously record video, EEG, and ECG in mice to measure behavior, brain, and cardiac activities, respectively, is described. The technique described herein utilizes a tethered (i.e., wired) recording configuration in which the implanted electrode on the head of the mouse is hard-wired to the recording equipment. Compared to wireless telemetry recording systems, the tethered arrangement possesses several technical advantages such as a greater possible number of channels for recording EEG or other biopotentials; lower electrode costs; and greater frequency bandwidth (i.e., sampling rate) of recordings. The basics of this technique can also be easily modified to accommodate recording other biosignals, such as electromyography (EMG) or plethysmography for assessment of muscle and respiratory activity, respectively. In addition to describing how to perform the EEG-ECG recordings, we also detail methods to quantify the resulting data for seizures, EEG spectral power, cardiac function, and heart rate variability, which we demonstrate in an example experiment using a mouse with epilepsy due to Kcna1 gene deletion.

Both the fear of infection and the imposed restrictions can have biopsychosocial consequences. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether there is a difference in the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of primary school children in 2014/15 compared to in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The present study included 1,712 children aged 5 to 11 years who either participated in the baseline assessment of the SOPHYA cohort study in 2014/15 or were newly recruited during follow-up of the cohort in 2020. In both surveys, the children invited for participation were identified based on registry data. HRQoL was assessed with the validated KINDL-R questionnaire, which scores HRQoL along six different dimensions. RESULTS The overall scores (82.4 [81.8; 83.0] vs. 79.6 [79,1; 80.2]), and in particular the emotional well-being scores (85.6 [84.6; 86.6] vs. 83.3 [82.4; 84.2]), were lower during the year of the pandemic (2020) compared to the survey year 2014/15. The highest decrease between 2014/15 and 2020 in the adjusted models was seen for the youngest age group (-3.9 points), followed by children from families with a high income (-3.2 points), girls (-3.1 points), Swiss citizens (-3.1 points) and children from the German-speaking part of Switzerland (-3.1 points). HRQoL was particularly low during periods with restrictions and at the height of the COVID-19 waves in 2020. CONCLUSION The SOPHYA-study showed that HRQoL, and especially emotional well-being, was lower in 5 to 11-year-old children in Switzerland during the first year of the pandemic compared to the results from the survey conducted in 2014/15. In the year of the pandemic, the scores were lowest at the height of the COVID-19 waves and their associated restrictions. As it cannot be distinguished whether fear of the disease itself or the restrictions caused this decrease in HRQoL, containment policies should keep COVID-19 infections as low as possible, but still enable children to profit from protective factors such as leisure activities, physical activity and social contact.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and health related quality of life in primary school children in Switzerland: a repeated cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las infecciones del tracto respiratorio superior se hallan entre las ms frecuentes, y generan ms consultas mdicas que cualquier otro tipo de enfermedad infecciosa.

RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative study using a qualitative content analysis of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We purposively sampled 31 nurses caring for Covid-19 patients in the acute care units within large academic medical systems in Maryland and New York City during April to June 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. RESULTS: We identified themes and sub-themes representative of major causes of moral distress in nurses caring Covid-19 patients. These included (a) lack of knowledge and uncertainty regarding how to treat a new illness; (b) being overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the Covid-19 illness; (c) fear of exposure to the virus leading to suboptimal care; (d) adopting a team model of nursing care that caused intra-professional tensions and miscommunications; (e) policies to reduce viral transmission (visitation policy and PPE policy) that prevented nurses to assume their caring role; (f) practicing within crisis standards of care; and (g) dealing with medical resource scarcity. Participants discussed their coping mechanisms and suggested future strategies. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our study affirms new causes of moral distress related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Then, the obtained structures of CB1R with the N terminus were used for ligand docking. A natural cannabinoid receptor agonist, &#916;9-THC, was docked to the orthosteric site and a negative allosteric modulator, CBD, to the allosteric site positioned between extracellular ends of helices TM1 and TM2. The molecular dynamics simulations were then performed for CB1R with ligands: (i) CBD together with THC, and (ii) THC-only. Analyses of the differences in the residue-residue interaction patterns between those two cases allowed us to elucidate the allosteric network responsible for the modulation of the CB1R by CBD. In addition, we identified the changes in the orthosteric binding mode of &#916;9-THC, as well as the changes in its binding energy, caused by the CBD allosteric binding.

Upon the cooperative activity of specific Ubiquitinating enzymes, ISG15 can be conjugated to its substrates. Increasing evidence points to a role for protein ISGylation in anti-viral and anti-tumoral defense. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified ISG15 from Old World Monkeys (OWm) as a hyper-efficient protein modifier. Western blot analysis visualized more efficient conjugation of OWmISG15 relative to HuISG15 in human (Hu), monkey and mouse (Mo) cell-lines. Moreover, the substrates of OWmISG15 identified upon Tandem Affinity Purification followed by LC-MS/MS identification largely outnumbered these of HuISG15 itself. Several Ubiquitin-Conjugating enzymes were identified as novel ISGylated substrates. Introduction of a N89D mutation in HuISG15 improved its ISGylation capacity, and additional Q31K/T33A/D133N mutations yielded a HuISG15 variant with an ISGylation efficiency comparable to OWmISG15. Homology modeling and structural superposition situate N89 in the interaction interface with the Activating enzyme. Analysis of the UbE1L residues in this interface revealed a striking homology between OWmUbE1L and HuUbE1, the Activating enzyme of Ubiquitin. In line with this observation, we found efficient activation of AgmISG15, but not HuISG15 or MoISG15, by HuUbE1, thus providing a likely explanation for OWm hyperISGylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study discloses the poor conjugation competence of HuISG15 compared to OWmISG15 and maps the critical determinants for efficient conjugation.

We proposed a hypothesis to initiate coagulation following flow-diversion treatment. An experimental model was used by ligating rat's right common carotid artery (RCCA) to create flow-stasis environment. Thrombus formed in RCCA as a result of flow stasis. The fibrin distributions in different sections along the axial length of RCCA were measured. The fibrin distribution predicted by our computational model displayed a trend of increase from the proximal neck to the distal tip, consistent with the experimental results on rats. The model was applied on a saccular aneurysm treated with flow diverter to investigate thrombus development following flow diversion. Thrombus was predicted to form inside the sac, and the aneurysm was occluded with only a small remnant neck remained.

However, the relative severity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in children is unknown. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study was performed at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago, academic free-standing childrens hospital. We included all children  18 years-old diagnosed with COVID-19 between October 15(th), 2020 and August 31(st), 2021 and whose SARS-CoV-2 isolate was sequenced using the Illumina platform. For each patient sample, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 lineage, which was assigned to one of the following groups: Non-VOC, alpha VOC, beta VOC, gamma VOC, or delta VOC. We measured frequency of 5 markers of COVID-19 severity: hospitalization; COVID-19 pharmacologic treatment; respiratory support; intensive care unit admission; and severe disease as classified by the COVID-19 World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale (severe disease; score 3 6). A series of logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds of each severity marker with each VOC (in comparison to non-VOCs), adjusting for COVID-19 community incidence and demographic and clinical co-variates. RESULTS: During the study period, 2,025 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 1,422 (70.2%) had sufficient viral load to permit sequencing. Among the 499 (35.1%) patients whose isolate was sequenced, median (inter-quartile range) age was 7 (1,12) years; 256 (51.3%) isolates were a VOC: 96 (37.5%) alpha, 38 (14.8%) gamma, and 119 (46.5%) delta. After adjusting for age, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, high-risk medical conditions, and COVID-19 community incidence, neither alpha nor delta was associated with severe COVID-19. Gamma was independently associated with hospitalization (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.6C21.5, p=0.007), respiratory support (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.5C56.3, p=0.02), and severe disease as classified by the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (OR 7.7, 95% CI 1.0C78.1, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-VOC COVID-19 infections, the gamma VOC, but not the alpha or delta VOCs, was associated with increased severity. These data suggest that recent increased in pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations are related to increased delta COVID-19 incidence rather than increased delta virulence in children.","output":"Severity of Illness Caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Variants of Concern in Children: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have reported a waning of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

Hungary is in the unique position to use six different vaccines (including the Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines, for which limited evidence was available prior to the present study) in the same, relatively homogeneous population. All vaccines provided high level of protection initially which declined over time. While the picture is different in each age group, the waning of immunity is apparent for all vaccines and especially in the younger age groups and the Si-nopharm, Sputnik-V and AstraZeneca vaccines, which performed similarly. This is clearly reversed by booster doses, more prominent for those vaccines, where recipients were more likely to take the booster dose (which were the aforementioned three vaccines).

We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women. Methods: 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. Results: Vaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. Conclusions: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women.

We present the case of a 50-year-old lady with recurrent microvascular and macrovascular thromboses who was initially treated with endovascular stents and amputation progressing to require immunosuppression and anticoagulation, to include steroids, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. Case report - Case description A 50-year-old lady presented to the Emergency Department with bilateral leg and abdominal pain. Her co-morbidities included type two diabetes, psoriasis, three miscarriages, borderline personality disorder and a heavy smoking history. Clinical examination revealed pulse deficits in the distal lower limbs with gangrene evidence of ischaemia on her toe digits. CT angiogram demonstrated complete thrombus of the Infrarenal abdominal aorta extending to the common iliac and external iliac arteries bilaterally. Thrombolysis ensued and an aortic stent was inserted with symptom relief. Two weeks later readmission occurred with bilateral leg pain;Ultrasound Doppler revealed a tight stenosis at the distal aortic region. Initial management consisted of Intravenous heparin but worsening ischaemia resulted in insertion of kissing stents at the aortic bifurcation. The patients pain settled with no residual arterial compromise. One month later the patient was re-admitted with bilateral leg pain and necrotic right toes;this led to a right forefoot amputation. A triphasic bilateral finger colour change was noted with ischaemic pain and livedo reticularis on lower limbs, with a decision to institute Iloprost and methylprednisolone ensued. Antiphospholipid antibodies returned showing triple positivity. Management subsequently included addition of IV rituximab, plasma exchange, IVIG and sildenafil. Two months later the patient was re-admitted with complete lower limb paralysis due to a complete thrombus of the aortic bi-iliac stent;thrombolysis ensued with good result. A further admission 1- month later occurred due to sepsis and an infected necrotic left forefoot resulting in an above knee amputation. No further endovascular stenting was advised to risk of embolic seeding following medical management. Case report - Discussion We have described a case of cAPS on a previously asymptomatic female patient who presented with diffuse peripheral and central thromboses. Our patient suffered from intra-abdominal organ infarction and subsequent acute kidney injury, recurrent arterial and venous occlusion over a period of 12 months and previous pulmonary emboli. Livedo reticularis and gangrene were visible cutaneous manifestations of this disorder on our patient. cAPS accounts for less than 1% of APS and has a high mortality of 50% which means early and frequent discussion with specialist centres is important. In addition to the clinical features described in our patient, laboratory features included moderate thrombocytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis (raised bilirubin and LDH). The cAPS registry demonstrates that the majority of patients are female (72%) with a mean age of 37 years, 46% have primary APS, 40% suffer from SLE and 9% from other autoimmune diseases. This patient does not have a secondary autoimmune condition. The most common clinical features to present before cAPS develops include foetal loss, previous DVT or thrombocytopaenia, two of which our patient demonstrated. The prognosis and clinical features of cAPS have been shown to depend on the extent of thrombosis, organs affected and the presence of a systemic immune response from affected tissues. Treatment options available for cAPS consist of multiorgan support, anticoagulation and immunosuppression, in the form of glucocorticoids, rituximab, IV Immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. Our patient required all of these due to ac elerating thrombosis as determined by new gangrene, ongoing livedo reticularis rash and thrombocytopenia. Case report - Key learning points Our case demonstrates the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for cAPS as up to 46% will have this as their first presenting feature of APS  including our patient. On her admission to hospital particular attention was paid to clinical examination which suggested Raynauds and a skin rash consistent with livedo reticularis  this prompted a rheumatology consult, serology testing, starting Iloprost and tertiary centre transfer. The diagnosis was secure with high titre of IgG anticardiolipin antibody, anti Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies and Lupus Anticoagulant detected  all on two occasions more than 12 weeks apart. Patients may present to surgical specialties in view of peripheral vascular symptoms and signs. It would be appropriate to identify patients with APS early to prevent multiple surgeries or considerations for endovascular stents, as they are frequently not successful. This case highlights the need for discussion and education within the multi-disciplinary setting for patients with APS, including surgical teams. Finally, the risk of immunosuppression for patients who have received rituximab can persist for up to 12 months following treatment and this lady also had the co-morbidity of diabetes. This patients risk stratification was high in view of COVID-19 and she was advised to shield until government guidelines ended last year. Currently she is doing well without new symptoms and she will be reviewed at 6 months following rituximab, in the Autumn of 2021.","output":"Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome presenting as diffuse peripheral and central thromboses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 crisis, there has been insufficient reporting regarding the evaluation of students' performance in biology courses in medical schools.

Methods Decision-analytic Markov models were conducted to evaluate the costs and benefits of traditional and telemedicine combined AMD and DR screening from a societal perspective. A cohort of all participants aged 50 years old and above was followed through a total of 30 1-year Markov cycles. Separate analyses were performed for rural and urban settings. Relevant parameters such as the prevalence of AMD and DR, transition probability, compliance with screening and treatment, screening sensitivity, specificity, utility, and mortality were collected from published studies specific to China, other Asian counties' studies, or unpublished data sources such as the National Committee for the Prevention of Blindness. Costs of screening, full examination, and treatment come from the real medical environments and unified pricing of Beijing Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau. Primary outcomes were incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using years of blindness avoided. One-way deterministic and simulated probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty. Findings Under the status quo, the total expected medical costs for a 50-year-old patient with AMD or DR were $86959 and $1,51418 in rural and urban settings, respectively. Both traditional and telemedicine screening were highly cost-effective. In rural settings, ICURs were $191 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $66 to $239) and $199 (95% CI: $-12 to $217), and ICERs were $2,436 (95% CI: $1,089 to $3,254) and $2,441 (95% CI: $1,452 to $3,900) for traditional and telemedicine screening separately. Even more surprising, both screening strategies dominated no screening in urban settings. Our results were insensitive and robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. Among all acceptable screening intervals (from 1 to 5 years), annual screening could not only produce biggest benefits but also keep ICERs less than three times and one time the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in rural and urban settings separately. When compared with traditional screening, ICERs of telescreening were less than three times the per capita GDP in rural settings ($2,559 to $8,809) and less than one time the per capita GDP in urban settings (less than $5,564), annual telescreening produced the biggest benefits, it could avert 119 and 270 years of blindness in rural and urban areas separately when 100,000 people were screened. Interpretation We performed decision-analytic Markov models for combined AMD and DR screening in rural and urban China, and the results showed that population-level combined screening for AMD and DR is likely to be highly cost-effective in both rural and urban China for people over 50 years old.

DESIGN: Qualitative study including observations and semistructured interviews conducted over 3 months. SETTING: A nonCCOVID-19 adult general medical unit in an academic tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs based on the unit. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study in which we (1) observed HCW activities and proximity to each other on the unit during weekday shifts JulyCOctober 2020 and (2) conducted semi-structured interviews of HCWs to understand their experiences with and perspectives of physical distancing in the hospital. Qualitative data were coded based on a human-factors engineering model. RESULTS: We completed 25 hours of observations and 20 HCW interviews. High-risk interactions often occurred during handoffs of care at shift changes and patient rounds, when HCWs gathered regularly in close proximity for at least 15 minutes. Identified barriers included spacing and availability of computers, the need to communicate confidential patient information, and the desire to maintain relationships at work. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing can be improved in hospitals by restructuring computer workstations, work rooms, and break rooms; applying visible cognitive aids; adapting shift times; and supporting rounds and meetings with virtual conferencing. Additional strategies to promote staff adherence to physical distancing include rewarding positive behaviors, having peer leaders model physical distancing, and encouraging additional safe avenues for social connection at a safe distance.","output":"Barriers to physical distancing among healthcare workers on an academic hospital unit during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading around the world, increasing evidence highlights the role of cardiometabolic risk factors in determining the susceptibility to the disease.

The survival tree approach was applied to define a multilayer risk stratification and better profile patient survival with respect to drug regimens, showing a significant protective effect of RAASi with a reduced risk of in-hospital death. Bayesian networks were estimated, to uncover complex interrelationships and confounding effects. The results confirmed the role of RAASi in reducing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients.

The association between virus infection and telomere length is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the putative associations between leukocyte telomere length (TL), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a national representative sample of noninstitutionalized population. METHODS: We analyzed data that was collected in a cross-sectional setting, where 3,987 participants were enrolled with available data on telomere length. The association between telomere length with previous CMV infection and CRP was analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. We further tested if obesity, measured by body mass index (BMI), and smoking could modify this relationship. RESULTS: In total, around 46% percent of the study population were men and 54% were women. Average ages were 35.1 years for men and 35.0 years for women. One unit increase of CMV antibody IgG titer was associated with -0.07 (95% confidence interval: -0.12, -0.01) unit decrease of leukocyte TL when sex was adjusted for. After additionally adjusting for BMI and smoking status, the magnitude of the association was only slightly decreased to -0.06 (95% confidence interval: -0.11, -0.01). The effect sizes were comparable after additionally adjusting for CRP. These analyses imply that previous CMV infection affects leukocyte TL through pathways other than CRP.

We generated Huh-7-derived cell lines resistant to brefeldin A (BFA), which is an inhibitor of this pathway. The resistant cell lines could be sorted into two phenotypes regarding BFA-induced toxicity, inhibition of albumin secretion, and inhibition of HCV infection. Two cell lines were more than 100 times more resistant to BFA than the parental Huh-7 cells in these 3 assays. This resistant phenotype was correlated with the presence of a point mutation in the Sec7 domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA. Surprisingly, the morphology of the cis-Golgi of these cells remained sensitive to BFA at concentrations of the drug that allowed albumin secretion, indicating a dichotomy between the phenotypes of secretion and Golgi morphology. Cells of the second group were about 10 times more resistant than parental Huh-7 cells to the BFA-induced toxicity. The EC(50) for albumin secretion was only 1.5C1.8 fold higher in these cells than in Huh-7 cells. However their level of secretion in the presence of inhibitory doses of BFA was 5 to 15 times higher. Despite this partially effective secretory pathway in the presence of BFA, the HCV infection was almost as sensitive to BFA as in Huh-7 cells. This suggests that the function of GBF1 in HCV replication does not simply reflect its role of regulator of the secretory pathway of the host cell. Thus, our results confirm the involvement of GBF1 in HCV replication, and suggest that GBF1 might fulfill another function, in addition to the regulation of the secretory pathway, during HCV replication.","output":"Hepatitis C Virus Replication and Golgi Function in Brefeldin A-Resistant Hepatoma-Derived Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women are at greater risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), because of their altered immunity and strained cardiovascular system. Emerging studies of placenta, embryos, and cerebral organoids suggest that fetal organs including brain could also be vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, a case study from Paris has reported transient neurological complications in neonates born to pregnant mothers. However, it remains poorly understood whether the fetal brain expresses cellular components that interact with Spike protein (S) of coronaviruses, which facilitates fusion of virus and host cell membrane and is the primary protein in viral entry. To address this question, we analyzed the expression of known (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN) and novel (ZDHHC5, GOLGA7, and ATP1A1) S protein interactors in publicly available fetal brain bulk and single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis across multiple regions of fetal brain spanning 8 weeks post conception (wpc)?37wpc indicates that two of the known S protein interactors are expressed at low levels with median normalized gene expression values ranging from 0.08 to 0.06 (ACE2) and 0.01C0.02 (TMPRSS2). However, the third known S protein interactor FURIN is highly expressed (11.1C44.09) in fetal brain. Interestingly, all three novel S protein interactors are abundantly expressed throughout fetal brain development with median normalized gene expression values ranging from 20.38C21.60 (ZDHHC5), 92.47C68.35 (GOLGA7), and 65.45C194.5 (ATP1A1). Moreover, the peaks of expression of novel interactors is around 12C26wpc. Using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets, we further show that novel S protein interactors show higher co-expression with neurons than with neural progenitors and astrocytes. These results suggest that even though two of the known S protein interactors are present at low levels in fetal brain, novel S protein interactors are abundantly present and could play a direct or indirect role in SARS-CoV-2 fetal brain pathogenesis, especially during the 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters of pregnancy.","output":"Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in Human Fetal Brain Development Suggest Early Pregnancy Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In addition to many deaths due to the Coronavirus pandemic, many psychological issues and problems are affecting people's health.

The present contribution is part of an ongoing study of lichen diversity of the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues. It aims to unravel the diversity of the genus Porina s.l. on these islands and to improve the taxonomy and the phylogeny of the family Porinaceae following the morphological study and the sequencing of recently collected material. Material and methods C Lichens were collected in 2016 and 2019 in a range of environments, from lowland dry habitats up to dense evergreen upland forests on the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues. In total, 85 samples of Porina were examined using light microscopy. A molecular study using mtSSU sequences was performed in order to investigate the phylogenetic position of the species of Porina occurring in the study area. Key results C The analyses revealed the presence of 23 species of Porina s.l. in Mauritius, while only four were previously accepted for this country. Five new species are described: Porina covidii, P. griffithsii, P. mauritiana, P. nuculoides, and P. rupicola, while two sterile species remain unidentified. The mtSSU phylogenetic tree includes 19 of the 23 species occurring in Mauritius. These species are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic tree, in at least eight main and strongly supported lineages, suggesting multiple colonizations of Mauritius. A new lineage only including Paleotropical and mainly foliicolous species (P. epiphylloides, P. longispora, P. mauritiana, and P. mazosioides) is revealed. Pseudosagedia crocynioides, a species that was previously known only from Florida, is newly reported from Mauritius, highlighting a remarkable disjunct distribution. Photos of each taxon are provided, along with an identification key to all species. Conclusion C The study of the genus Porina in Mauritius highlights a rich flora. The true diversity of Porina species in the south-western Indian Ocean is certainly underestimated and in need of further investigation, while a taxonomic-phylogenetic revision of tropical Porina at a broader geographical scale is highly desirable.

This has been very much the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare professionals at the frontline facing physical exhaustion, mental health challenges associated with stigma, limited family time, and the passing of those seeking healthcare. In addition to some of the psychosocial factors impacting on healthcare professionals, the surge in the available evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic made clinical decision making cumbersome, as evidence-based medicine attempted to address clinical decision-making through the best available evidence together with clinical expertise and patient values. Researchers and academics rapidly responded to this public health emergency through the generation of knowledge that aimed to be both relevant and timeous to address the needs of the pandemic and halt the number of infections for those at great risk. The rapid response meant that while researchers aimed to inform the public and the scientific community about advances in science, methodological and ethical dilemmas emerged as part of evidence based decision-making. Cutting corners and producing evidence rapidly often meant that researchers and academics needed thoughtful reflection about whether they are guilty of exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic for academic progression while losing methodological and ethical integrity. In April 2020, the WHO database reported 5,362 COVID-19-related studies and numerous online COVID-19 collections (such as the Living Overview of Evidence platform and the Living Systematic Map of Evidence, to name but two). Would the adaptations to evidence-based medicine that the pandemic brought about change how evidence generation and synthesis is conducted in the future? Simultaneously, it could also suggest that this is the shift from traditional research methods and approaches to ones that are changing with the times in light of the fourth industrial revolution and the current pandemic. Some reflections that researchers and academics might need to consider to avoid jeopardising the methodological and ethical integrity of scientific contributions are set out in. All attempts at global public health research and evidence-based medicine should take place while the researcher reflects on how she/ he can ensure that the knowledge generated and shared can be relevant to help clinicians and the general public, locally. The language that is used in the dissemination and knowledge translation of evidence that emerges from research during the COVID-19 pandemic should also consider the availability of evidence in languages other than English, both languages widely spoken internationally and locally.","output":"Reflections for global public health research and evidence-based medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by different phenotypes and clinical presentations.

Mean censoring-adjusted duration of hospitalization was 10.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 0.8-30.1) among survivors and 13.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 1.7-34.6) among non-survivors. Among all hospitalized confirmed cases, censoring-adjusted probabilities of ICU admission and mortality were 41.9% (95% confidence interval: 34.1-51.4%) and 17.8% (14.3-22.2%), respectively, and higher among men than women. We estimated RE was 1.43 (1.17-1.73), 2.09 (1.63-2.69), and 1.47 (0.07-2.59) in Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, respectively, for infections acquired March 1, 2020. RE declined to 0.98 (0.76-1.27), 0.89 (0.74-1.06), and 0.92 (0.05-1.55) respectively, for infections acquired March 20, 2020. Conclusions: We identify high probability of ICU admission, long durations of stay, and considerable mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the western United States. Reductions in RE have occurred in conjunction with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of hospitalized 2019 coronavirus disease among 9,596,321 individuals residing in California and Washington, United States: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from the oro/pharyngeal swabs of two Italian COVID-19 patients, physicians in a COVID-19 division hospital, with different courses of the disease. The complete genome sequences show that the two isolates belong to the B1.1 lineage, but contain a nucleotide mutation in the ORF6, leading to a stop codon and to the deletion of 6 amino acids in the C terminus. This deletion was unique, compared to the currently available sequences deposited in the GISAID and GenBank database. It did not affect the in vitro viral replication, neither the neutralizing activities of the patients' antibodies. Based on homology analysis with other Coronaviruses, the two isolated lacked the ORF6 aminoacidic portion responsible for the inhibition of the antiviral Interferon (IFN)-based host response. IFN seems to have a dual role of in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: not only antiviral activity, but also a detrimental role in case of excessive production.

Anxiety and fear appear to be the main psychological symptoms associated with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate whether anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 are influenced by sociodemographics and whether specific conditions, such as positivity for COVID-19 or death among relatives and friends, can further enhance these symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, 697 Italians responded to an online survey assessing sociodemographic information, the presence/absence of positive cases, or deaths due to COVID-19 among relatives or acquaintances. The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS-19S) were administered in order to assess the levels of anxiety and fear associated with COVID-19. The data were collected in November 2020. Anxiety and fear scores were positively correlated. Both male and female subjects with higher CAS scores also displayed higher FCS-19S scores. The CAS and FCS-19S scores tended to increase with age, with older subjects exhibiting higher scores than younger subjects. Additionally, respondents with lower educational levels demonstrated higher scores on both the CAS and FCS-19S. Similarly, respondents living with older people and/or experiencing the death of one or more relatives due to COVID-19 exhibited corresponding outcomes. This study demonstrates how the levels of anxiety and fear, measured by CAS and FCS-19S associated with COVID-19, are influenced by gender, age, cohabitation status, educational levels, and the presence of positive cases or deaths due to COVID-19.","output":"A Psychometric Examination of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale and the Fear of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Scale in the Italian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-center, prospective observational cohort study from March 23, 2020 through June 1, 2020. We followed all women receiving either clarithromycin or no macrolide antibiotic for adjunct surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries. The primary outcome was development of postpartum endometritis. Secondary outcomes included meconium-stained amniotic fluid at time of cesarean delivery, neonatal sepsis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients in this study were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted negative. RESULTS: This study included 240 patients, with 133 patients receiving clarithromycin and 107 patients receiving no adjunct macrolide prophylaxis. Patients receiving clarithromycin were noted to have significantly lower rates of postpartum endometritis as compared to those who did not receive adjunct prophylaxis (4.5% versus 11.2%, p = 0.025). In crude (unadjusted) analysis, a significantly lower risk of developing endometritis was noted in the clarithromycin group as compared to the control group (66% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.95, p = 0.040). When adjusted for perceived confounders, a significant difference was again noted (67% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97, p = 0.034). Stratified analysis of significantly different demographic factors including Black race, BMI, and age was performed. A significantly decreased risk of development of endometritis when taking clarithromycin versus no adjunct macrolide was noted for Black race women in crude and adjusted models (crude: 87% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83, p = 0.032; adjusted: 91% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79, p = 0.026). This was also noted for women aged 18-29 years in crude and adjusted models (crude: model, 79% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.014; adjusted model: 75% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94, p = 0.028). All other stratified analyses did not yield significant differences in endometritis risk. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that administration of clarithromycin for adjunctive surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries may be a safe option that may provide suitable endometritis prophylaxis in cases where azithromycin is unavailable, as was the case during the start of COVID-19 pandemic, most especially for Black race women and women ages 18-29 years.","output":"Clarithromycin use for adjunct surgical prophylaxis before non-elective cesarean deliveries to adapt to azithromycin shortages in COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gamification is an innovative approach to engaging in activities that people believe as less interesting. Recycling has been an issue not taken aware by the people in environmental sustainability. There are substantial studies on recycling intention due to the continual growth of unethical and unsustainable waste disposal. Creative approaches to recycling awareness activities should be made to fulfil youths increasing interest in and demand for recycling. The main objective of this study is to explore the factors related to youths recycling intentions after experiencing a gamified online recycling learning activity, Edcraft Gamified Learning (EGL). Gamified recycling education is believed to be a practical and engaging approach for youths. Methods: 100 students participated in EGL, consisting of two levels of plastic crafting and recycling activities. They experienced online EGL at home between May and September in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic total lockdown in Malaysia, namely, Movement Control Order (MCO). 29 participants were selected to participate in five focus group discussions (FGDs) with five to eight participants per session to explore their opinions towards gamified learning, motivation and recycling intention. Results: This paper reports the findings of the FGDs. A codebook was developed based on the codes from the FGD feedback. The codes were rated by two raters, followed by an assessment of inter-rater reliability and thematic analysis. The findings emerged and were confirmed with four themes as factors that influence recycling intention. They are gameful experience, social influence, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: The dependent variable, recycling intention, was connected to the four themes to verify the conceptual framework. One limitation of the study was the design of the EGL activity, which was only carried out over two days with two levels of gamified recycling education, as students had concurrent academic online classes during that period.","output":"Playing Edcraft at Home: Gamified Online Learning for Recycling Intention during Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has dominated people's lives since late 2019, for more than nine months now.

Moreover, we studied whether reversion reduced cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS From the population-based KORA S4/F4/FF4 cohort study conducted in Southern Germany, we utilized data from the second and third visit to the study center (median follow-up 6.5 years). We used two overlapping data sets, one with 563 persons with HbA1c<6.5% (mean age 69 years, 51.5% men), one with 510 persons with glucose-based prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance. We calculated proportions of reversion, and estimated adjusted relative risks for the association between initial BMI/WC and change of BMI/WC, respectively, and reversion (and persistence of normoglycaemia, respectively). We estimated 10-year cardiovascular risks using the Framingham 2008 score. Overall, 27.3% of persons with HbA1c-defined prediabetes and 9.2% of persons with glucose-based prediabetes returned to normoglycaemia during follow-up. Lower initial BMI/WC and reduction of BMI/WC were associated with larger probabilities of returning to normoglycaemia (e.g., for HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, RR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.09-1.41) per 1 kg/m2 decline of BMI). Moreover, reduction of BMI/WC increased probabilities of maintaining normoglycaemia (e.g., for glucose-based prediabetes, RR = 1.09 (1.02-1.16) per 1 kg/m2 decline of BMI). 10-year cardiovascular risk was 5.6 (1.7-9.6) percentage points lower after reversion from glucose-based prediabetes to normoglycaemia.

METHODS: 116 patients (72 men and 44 women) who had received a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament between September 2019 and December 2020 were included in this study. These patients were divided into two groups depending on the date of surgery: one group that had received surgery in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and one group that had undergone surgery in 2020 and was directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire regarding the influence of the coronavirus pandemic on the medical and physiotherapeutic follow-up care, as well as the moment of return to work. In addition, the range of motion of the respective knee 3 months postoperatively was analysed based on physical examination. RESULTS: At 3 months postoperatively, patients who had undergone surgery in 2020 showed a clear trend towards a higher frequency of extension deficits of  5 (18.8% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.097) or an inability to bend the knee  120 (23.3% vs. 10%, p = 0.197) compared to those who had received surgery in 2019. Patients who had undergone surgery in 2020 reported significantly longer delays for appointments, a higher number of futile attempts to get an appointment and a higher number of cancelled appointments, regarding both medical and physiotherapeutic follow-up care. 34.9% of the patients who received surgery in 2020 indicated that they were able to reduce the duration of their sick leave due to the increased possibilities of working in a home-office situation during the pandemic. Alternative treatment options due to the pandemic were offered by 13.3% of the physiotherapists and 12.2% of the physicians. CONCLUSION: Although the physiotherapeutic and medical follow-up care was not directly affected by a lockdown, the pandemic led to significant restrictions, which are also reflected in a clear trend towards worse clinical outcomes. Consequently, a further expansion of alternative treatment options, which were only offered by 12C13% of practices and that are presumably of comparable relevance for various other diseases, is needed.","output":"Einfluss der COVID-19-Pandemie auf die physiotherapeutische und ?rztliche Nachsorge nach Rekonstruktionen des vorderen Kreuzbandes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute renal failure (ARF) is a clinical critical syndrome with rapid and severe decline of renal function.

Anti-S-RBD concentrations were observed to increase 10-fold (30.44 AU/ml at 1st and 310.64 AU/ml at 3rd months) in participants infected after the vaccination and to decrease among people aged 50 years and older. ConclusionAntibody concentrations at the 1st and 3rd months after the vaccination with two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were found to be decreased, but still detectable (except in one participant). As participants who had COVID-19 at a mean of 181 (90-330) days before the vaccination presented with a more stable antibody level, it can be concluded that a booster at months 6-12, resulting in a schedule of 0-1-6 months, is recommended for the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","output":"Humoral immune response in inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: When should a booster dose be administered?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bubbles are pairs of internally vertex-disjoint (s, t)-paths in a directed graph. In de Bruijn graphs built from reads of RNA and DNA data, bubbles represent interesting biological events, such as alternative splicing (AS) and allelic differences (SNPs and indels). However, the set of all bubbles in a de Bruijn graph built from real data is usually too large to be efficiently enumerated and analysed in practice. In particular, despite significant research done in this area, listing bubbles still remains the main bottleneck for tools that detect AS events in a reference-free context. Recently, in [1] the concept of a bubble generator was introduced as a way for obtaining a compact representation of the bubble space of a graph. Although this generator was quite effective in finding AS events, preliminary experiments showed that it is about 5 times slower than state-of-art methods. In this paper we propose a new family of bubble generators which improve substantially on the previous generator: generators in this new family are about two orders of magnitude faster and are still able to achieve similar precision in identifying AS events.

Here, we have assessed a total of 104 blood specimens, consisting of convalescent samples after infection with early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (pre-VOC) or with Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta, post-vaccination samples after double-dose mRNA-vaccination as well as samples after vaccine break-through infections with Delta or Omicron. Neutralization against seven authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta, Omicron) was assessed by plaque-reduction neutralization assay. We found highest neutralization titers against the homologous (previously infecting) variant, with lower neutralization efficiency against heterologous variants. Loss of neutralization against heterologous variants showed considerably variability between convalescent groups suggesting that a variant-specific infection background influences immune escape characteristics. Convalescent samples from pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta-infected individuals all showed a significant loss of neutralization for Omicron but to a varying degree (23.0-fold in Beta-convalescent up to 56.1-fold in Alpha-convalescent samples), suggesting that infection-derived immunity, independent of the infecting variant is most likely only poorly protective against Omicron. Of note, former variant of concern Zeta showed also a pronounced escape form neutralization of up to 28.2-fold in Alpha convalescent samples. Two-dose vaccinated individuals showed robust neutralization against B.1 and only slightly lower neutralization titers for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Zeta, with fold-change reduction for heterologous virus between 2.8 (for Alpha) to 6.9 (for Beta). In contrast to convalescent specimens, escape from neutralization for Zeta was largely restored in vaccinated individuals, while Omicron showed a strongly reduced neutralization of 85.7-fold compared to pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2. Robust neutralization titers were observed in double-vaccinated individuals with subsequent Delta break-through infections, that also neutralized Omicron with a loss of only 12.5-fold. Individuals with an Omicron breakthrough infection showed high neutralization titers for both Delta and Omicron, with only a 1.5-fold loss for Delta neutralization. This suggests that infection with antigenically different variants can boost immunity against variants that are antigenically similar to the vaccine strain. We conclude that for the assessment of escape from neutralization by new VOCs such as Omicron, the complexity of background immunity due to individual and regional differences needs to be taken into account. Geographic variation in the proportion of individual with infection- or vaccination-derived immunity or a combination of both could have substantial influence on the course of the pandemic. Combined infection/vaccination immunity after break-through infections could ultimately lead to broad immunity also against non-homologous variants.","output":"Neutralization of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Omicron by mRNA vaccination and infection-derived immunity through homologous and heterologous variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A remarkable increase in HA titers for weakly haemagglutinating Norwegian arbovirus strains, Uukuniemi and Runde viruses, was achieved by including treatment with the colloidal silica gel Aerosil in the antigen preparation scheme.

However, clinical manifestations between SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS and non-SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS are quite common, and their therapeutic treatments are limited because the intricated pathophysiology having been not fully understood. In this study, to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS and non-SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, first, we constructed a candidate host-pathogen interspecies genome-wide genetic and epigenetic network (HPI-GWGEN) via database mining. With the help of host-pathogen RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, real HPI-GWGEN of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS were obtained by system modeling, system identification, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) model order selection method to delete the false positives in candidate HPI-GWGEN. For the convenience of mitigation, the principal network projection (PNP) approach is utilized to extract core HPI-GWGEN, and then the corresponding core signaling pathways of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS are annotated via their core HPI-GWGEN by KEGG pathways. In order to design multiple-molecule drugs of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS, we identified essential biomarkers as drug targets of pathogenesis by comparing the core signal pathways between COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS. The deep neural network of the drugCtarget interaction (DNN-DTI) model could be trained by drugCtarget interaction databases in advance to predict candidate drugs for the identified biomarkers. We further narrowed down these predicted drug candidates to repurpose potential multiple-molecule drugs by the filters of drug design specifications, including regulation ability, sensitivity, excretion, toxicity, and drug-likeness.

OBJECTIVES The objectives pf the study were to analyze the performance of a chest computed tomography (CT) AI quantitative algorithm for determining the risk of mortality/mechanical ventilation (MV) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and explore a prognostic multivariate model in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City. METHODS Chest CT images of 166 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from April 1 to 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed using AI algorithm software. Data were collected from their medical records. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of the relevant CT variables using the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]). Optimal thresholds were obtained using the Youden index. We proposed a predictive logistic model for each outcome based on CT AI measures and predetermined laboratory and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The highest diagnostic yield of the assessed CT variables for mortality was the percentage of total opacity (threshold >51%; AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 74%, and specificity = 91%). The AUC of the CT severity score (threshold > 12.5) was 0.88 for MV (sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 92%). The proposed prognostic models include the percentage of opacity and lactate dehydrogenase level for mortality and troponin I and CT severity score for MV requirement.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients in a tertiary-care pediatric hospital system who had MIS-C per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition during the period March 2020 to February 2021. EXPOSURES: Immunomodulatory therapy within the first 24 hours (patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) or 48 hours (non-ICU patients): corticosteroids alone, IVIG alone, and IVIG plus corticosteroids. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was failure of initial therapy, defined as therapy escalation due to fever or worsening or lack of improvement of laboratory, cardiac, or noncardiac clinical factors after 24 hours (ICU patients) or 48 hours (non-ICU patients) from time of therapy initiation, per clinician assessment. Secondary outcomes included presence of complications, cardiovascular outcomes, fever duration, length of hospital and ICU stays, corticosteroid use duration, and need for readmission. RESULTS: Among 228 eligible patients, 215 patients were included in the univariate analysis; median age was 8 years, and 135 (62.8%) were boys. There were 69 patients in the corticosteroids group, 31 patients in the IVIG group, and 115 patients in the IVIG plus corticosteroids group. Patients in the corticosteroids group had milder disease at presentation. After propensity score weighting including 179 patients (68 in the corticosteroids group and 111 in the IVIG plus corticosteroids group), rates of initial treatment failure were similar between groups. Among patients whose initial treatment failed, treatment failure in the IVIG plus corticosteroids group was more likely to be based on laboratory parameters (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.07-3.60) and less likely to be based on cardiovascular markers (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.2-0.76), per clinician assessment. Patients in the IVIG plus corticosteroids group had a longer median inpatient stay (6 vs 5 days; P = .001) and longer median corticosteroid course duration (10 vs 5 days; P = .04) compared with the corticosteroids group. Forty-nine patients (71% of 69 in the corticosteroids group) recovered after receiving corticosteroid monotherapy for 10 days or less.

Since its etiopathology is still under discussion, the development of novel biomarkers is critical for the correct classification of the patients in order to open personalized treatment options, on the one hand, and to separate true IC/BPS from the numerous confusable diseases with comparable symptom spectra on the other hand. There is growing evidence supporting the notion that the classical or Hunner-type IC (HIC) and the non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC) are different diseases with different etiopathologies and different pathophysiology at the full-blown state. While genetic alterations indicate close relationship to allergic and autoimmune diseases, at present, the genetic origin of IC/BPS could be identified. Disturbed angiogenesis and impairment of the microvessels could be linked to altered humoral signaling cascades leading to enhanced VEGF levels which in turn could enhance leucocyte and mast cell invasion. Recurrent or chronic urinary tract infection has been speculated to promote IC/BPS. New findings show that occult virus infections occurred in most IC/BPS patients and that the urinary microbiome was altered, supporting the hypothesis of infections as major players in IC/BPS. Environmental and nutritional factors may also influence IC/BPS, at least at a late state (e.g., cigarette smoking can enhance IC/BPS symptoms). The damage of the urothelial barrier could possibly be the result of many different causality chains and mark the final state of IC/BPS, the causes of this development having been introduced years ago.

Our bias-correction methods allowed an accurate estimation of the information place cells carry about the animal's position (spatial information) and uncovered the spatial resolution of hippocampal coding.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April 21 to May 10, 2020, using an online survey among the Bangladeshi physicians living in the country. Both univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of the willingness of the physicians to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: More than 69% physicians reported that they were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.9% reported that they were not willing, while 21.4% of participants were not sure about their willingness. Younger age, having experience of treating patients during previous pandemics, working in the emergency departments and high self-reported compliance to the recommended PPE were important predictors of being willing to work during COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for family and risk of transmitting the infection to family members were most commonly reported as major barriers of working during the pandemic (30%) followed by having comorbidities (25%), lack of adequate safety measures (25%), fear of being infected (12.2%), not involved in clinical practice (12.5%) etc. CONCLUSIONS: Though the majority of the physicians were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, sufficient supply of PPE, support to maintain recommended quarantine and isolation policy after risky hospital duty along with adequate and effective training can increase their willingness to continue their sacred duty during this crucial pandemic.","output":"Willingness to work during initial lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic: Study based on an online survey among physicians of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Introgression of the insect bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations been shown in randomised and non-randomised trials to reduce the incidence of dengue in treated communities, however evidence for the real-world effectiveness of large-scale Wolbachia mosquito deployments for arboviral disease control in endemic settings is still limited and no effectiveness studies have been conducted for chikungunya virus. A large Wolbachia (wMel strain) program was implemented in 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Here we assess the impact of the release program on dengue and chikungunya incidence. Methods and findings The program released 67 million wMel infected mosquitoes across 28,489 release locations over a 86.8km2 area in Rio de Janeiro between August 2017 and the end of 2019. Following releases, mosquitoes were trapped and the presence of wMel determined. To assess the impact of the release program on dengue and chikungunya incidence, we used spatiotemporally explicit models applied to geocoded dengue (N=194,330) and chikungunya cases (N=58,364) from 2010 (2016 for chikungunya) to 2019 from across the city. On average, 32% of mosquitoes collected from the release zones between 1 and 29 months after releases were positive for wMel. Reduced wMel introgression occurred in locations and seasonal periods when dengue and chikungunya cases were historically high. Despite incomplete introgression, we found that the releases were associated with a 38% (95%CI: 32-44%) reduction in dengue incidence and a 10% (95%CI: 4-16%) reduction in chikungunya incidence.

However, whether neurons or other cells in the CNS sometimes survive infection and the effects of infection on neuronal function is largely unknown. To address this question, we used the rJHM strain (rJ) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute encephalitis in susceptible strains of mice. To determine whether neurons or other CNS cells survive acute infection with this virulent virus, we developed a recombinant JHMV that expresses Cre recombinase (rJ-Cre) and infected mice that universally expressed a silent (floxed) version of tdTomato. Infection of these mice with rJ-Cre resulted in expression of tdTomato in host cells. The results showed that some cells were able to survive the infection, as demonstrated by continued tdTomato expression after virus antigen could no longer be detected. Most notably, interneurons in the olfactory bulb, which are known to be inhibitory, represented a large fraction of the surviving cells. In conclusion, our results indicated that some neurons are resistant to virus-mediated cell death and provide a framework for studying the effects of prior coronavirus infection on neuron function.IMPORTANCE We developed a novel recombinant virus that allows the study of cells that survive an infection by a central nervous system-specific strain of murine coronavirus.

We believe these 4 steps will be critical to initiating SUD treatment for many persons that have yet to receive it, and for preserving SUD treatment continuity for millions of other patients both during and after the pandemic.","output":"Policies to Improve Substance Use Disorder Treatment With Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As influenza season was approaching in 2020, public health officials feared that influenza would worsen the COVID-19 situation [...].","output":"Fear of Influenza Resurgence amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Need for Effective Flu Vaccine Still Exists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, antecedents and consequences of conspiracy beliefs are investigated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. 618 individuals residing in different geographical area of Italy participated in the study.

We tested associations in 3067 children using a linear mixed model and confirmed the results with meta-analysis of identified SNPs. With a stringent Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons we obtained significant associations(p < 1.4  10-4) for 5 SNPs, which were in high LD (r2 > 0.85) in the 16q12.2 non-coding intronic chromosomal region of FTO gene with strongest association observed for rs8050136 (effect size() = 0.31, pWald = 1.52  10-5).

However, the relationship between serum netrin-1 level and the risk of ischemic stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between netrin-1 level and risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control study including 591 ischemic stroke patients and 591 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals was conducted, and serum netrin-1 concentrations were quantitatively determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for all participants. The serum netrin-1 levels were significantly lower in the ischemic stroke patients than those in matched controls (median, 496.4 vs 652.1 pg/mL; P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke associated with the highest quartile of netrin-1 was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01-0.65; Ptrend = 0.018) compared with the lowest quartile of netrin-1. Each 1-standard deviation increase of log-transformed netrin-1 was associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke (odds ratio: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.94; P = 0.032), and a dose-response relationship between serum netrin-1 and ischemic stroke was observed (Plinearity = 0.003).

FINDINGS: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70  6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = -0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (r = -0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = -0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (r = -0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (r = -0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = -0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = - 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642).

METHODS Data were collected from 258 centres in 18 countries. The number of MPS studies per million population (pmp) was estimated assuming that the nonresponding centres performed either no studies (lower estimate) or the same number as the responding centres (upper estimate). RESULTS The responding centres served 24% of the population of their countries. The total number of noncardiac nuclear medicine studies was between 2,160 and 8,000 studies pmp. The total number of MPS studies was between 529 and 2,293 pmp. The median number of MPS studies per centre was 571 per year with 57% performing fewer than 500 studies per year and 23% of centres performing fewer than 250 studies per year. There was significant variation between countries, with higher numbers of MPS studies (lower limit of estimate above the mid-range of all countries combined) in Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Portugal and Slovenia, and lower numbers (upper limit of estimate below the mid-range of all countries) in Finland, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. The ratio of MPS to coronary angiography to revascularization procedures was 0.9 to 2.2 to 1. Pharmacological stress was used in 57% and technetium-99m-labelled tracers in 88% of studies. ECG gating was performed in 74% of studies and attenuation correction in 22%. CONCLUSION MPS utilization in Europe remains low compared with coronary angiography although there has been a 21% increase in the number of studies pmp in centres that reported in both 2005 and 2007. Pharmacological agents continue to be the predominant form of stress. Despite the widespread use of technetium-99m-labelled tracers, ECG gating is not universally performed.

Todays telemedicine options relate not only to the area of diagnostics, but also to the monitoring of therapy courses and rehabilitation measures. Due to the current resource constraints, many orthopedic surgeons and trauma surgeons have been forced to set up video consultations, although standards for orthopedic video consultations have so far been insufficiently developed. In order to maximize the efficiency of virtual orthopedics, patients should be prepared for the virtual visit (checklist with specific instructions on camera positioning, body positioning, adjustment and clothing, testing of audiovisual skills). Classic diagnostic measures such as anamnesis, inspection and assessment of radiological findings are possible in the video consultation. One major disadvantage is, that there is no possibility for a functional examination (stability of the knee joint, shoulder tests). Although initial controlled scientific studies have shown that telemedical diagnostics are not inferior to conventional diagnostics, there are still no validated examination protocols and methods. Postoperative monitoring of rehabilitation measures can, for example, be made easier by the use of sensors. With modern sensors, inexpensive detection of joint mobility and joint position is now possible and is already used in the area of rehabilitation after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Here too, further research is certainly necessary to validate these methods.

Here, we describe and summarize attributes of the identified AI techniques and datasets used for their implementation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). Electronic databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, and IEEE Xplore) were searched between 1st April 2020 and 1st August 2021. Terms were selected based on the target intervention (i.e. AI), the target disease (i.e., COVID-19) and acoustic correlates of the disease (i.e. speech, breathing and cough). A narrative approach was used to summarize the extracted data. Results: 21 studies and 8 Apps out of the 83 retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria. Half of the publications and Apps were from the USA. The most prominent AI architecture used was a convolutional neural network, followed by a recurrent neural network. AI models were mainly trained, tested and run on websites and personal computers, rather than on phone apps.

RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were identified and reviewed by the author. The prevalence of burnout reported varied widely between studies, ranging from 10% to 62%. Many of the factors that contribute to burnout form part of the educational environment, for example, hours worked, mistreatment, harassment and perceptions of injustice. Residency itself is a stressful period wherein trainees have to balance their responsibilities towards their patients with their responsibilities at home, all while furthering their studies and taking on new responsibilities.

Methods: A systematic review of nine databases was conducted and studies that were published in a peer-review journal, in English, that included at least one assessment of ANS function in individuals with a current or previous diagnosis of AN were selected. Forty-six studies were included with a total of 811 participants with a current diagnosis of AN and 123 participants with a previous diagnosis of AN.

Individuals with AN demonstrated increased parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity, suggestive of autonomic dysregulation. Following weight restoration, autonomic function trended toward, or was equivalent to, control levels. Discussion: Autonomic dysregulation is indicated through a range of assessments in individuals with AN. Future investigations should utilize a variety of assessments together in order to conclusively establish the nature of autonomic dysfunction in AN, and following extended weight restoration.

In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-ORF3-RFP. icPEDV-ORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-ORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting.","output":"Characterization of a Pathogenic Full-Length cDNA Clone and Transmission Model for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain PC22A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: Many prominent people have advocated that the IMF [International Monetary Fund] undertake an 'SDR [Special Drawing Rights] allocation' to assist countries in dealing with the global financial crisis brought about by the COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic To most experts, the idea seems like a no-brainer, but some IMF shareholders have voiced concerns, particularly the United States, which has a controlling vote in the matter If IMF shareholders show some leadership and bureaucratic flexibility, there are ways to allay the American government's concerns and quickly get liquidity in the hands of countries who desperately need it Special drawing rights;International Monetary Fund;COVID-19 (Disease);Economic assistance","output":"Making the IMF's Special Drawing Rights Work for COVID-19 Economic Relief"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into a crisis.

The uncertainty in the model input parameters was included via uncertainty analysis, while global sensitivity analysis was used to assign the uncertainty in the model output to the different sources of uncertainty in the model input. The model was verified, and the prediction interval corresponded to the vial temperature profiles obtained from experimental data, within the limits of the uncertainty interval. The uncertainty in the model prediction was mainly explained (>96% of uncertainty) by the uncertainty in the heat transfer coefficient, the gas temperature measurement, and the equilibrium temperature. The developed model was also applied in order to set and control a desired vial temperature profile during spin freezing. Applying this model in-line to a continuous freeze-drying process may alleviate some of the disadvantages related to batch freeze-drying, where control over the freezing step is generally poor.","output":"Development and Application of a Mechanistic Cooling and Freezing Model of the Spin Freezing Step within the Framework of Continuous Freeze-Drying"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 are important to protect against infection and/or disease.

Despite an incidence rate of 0.02% in the vaccine arm of the Moderna mRNA-1273 trial, concerns have been expressed about the association of adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections and the COVID-19 vaccines. The International Society for Dermatologic and Aesthetic Surgery (ISDS) understands these concerns and has designed the following study. METHODS: A global survey was designed to capture the incidence of adverse events related to: (1) previous soft tissue filler injections, (2) soft tissue filler injections during positive testing for COVID-19, and (3) soft tissue filler injections during and after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines globally available. RESULTS: The information of 106 survey participants from 18 different countries was analyzed. 80.2% (n=85) never experienced any adverse reaction following their soft tissue filler injection whereas 15.1% (n=16) experienced swelling and 4.7% (n=5) experienced pain that lasted longer than two days. Of those who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (n=78), 94.9% reported not to have experienced any adverse reaction related to their previous soft tissue filler injection, whereas 5.1% (n=4) reported to have perceived pain that lasted longer than two days. CONCLUSION: The data collected does not support the concern for an increased risk of developing adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections associated with the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that risk associated with other previously described triggers or the default risk following soft tissue filler injections.

During T-cell activation, the immune system uses different checkpoint pathways to maintain co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory signals. In COVID-19, expression of immune checkpoints (ICs) is one of the most important manifestations, in addition to lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokines, contributing to worse clinical outcomes. There is a controversy whether upregulation of ICs in COVID-19 patients might lead to T-cell exhaustion or activation. This review summarizes the available studies that investigated IC receptors and ligands in COVID-19 patients, as well as their effect on T-cell function. Several IC receptors and ligands, including CTLA-4, BTLA, TIM-3, VISTA, LAG-3, TIGIT, PD-1, CD160, 2B4, NKG2A, Galectin-9, Galectin-3, PD-L1, PD-L2, LSECtin, and CD112, were upregulated in COVID-19 patients. Based on the available studies, there is a possible relationship between disease severity and increased expression of IC receptors and ligands. Overall, the upregulation of some ICs could be used as a prognostic biomarker for disease severity.","output":"Inhibitory Immune Checkpoint Receptors and Ligands as Prognostic Biomarkers in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening.

However, substrate specificity is derived from the chemical properties of the residues, which implies that perturbations of the solution environment may cause changes in the fidelity of the reaction. Here, we investigated non-promoter-based synthesis of RNA using T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) directed by an RNA template in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various molecular weights, which can affect polymerization fidelity by altering the solution properties. We found that the mismatch extensions of RNA propagated downstream polymerization. Furthermore, PEG promoted the polymerization of non-complementary ribonucleoside triphosphates, mainly due to the decrease in the dielectric constant of the solution. These results indicate that the mismatch extension of RNA-dependent RNA polymerization by T7 RNAP is driven by the stacking interaction of bases of the primer end and the incorporated nucleotide triphosphates (NTP) rather than base pairing between them. Thus, proteinaceous RNA polymerase may display different substrate specificity with changes in dielectricity caused by molecular crowding conditions, which can result in increased genetic diversity without proteinaceous modification.","output":"Dielectricity of a molecularly crowded solution accelerates NTP misincorporation during RNA-dependent RNA polymerization by T7 RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted first-line medical staff as well as nursing-student clinical practicum programs How to cooperate with the government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education and clinical practice represent significant challenges In this paper, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario exercises The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals After implementation of these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for the on-campus clinical practicum than for the offcampus clinical practicum Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and commented positively on their experience For example, the students indicated that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning outcomes The adjusted nursing clinical practicum described in this paper may be used as a reference to ensure the quality of nursing clinical practicum programs is maintained during epidemics","output":"Challenges to the Nursing Practicum During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Bacterial co-pathogens are common in various viral respiratory tract infections, leading to increased disease severity and mortality.

Material and methods: During the six-month study period, clinical samples (blood samples, respiratory samples, and sterile body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) of COVID-19 patients with suspected bacterial coinfections (at presentation) or secondary infections (after 48 hours of hospitalization) were received and processed for the same. Results: Clinical samples of 814 COVID-19 patients were received for bacterial culture and susceptibility. Out of the total patient sample, 75% had already received empirical antibiotics before the samples were sent for analysis. Overall, 17.9% of cultures were positive for bacterial infections. Out of the total patients with bacterial infection, 74% (108/146) of patients had secondary bacterial infections (after 48 hours of hospitalization) and 26% (38/146) had bacterial coinfections (at the time of admission).

This study not only investigates and explores the interaction between three types of medicine (Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, and Remdesivir), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptors but also comparing the results with the interaction between the active part of the virus (Spike protein (S1)) and the cell. All interactions and properties of all molecules have been studied theoretically using theoretical calculations and computational methods based on the density functional theory. The results indicate that one of the drugs, which is Remdesivir could be an effective barrier inhibits the bind of the S1 with the human cell. This result could be interpreted in terms of the binding energy, since the binding energy of the Remdesivir molecule with the ACE2 equals-8.564 eV, while the binding energy of S1 is-5.666 eV. This research also founds that the electrons transfer from the drug to the ACE2 is 10.873 e, which is higher than that of S1 (5.155e). In addition, the results exhibit the Hydroxychloroquine does not have enough capability to inhibit the binding process between the virus and the cell since its binding energy (-2.948 eV) and the number of electrons transfer (0.7670) are the lowest. Finally, the Fermi energies values of Remdesivir (-3.5 eV) and ACE2 (-3.4 eV) molecules are convergent. In the context of the elastic transport, this predication is an important result since it interprets the large number of electrons that have been transferred from Remdesivir to ACE2 molecule, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, and this introduces the Remdesivir as a promising drug.","output":"The promising barrier: Theoretical investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Changes in autonomic nervous system function, characterized by heart rate variability (HRV), have been associated with infection and observed prior to its clinical identification.

METHODS: Health care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app, which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study, measuring HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys assessing infection and symptom-related questions were obtained daily. RESULTS: Using a mixed-effect cosinor model, the mean amplitude of the circadian pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (P=.006). The mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during uninfected time periods (P=.01). Significant changes in the mean and amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of reporting a COVID-19Crelated symptom compared to all other symptom-free days (P=.01).

The true frequency and underlying mechanisms of neurological injury are unknown, but exaggerated host inflammatory responses appear to be a key driver of severe COVID-19 more broadly. We sought to investigate the dynamics of, and relationship between, serum markers of brain injury (neurofilament light [NfL], Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein [GFAP] and total Tau) and markers of dysregulated host response including measures of autoinflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) and autoimmunity. Brain injury biomarkers were measured using the Quanterix Simoa HDx platform, cytokine profiling by Luminex (R&D) and autoantibodies by a custom protein microarray. During hospitalisation, patients with COVID-19 demonstrated elevations of NfL and GFAP in a severity-dependant manner, and there was evidence of ongoing active brain injury at follow-up 4 months later. Raised NfL and GFAP were associated with both elevations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of autoantibodies; autoantibodies were commonly seen against lung surfactant proteins as well as brain proteins such as myelin associated glycoprotein, but reactivity was seen to a large number of different antigens. Furthermore, a distinct process characterised by elevation of serum total Tau was seen in patients at follow-up, which appeared to be independent of initial disease severity and was not associated with dysregulated immune responses in the same manner as NfL and GFAP.","output":"Brain Injury in COVID-19 is Associated with Autoinflammation and Autoimmunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSeveral studies report substantial decreases in the volume of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during the early stage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Differences in characteristics of strokes such as increasing rates of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke were also observed comparing between pre-COVID and COVID eras. However, these findings were often based on data from selected hospitals or networks and estimates may be biased by level of stroke care and baseline case mix. A population-based study including rural hospitals and non-stroke centers covering a longer observation period beyond the early-pandemic epoch may lead to more accurate insights.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective population-based study using the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File, capturing all discharges from hospitals in the State of Texas excluding federal hospitals. We assessed quarterly changes in volume, characteristics, care of AIS, and patient outcomes from April 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 and compared two time periods. 2020Q2 was defined as the pandemic period and the previous one year as the pre-pandemic period. Cases were defined as inpatient hospitalizations to acute care hospitals with a primary diagnosis of AIS. ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify AIS, LVO, use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) and endovascular treatment (EVT). Hospitals were determined as CSC (Comprehensive Stroke Center) and non-CSC based on designation by the Texas Department of State Health Services.ResultsThe number of AIS cases dropped substantially from 10,745 per quarter in the pre-pandemic period to 9,277 in the pandemic period (-14%) in Texas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS At a single institution, during protected education conference, residents played an hour-long surgical jeopardy game every 7 wk to summarize high yield topics discussed during the previous 6 wk of didactic learning. A 5-point Likert survey was completed by general surgery residents to discern the utility of the game format for learning.

The developed reagent kits provided 100% sensitivity and a detection limit of 103 GE / ml for qPCR, and at least 200 copies / ml of viral RNA when performing digital PCR. These methods were tested using a panel of 1,328 samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in the Russian Federation.

The aim of this review is to describe the spectrum of definitions and methods employed in the measurement of unique outcomes across PD access trials particularly focusing on the outcomes of PD access flow restriction and operative-related outcomes. METHODS Using Cochrane CENTRAL registry, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, we searched for studies restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions related to PD access without restrictions on age, language, or publication year. Studies were screened and data abstracted by two independent reviewers. Definitions, outcome measures, and time points of measurements were captured and documented separately. Unique combinations of these variables resulted in reporting the different ways of measurements. RESULTS Of the 1768 screened studies, 47 RCTs were included among which 817 PD access outcomes were grouped into 7 broad categories. Interventions evaluated in the RCTs were catheter type/configuration (n = 17), insertion technique (n = 15), multiple interventions (n = 3), and other (6 interventions, n = 12). PD access flow restriction (a subcategory of mechanical outcomes) and operative-related outcomes were reported in 91% and 58% of the included trials, respectively. Tip migration was the most frequently reported flow restriction outcome (59% of RCTs) followed by catheter dysfunction (23% of RCTs). Of the components utilized in definition of flow restriction, description of the impaired flow was reported in 37% of RCTs, need for intervention in 42% of RCTs, and presumed etiology of flow restriction in 60% of RCTs. CONCLUSION Variability exists in the definitions, reporting methods, choice of outcomes, and analysis of the PD access outcomes across RCTs. Operative-related outcomes remain underreported across RCTs. Outcomes relating to PD access flow restriction were the most common complications reported in the included RCTs but were reported heterogeneously with variability in reporting of the three key components of its definition including description and severity of the flow restriction, the need for intervention and etiology of flow restriction. In the future, defining PD access flow restriction should include all of these components to better evaluate the comparative effect of various PD access interventions.","output":"Peritoneal dialysis access outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microtubule-associated protein Tau can form protein aggregates transmissible within the brain, correlating with the progression of tauopathies in humans.

Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007C2011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including -CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of -, -, -, and -CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the -CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for -CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one -CoV and two -CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.","output":"Development of a one-step RT-PCR assay for detection of pancoronaviruses (-, -, -, and -coronaviruses) using newly designed degenerate primers for porcine and avian \`fecal samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PA28 (also known as 11S, REG or PSME) is a family of proteasome regulators whose members are widely present in many of the eukaryotic supergroups. In jawed vertebrates they are represented by three paralogs, PA28, PA28, and PA28, which assemble as heptameric hetero (PA28) or homo (PA28) rings on one or both extremities of the 20S proteasome cylindrical structure. While they share high sequence and structural similarities, the three isoforms significantly differ in terms of their biochemical and biological properties. In fact, PA28 and PA28 seem to have appeared more recently and to have evolved very rapidly to perform new functions that are specifically aimed at optimizing the process of MHC class I antigen presentation. In line with this, PA28 favors release of peptide products by proteasomes and is particularly suited to support adaptive immune responses without, however, affecting hydrolysis rates of protein substrates. On the contrary, PA28 seems to be a slow-evolving gene that is most similar to the common ancestor of the PA28 activators family, and very likely retains its original functions. Notably, PA28 has a prevalent nuclear localization and is involved in the regulation of several essential cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, chromatin structure and organization, and response to DNA damage. In striking contrast with the activity of PA28, most of these diverse biological functions of PA28 seem to depend on its ability to markedly enhance degradation rates of regulatory protein by 20S proteasome. The present review will focus on the molecular mechanisms and biochemical properties of PA28, which are likely to account for its various and complex biological functions and highlight the common features with the PA28 paralog.","output":"PA28: New Insights on an Ancient Proteasome Activator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Double-page spread detailed information on pollination, safety and etiquette (how to not get stung), and the identification of species of wasps and bees bookend the centerpiece, a lyrical, humorous tribute to boys and bees By sharing this delightful story of a young boy who, when his babysitter is unable to work, must go to work with his parents, night janitors in high-rise office buildings At first Daniel, sleepy-eyed and ready for bed under the watchful eye of Aunt Clara, just wants to stay home, but given no choice, he soon discovers the exciting world of deserted night time offices as his parents lovingly provide him with imaginative play in this tribute to our urban so-essential workers","output":"Bibliotherapeutic Picture Books for Uncertain Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Using case vignettes, we highlight challenges in communication, prognostication, and medical decision-making that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic for patients with kidney disease.

RECENT FINDINGS: Certain biomarkers, demographics, and medical comorbidities predict an increased risk for mortality among patients with COVID-19 and kidney disease, but concerns related to physical exposure and conservation of personal protective equipment have exacerbated existing barriers to empathic communication and value clarification for these patients. Variability in patient characteristics and outcomes has made prognostication nuanced and challenging.

In this study, we characterized bacterial microbiomes associated with RIFA nest soils and native (RIFA-negative) soils to better understand the effects of colonization of RIFA on soil microbial communities. Bacterial community fingerprints of 16S rRNA amplicons using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the structure of the bacterial communities between RIFA-positive and RIFA-negative soils at 0 and 10 cm depths. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons provided fine-scale analysis to test for effects of RIFA colonization, RIFA social form, and soil depth on the composition of the bacterial microbiomes of the soil and RIFA workers. Our results showed the bacterial community structure of RIFA-colonized soils to be significantly different from native soil communities and to evidence elevated abundances of several taxa, including Actinobacteria. Colony social form was not found to be a significant factor in nest or RIFA worker microbiome compositions. RIFA workers and nest soils were determined to have markedly different bacterial communities, with RIFA worker microbiomes being characterized by high abundances of a Bartonella-like endosymbiont and Entomoplasmataceae.

These isolations quickly made it possible to carry out the first tests for antiviral agents' susceptibility and drug repurposing. However, it seems important to make an inventory of all the cells that can support the growth of this virus and evaluate possible differences between isolates. In the present work, we tested 4 strains of SARS-CoV-2 locally isolated on a panel of 34 cell lines present in our laboratory and commonly used for the isolation of human pathogenic microorganism. After inoculation, cells were observed for cytopathic effects and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction was used to measure the virus replication on the cells. We were able to obtain growth on 7 cell lines, 6 simian, and the human Caco-2. The cytopathogenic effects are variable, ranging from lysis of the cell monolayer in 48-72 h to no cytopathic effect in spite of intense multiplication, as in Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, effect and multiplication varied widely according to the strain tested. In this paper, we explored the species specificity and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro on a panel of cells available in our laboratory and identified human and animal cell lines susceptible to support SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The objective of this study is to assess both the psychological and social impact of that lockdown on different age groups of children and adolescents and also the different strategies adopted by families in that situation. We collected data via an online questionnaire answered by 850 participants, parents of young people aged between 4 and 18, between 24th April and 8th May 2020. Our results show that living in a home smaller than 80 m(2) is associated with an increased risk of presenting clinical symptoms of emotional or behavioural distress, with an odds ratio of 2.54 (95% CI: 1.07C6.02), p = 0.034; while increased age is a predictor of better psychological functioning during lockdown: coefficient of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.07C0.41), p = 0.004. Moreover, age is also a marker of higher scores on the scale of psychological symptoms, with a coefficient of 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01C0.04), p = .005. To conclude, younger children present poorer behavioural and emotional functioning and more symptoms of emotional distress than adolescents during lockdown. Living in a small home is a risk factor for presenting clinical symptoms.

In this Original Research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analysed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6% and 99.5% respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the assay was found at Ct<22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 minutes.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prescription of a benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI. For each month, the percentage of patients with benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI prescriptions by sex was calculated. RESULTS: The records of 17 255 033 adults (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [19.5] years; 51.3% female) were examined in 2018, 17 340 731 adults (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [19.7] years; 51.6% female) in 2019, 16 916 910 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.7 [19.8] years; 51.9% female) in 2020, and 15 135 998 adults (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [19.8] years; 52.5% female) in 2021. Compared with men, women had a higher rate of prescriptions for all 3 drugs classes and had larger changes in prescription rates over time. Benzodiazepine prescribing decreased from January 2018 (women: 5.61%; 95% CI, 5.60%-5.63%; men: 3.03%; 95% CI, 3.02%-3.04%) to March 2021 (women: 4.91%; 95% CI, 4.90%-4.93%; men: 2.66%; 95% CI, 2.65%-2.67%), except for a slight increase in April 2020 among women. Z-hypnotic prescribing increased from January 2020 for women (1.39%; 95% CI, 1.38%-1.40%) and February 2020 for men (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.96%-0.98%) to October 2020 (women: 1.46%; 95% CI, 1.46%-1.47%; men: 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.99%-1.01%).

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the proportion of RVs and their impact on the outcome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the intensive care unit (ICU). STUDY DESIGN: Cases of HAP were retrospectively selected among patients who underwent screening for RVs by multiplex PCR (mPCR) in the ICU of a French tertiary care hospital from May 2014 to April 2016. ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared between four groups defined according to the identified pathogens: virus only (V), virus/bacteria (V/B), bacteria only (B) and no pathogen (Neg). When available, previous mPCR was retrieved in order to assess possible chronic viral carriage. RESULTS: Overall, 95/999 (10%) ICU patients who underwent mPCR had HAP (V(17,18%), V/B(13,14%), B(60,63%), Neg(5,5%)). Median age was 61 years and 45 (47%) were immunocompromised. Influenza (27%) and rhinovirus (27%) were the most common RVs. V/B group had higher mortality rate than B and V groups (62% vs. 40% and 35%, p = 0.3) and a significantly longer length of stay (31 days (18C48)) than V group (5 days (3C11), p = 0.0002)) and B group (14.5 days (5.5C25.5), p = 0.007)). Among the 15 patients with available mPCR tests before viral HAP, seven were negative and eight were positive corresponding to long-term carriage of community-acquired viruses. DISCUSSION: RVs were detected in 32% of HAP patients who underwent mPCR. Two situations were encountered: (i) acute acquired viral infection; (ii) long-term viral carriage (mostly rhinovirus) especially in immunocompromised patients complicated by a virus/bacteria coinfection.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the PROTECT clinical study is an Italian interventional superiority study, open label, with cluster randomization, aimed at evaluating whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in a population of subjects exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus consisting of cohabitants/contacts of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients and the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Protect study from May to September 2020. RESULTS from May to September 2020, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the PROTECT clinical trial showed a decrease consistent with the number of news on hydroxychloroquine appearing in the national and local press, starting from the time when the first criticisms of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine were made known; the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients showed a more marked and more timely decrease. CONCLUSIONS in the context determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting a controlled clinical trial is strongly influenced by public opinion on scientific issues. Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems. It is preferable to use a sequential or adaptive design. Furthermore, study protocols should implement innovative approaches that also include the involvement of participants in the decision-making process. In any case, the influence of public information on scientific issues is an extremely important factor to consider in the design of clinical trials in exceptional situations such as a pandemic.","output":"Is it possible to conduct clinical trials during a pandemic?

Introduction In 2005 a new respiratory virus, called human bocavirus (HBoV), was cloned from respiratory samples from Swedish infants and children with lower respiratory tract infections. Objectives To determine whether HBoV has circulated in Spain, estimate the frequency of HBoV infections in patients hospitalized for respiratory infection and describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients. Patients and methods We performed a descriptive prospective study of confirmed HBoV infections in patients aged < 14 years old, hospitalized for respiratory infections between October 2004 and June 2005. Virologic diagnosis was based on multiple RT-PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza A,B, and C, parainfluenza 1-4, adenovirus and rhinovirus; PCR was used for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates was used for HBoV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases of HBoV infection were detected, representing 17.1 % (95 % CI: 13 % a 21 %) of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections. HBoV was the third most frequent viral agent after RSV (30 %) and rhinovirus (25 %). In 39 patients (71.1 %) coinfection with another respiratory virus was detected. Fifty percent of the patients were aged less than 13.6 months and 75 % were aged less than 2 years. The most frequent diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.8 %), bronchiolitis (21.2 %) and pneumonia (15.4 %). Clinical sepsis with petechial exanthema was found in two patients. Fever > 38 C was found in 72.1 % and radiological infiltrate in 44 %. Hypoxia was present in 55.8 % of the patients. HBoV was isolated in distinct episodes in two patients. Coinfections were similar to simple infections except that hypoxia was more frequent in the former (p 0.038). Conclusions HBoV is one of the most frequent viruses in severe respiratory infections in patients aged less than 14 years old. Only RSV and rhinovirus are more frequent. Coinfections are highly frequent. Most patients are infants with recurrent wheezing and bronchiolitis.","output":"Infecciones por bocavirus humano en ni?os espa?oles: caractersticas clnicas y epidemiolgicas de un virus respiratorio emergente"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated rigorous evaluation of public health nutrition programs. The United States Department of Agriculture Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) funds nutrition incentive programs to improve fruit and vegetable purchasing and intake by incentivizing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants at the point of sale. GusNIP grantees are required to collect survey data (e.g., fruit and vegetable intake and food insecurity status) on a subset of participants. However, due to COVID-19, most GusNIP grantees faced formidable barriers to data collection. The Hunger Task Force Mobile Market (HTFMM), a Wisconsin-based 2019 GusNIP grantee, employed particularly innovative methods to successfully collect these data (n > 500 surveys). OBJECTIVE: To explore HTFMM's successful participant-level data collection evaluation during COVID-19. METHODS: A single case study methodological approach framed this study. The case is HTFMM in Milwaukee, WI, USA. Participants included HTFMM: leadership (n = 3), evaluators (n = 2), staff (n = 3), volunteers (n = 3), and customers (n = 10). These teleconference interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded using thematic qualitative analysis methods with two independent coders. RESULTS: Four salient themes emerged. 1) There were multiple key players with unique roles and responsibilities who contributed to personalized, proactive, and time-intensive telephone-based proctored survey collection methods; 2) the importance of resources dedicated to comprehensive evaluation; 3) longstanding relationships rooted in trust and community-based service are key to successful program delivery, engagement, and evaluation; 4) the COVID-19 data collection protocol also serves to mitigate non-pandemic challenges to in-person survey collection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide guidance on how alternative methods for data collection during COVID-19 can be employed and applied to other situations which may affect the ability to collect participant-level data. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature as to best practices and approaches to collecting participant-level data to evaluate public health nutrition programs.","output":"Successful Community Nutrition Incentive Program Data Collection During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There are few if any well-known approaches to reducing avoidable health care utilization and costs in patients with social needs. This study's objective was to explore the goals, and approaches to organizing and delivering care, of interventions attempting to reduce avoidable resource use by addressing patients' medical and social needs. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with study investigators about early interventions in the peer-reviewed literature. A template analysis approach was used to review interview transcripts for common themes and create a final code list. Coder dyads separately coded each interview and resolved any discrepancies. Results: Interviews were conducted with 15 investigators of interventions that delivered a variety of health services and addressed several individual social needs. Participants frequently described their overall goal as meeting patients' diverse needs to prevent unnecessary acute care utilization. Reported approaches to addressing medical needs included assistance with receipt of primary care and care coordination across settings. Social needs were described as tightly linked with medical needs; addressing social support and housing were perceived as distinct from addressing other social needs. Participants described their overall approach to meeting patients' needs in terms of establishing connections, partnership, respect, and being adaptable to patients' priorities. Conclusions: Findings shed new light on how to simultaneously address medical and social needs. Opportunities for future research include evaluating different approaches to addressing medical needs (primary care versus care coordination), separately evaluating the impacts of housing or social support, and hiring and training procedures to promote trauma-informed, patient-centered care.","output":"Addressing medical and social needs to reduce unnecessary health care utilization and costs: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has catapulted the world into a marked health crisis, with over 29 million cases and >930,000 deaths.

This study aimed to enrich the literature by critically analyzing the clinical and biological characteristics of 134 patients from the North African Mediterranean region, including numerous genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that may influence disease evolution. This single-center retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years confirmed to have COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Cheikh Khalifa University Hospital affiliated with Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco. Clinical, demographic, and biological data were analyzed in a cohort of severe and non-severe patients. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of severity. There were 134 patients: the median age was 53 years, and 54.5% were male. Of these, 89 had mild to moderate disease; 45 had severe to critical disease, of which 14 died and 31 survived. Advanced age, presence of comorbidities, male sex, and infection in ethnic or family groups were risk factors for progression to severe disease. The presence of abnormalities in the following parameters were strongly associated with progression to severe disease: white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during both admission and hospitalization.

The ORF2p proteins are relatively well studied and are known to contain endonuclease/reverse transcriptase domains. At the same time, the biological function of ORF1p proteins remains poorly understood, except in that they nonspecifically bind single-stranded mRNA/DNA molecules. CR1-like elements form the most widely distributed clade/superfamily of non-LTR retrotransposons. We found that ORF1p proteins encoded by diverse CR1-like elements contain conserved esterase domain (ES) or plant homeodomain (PHD). This indicates that CR1-like ORF1p proteins are either lipolytic enzymes or are involved in protein-protein interactions related to chromatin remodeling. Sequence conservation of ES suggests that interaction with cellular membranes is an important phase in life circles of CR1-like elements. Presumably such interaction helps in penetrating host cells. As a consequence, the presence of multiple young CR1 families characterized by 10% intrafamily and 40% interfamily identities may be explained by a relatively frequent horizontal transfer of these CR1-like elements.

Very few studies have explored seroprevalence in municipal workers, an important and potentially high-risk population. This study aims to determine the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in municipal workers, with the additional examination of the association of prevalence with various demographic, health-related, and epidemiological factors. Methods: We surveyed and tested for seroprevalence 418 public servants from the municipality of Prishtina, the capital of Kosovo. The primary prespecified outcome was the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, IgG, and IgM. Additional outcomes were crude and adjusted odds ratios of seroprevalence by different factors. Results: 21.1% of municipal workers tested positive for either IgM or IgG. Of these, 9.6% were positive for IgM and 19.4% for IgG. Data showed high levels of adherence to protective measures, e.g., social distancing in the office, but calculation of ORs did not show a significant difference between those reporting adherence to such measures and those reporting nonadherence. Of other examined factors, significantly lower odds were observed for smokers (0.52, 95% CI 0.28, 0.97), while municipal workers with infected family members had elevated odds of seropositivity according to both crude (2.19, 95% CI 1.34, 3.59) and adjusted (2.00, 95% CI 1.17, 3.41) ORs. Conclusions: Most answers from public servants demonstrated compliance to social-distancing policies in the workplace, but analysis of crude and adjusted odds ratios did not suggest a significant effect between municipal workers who followed these guidelines and those who did not. Results from this study help Kosovo policy makers in understanding the level of prevalence of COVID-19 in municipal workers and the effect of different factors on such prevalence.

Then, the WHOs main recommendations to prevent severe clinical complications by COVID-19 are still essentially based on social distancing and limitation of human interactions, therefore the identification of new target-based drugs became a priority. Several strategies have been proposed to counteract such viral infection, including the repurposing of FDA already approved for the treatment of HIV, HCV, and EBOLA, inter alia. Among the evaluated compounds, inhibitors of the main protease of the coronavirus (M(pro)) are becoming more and more promising candidates.

We not only did not observe a decline in pediatric IBD secondary to absent viral illness but noted a statistically significant increase in Crohns Disease approximately 6 months after the initial 2020 COVID wave in NYC, and trends suggesting increases overall in IBD diagnoses above the existing trend towards increased disease presentation that pre-dated the pandemic. This data suggests that there may be a linkage between SARS-nCoV2 infection rates and subsequent pediatric IBD presentation, warranting further evaluation in the aftermath of the Omicron wave.","output":"Epidemiologic Assessment of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Presentation in NYC During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) operate within a rigid set of clinical guidelines and regulations that specify the number of required OTP visits for supervised administration of methadone. To ensure physical distancing in light of COVID-19, the federal government loosened regulations to allow for additional flexibility. As OTP providers in the Bronx, NY, caring for more than 3600 patients in the epicenter of both the overdose and COVID-19 pandemics, we describe how our clinical practice changed with COVID-19. We halted toxicology testing, and to promote physical distancing and prevent interruptions in access to treatment for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), we drastically increased unsupervised take-home doses of MOUD. Within two weeks, we reduced the proportion of patients with 5-6 OTP visits per week from 47.2% to 9.4%. To guide treatment decision-making, we shifted focus from toxicology tests to other patient-centered measures, such as engagement in care and patient goals. In the initial three months, our patients experienced six nonfatal overdoses, no fatal overdoses, and 20 deaths attributable to COVID-19. This experience provides an opportunity to re-imagine care in OTPs going forward. We advocate that OTPs rely less on toxicology testing and more on the other patient-centered measures to guide decisions about distribution of take-home doses of MOUD. To minimize financial risk to OTPs and facilitate their transition to a more flexible model of care, we advocate for the reassessment of OTP reimbursement models.","output":"Reimagining patient-centered care in opioid treatment programs: Lessons from the Bronx during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the efficacy of teacher written feedback has been widely investigated, relatively few studies have been conducted from feedback practitioners' perspectives to investigate teachers' beliefs regarding it, particularly compare beliefs held by teachers with different sociocultural and linguistic backgrounds.

In this study, we examined how the experimental situations (laboratory/online) affected group cooperation and individual performances. The participants were Japanese university students, randomly assigned to laboratory or online experiments. For the group cooperation task, they were asked to perform the public goods game with or without punishment, but no effect of the experimental situation was found both for cooperative and punitive behaviors. For the individual tasks, participants were asked to perform tasks including a creative task and a dull task. We manipulated the presence or absence of an external incentive. As a result, there was no significant difference between the experimental situations with one exception: only in the laboratory situation was the performance of the difficult creative task lower in the presence of an external incentive. Furthermore, we conducted as an additional experiment using the same treatments for a Japanese online-worker sample. This sample was less cooperative in the public goods game than the student sample, both with and without punishment. In addition, the presence of external incentives facilitated performance of the online-worker sample only for the dull task.

Compounding this threat is the near certainty that novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential will emerge in years to come. Pan-coronavirus drugsagents active against both SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruseswould address both threats. A strategy to develop such broad-spectrum inhibitors is to pharmacologically target binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly conserved in other known coronaviruses, the assumption being that any selective pressure to keep a site conserved across past viruses will apply to future ones. Here we systematically mapped druggable binding pockets on the experimental structure of 15 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and analyzed their variation across 27 - and -coronaviruses and across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. We find that the two most conserved druggable sites are a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13 and the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, both components of the viral replicationCtranscription complex.

At the molecular level, the hormonal form of vitamin D signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed throughout the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The advent of genome-wide approaches to gene expression profiling have led to the identification of numerous VDR-regulated genes implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. The molecular data infer that vitamin D signaling should boost innate immunity against pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. Vitamin D signaling also suppresses inflammatory immune responses that underlie autoimmunity and regulate allergic responses. These findings have been bolstered by clinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmunity, and allergies. Our goals here are to provide an overview of the molecular basis for immune system regulation and to survey the clinical data from pediatric populations, using randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses where possible, linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmune conditions, and allergies, and addressing the impact of supplementation on these conditions.","output":"Vitamin D and Immunity in Infants and Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of official clinical trial information, data from social networks can be used by public health and medical researchers to assess public claims about loosely regulated substances such as cannabidiol (CBD). For example, this can be achieved by comparing the medical conditions targeted by those selling CBD against the medical conditions patients commonly treat with CBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a framework for public health and medical researchers to use for identifying and analyzing the consumption and marketing of unregulated substances. Specifically, we examined CBD, which is a substance that is often presented to the public as medication despite complete evidence of efficacy and safety. METHODS: We collected 567,850 tweets by searching Twitter with the Tweepy Python package using the terms CBD and cannabidiol. We trained two binary text classifiers to create two corpora of 167,755 personal use and 143,322 commercial/sales tweets. Using medical, standard, and slang dictionaries, we identified and compared the most frequently occurring medical conditions, symptoms, side effects, body parts, and other substances referenced in both corpora. In addition, to assess popular claims about the efficacy of CBD as a medical treatment circulating on Twitter, we performed sentiment analysis via the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) model on the personal CBD tweets. RESULTS: We found references to medically relevant terms that were unique to either personal or commercial CBD tweet classes, as well as medically relevant terms that were common to both classes. When we calculated the average sentiment scores for both personal and commercial CBD tweets referencing at least one of 17 medical conditions/symptoms terms, an overall positive sentiment was observed in both personal and commercial CBD tweets. We observed instances of negative sentiment conveyed in personal CBD tweets referencing autism, whereas CBD was also marketed multiple times as a treatment for autism within commercial tweets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed framework provides a tool for public health and medical researchers to analyze the consumption and marketing of unregulated substances on social networks. Our analysis showed that most users of CBD are satisfied with it in regard to the condition that it is being advertised for, with the exception of autism.","output":"Infodemiological Examination of Personal and Commercial Tweets About Cannabidiol: Term and Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT There is a need to understand population race and ethnicity disparities in the context of sociodemographic risk factors in the US experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE Determine the association between county-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) on county COVID-19 case and death rates and observe how this association was influenced by county sociodemographic and health care infrastructure characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING This was an ecologic analysis of US counties as of September 20, 2020, that employed stepwise construction of linear and negative binomial regression models. The primary independent variable was the proportion of NHB population in the county. Covariates included county demographic composition, proportion uninsured, proportion living in crowded households, proportion living in poverty, population density, state testing rate, Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area status, and hospital beds per 1000 population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes were exponentiated COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population. We produced county-level maps of the measures of interest. RESULTS In total, 3044 of 3142 US counties were included. Bivariate relationships between the proportion of NHB in a county and county COVID-19 case (Exp  = 1.026; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.024-1.028; P < .001) and death rates (rate ratio [RR] = 1.032; 95% CI, 1.029-1.035; P < .001) were not attenuated in fully adjusted models. The adjusted association between the proportion of NHB population in a county and county COVID-19 case was Exp  = 1.025 (95% CI, 1.023-1.027; P < .001) and the association with county death rates was RR = 1.034 (95% CI, 1.031-1.038; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of NHB people in a county was positively associated with county COVID-19 case and death rates and did not change in models that accounted for other socioecologic and health care infrastructure characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority populations.

These have contributed and strengthened the thrust towards enhancing professionalism in HRM practices within the Public Service. However, despite these important reforms, several other reforms are required to strike a balance between the exigencies of the Public Service and the improvement of the wellbeing and performance of public officers through telework, work-life balance, family-friendly measures and training. Government is the largest employer in Malta;thus, this balance is difficult to achieve, particularly when considering the reliance that a small island state has on the Public Service. This challenge is further accentuated with the unanticipated circumstances, significantly the crisis of COVID-19 that has highlighted the need to invest more in human resources management and new ways of conducting normal work practices. Programmes intended to promote and foster motivation in Public Service employees are to be particularly emphasized. Motivational systems vary from the performance management programmes that specifically focus on performance appraisal, to robust flexible work-life balance arrangements. The former has seen a radical improvement in the last 6 years, but the latter needs a more solid framework in an era where teleworking and flexibility is dominating the labour market.

Anti-pandemic measures in the Slovak Republic were reflected in a decrease in the mobility of the population in public passenger transport;the change in mobility manifested to different extents in individual regions of the Slovak Republic. Our research at the regional level is focused on the ?ilina self-governing region. The net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was clear through a year-on-year decrease in the number of total passenger transport systems for suburban bus transport (SBT) in ?SK by 40.2% in March, in April by 70.0%, and in May by 60.2%. There was a more significant decrease in the number of passengers in the first wave of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 than during the second wave of the pandemic in the second half of 2020.

In addition to social interventions, a range of digital technology interventions (DTIs) are being used to tackle loneliness. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness, especially in adults. The effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness needs to be systematically assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness in older adults. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science for empirical studies published in English from January 1, 2010, to July 31, 2019. The study selection criteria included interventional studies that used any type of DTIs to reduce loneliness in adults (aged 18 years) with a minimum intervention duration of 3 months and follow-up measurements at least 3 months after the intervention. Two researchers independently screened articles and extracted data using the PICO (participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome) framework. The primary outcome measure was loneliness. Loneliness scores in both the intervention and control groups at baseline and at follow-up at 3, 4, 6, and 12 months after the intervention were extracted. Data were analyzed via narrative synthesis and meta-analysis using RevMan (The Cochrane Collaboration) software. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were selected from 4939 screened articles. These studies included 1 before and after study and 5 clinical trials (4 randomized clinical trials and 1 quasi-experimental study). All of these studies enrolled a total of 646 participants (men: n=154, 23.8%; women: n=427, 66.1%; no gender information: n=65, 10.1%) with an average age of 73-78 years (SD 6-11). Five clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis, and by using the random effects model, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for each trial and pooled across studies at the 3-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups. The overall effect estimates showed no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of DTIs compared with that of usual care or non-DTIs at follow-up at 3 months (SMD 0.02; 95% CI ?0.36 to 0.40; P=.92), 4 months (SMD ?1.11; 95% CI ?2.60 to 0.38; P=.14), and 6 months (SMD ?0.11; 95% CI ?0.54 to 0.32; P=.61).

A systematic database search was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fifty-five papers/reports met eligibility criteria. There were 34 barriers and 21 enablers identified. The leading barriers related to riding on the road alongside motor vehicles. Other factors identified included the provision and quality of cycling infrastructure, personal factors such as physical fitness, attitudinal factors such as community perceptions of cyclists, and environmental factors. While this review highlights the complexity of factors that influence the uptake of riding a bike for transport, many of the leading factors could be overcome through the provision of high-quality protected infrastructure for bike riders. Other interventions to address other known barriers and enablers are needed to increase the uptake of bike riding.","output":"Adults' self-reported barriers and enablers to riding a bike for transport: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Following the first reports in the literature, the association between the ABO blood group and SARS-CoV-2 infection has been investigated by a number of studies, although with varying results. The main object of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between the ABO blood group and the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature search using appropriate MeSH terms was performed through Medline and PubMed. The outcomes considered were the prevalence of the blood group O vs non-O types in SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected subjects, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to ABO group. The methodological quality of the studies included in the analysis was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the overall quality of the available evidence using the GRADE system. Benchmarks used to evaluate the effect size were odd ratios (ORs) for case control studies and risk ratios (RRs) for cohort studies. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. Overall, individuals with group O had a lower infection rate compared to individuals of non-O group (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86). However, the difference in the effect size was significantly lower in cohort studies compared to case control studies. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on the disease severity in the infected patients. DISCUSSION We have found low/very low evidence that group O individuals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those in the non-O group.

Methods and Results: A cohort study was designed from government designated COVID-19 treatment center. CAC was defined as International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score 2. Data from 117 patients COVID-19 were reviewed on admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, vital organ dysfunction, discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission and hospital mortality. Among them, admission to ICU was increased progressively from 16.1% in patients with non-CAC to 42.6% in patients with CAC (P < 0.01). Likely, invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation were increased from 1.8%, 21.4% in patients with non-CAC to 21.3%, 52.5% in patients with CAC, respectively (P < 0.01). The incidences of acute hepatic injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in non-CAC and CAC were 28.6% vs. 62.3%, 8.9% vs. 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission were more in non-CAC than those of CAC (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression results showed that ISTH score 2 was obviously associated with the admission to ICU (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.47C11.25 P = 0.007) and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.01C15.28 P = 0.001) in patients with COVID-19.

Prediction explanation is important, especially in the medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. Specific Problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of an input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. Results: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features. We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\\\\pm$0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04$\\\\pm$1.06 with p=0.57).

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1 trial in India between July 2020 and October 2020. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of four treatment arms in a dose escalation manner.

While extensive research both before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 implicates horseshoe bat as the significant reservoir genus for the new coronavirus, it remains unclear why it emerged at this time. One massive disruption to human-animal contact in 2019 is linked to the on-going African swine fever virus (ASFV) pandemic. This began in Georgia in 2007 and was introduced to China in 2018. Pork is the major meat source in the Chinese diet. Severe fluctuations in the pork market prior to December 2019, may have increased the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndromeCrelated coronaviruses, from wildlife to humans, wildlife to livestock and non-local animals to local animals. The major production and consumption regions for pork are geographically separated in China. The dramatic shortage of pork following restrictions of pig movement and culling resulted in price increases, leading to alternative meat consumption and unusual animal and meat movements nationwide such as wildlife and thus greatly increased opportunities for human-sarbecovirus contacts. Pork prices were particularly high in southern provinces (Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei), where wildlife is farmed on different scales and more frequently consumed. Shandong experienced the biggest losses in pork production (~2 million metric tons), which is also the largest mink farming province. Hence, exposure of SARS-CoV-2 from wildlife or infected animals to humans by contact and consumption are more likely to have taken place in 2019, a year when China was experiencing the worst effects of the ASFV pandemic.","output":"How One Pandemic Led To Another: Asfv, the Disruption Contributing To Sars-Cov-2 Emergence in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.

Although exotic species are contributing to aquaculture production, a few of them are causing biodiversity loss and genetic erosion of native species. The African catfish Clarias gariepinus is a highly carnivorous species and predates small indigenous freshwater fishes when escaping into natural water bodies. In addition, the hybridization of C. batrachus and C. gariepinus is considered a threat to the indigenous population. Although the government of Bangladesh has banned the farming of C. gariepinus, this species has been identified in local markets, and evidence of hybridization between C. gariepinus and C. batrachus has been found. This study revealed genetic erosion of native C. batrachus by the gene sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b. The phylogenetic tree confirmed the occurrences of hybridization between C. gariepinus and C. batrachus. Genetic erosion in the native catfish population is alarming for aquaculture sustainability and biodiversity conservation in Bangladesh. ABSTRACT: The African catfish Clarias gariepinus has been introduced for aquaculture in Bangladesh due to the scarcity of indigenous C. batrachus fingerlings. However, the government of Bangladesh has banned the farming of C. gariepinus due to the carnivorous nature of this species. Recently C. gariepinus has been reported by fish farmers and consumers in Bangladesh, and unplanned hybridization between native and exotic species has been suspected. This study attempts to know the purity of C. batrachus by analyzing mitochondrial genes. Both directly sequenced and retrieved Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb) genes from C. gareipinus and C. batrachus were analyzed by MEGA software. The morphologically dissimilar C. batrachus showed the least genetic distance (0.295) from C. gariepinus, which provided evidence of hybridization between the two species. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees showed that C. batrachus from Bangladesh did not cluster with C. batrachus of other countries, instead C. batrachus clustered with the exotic C. gariepinus. The suspected hybrid formed sister taxa with the exotic C. gariepinus. The study corroborates the genetic deterioration of C. batrachus by unplanned hybridization with the invasive C. gariepinus. Unplanned hybridization has deleterious consequences; therefore, immediate action is necessary for aquaculture sustainability and biodiversity conservation in Bangladesh.","output":"Invasion of African Clarias gariepinus Drives Genetic Erosion of the Indigenous C. batrachus in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND With significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV, the number of people with HIV in the United States steadily increases. Monitoring trends in HIV-related care outcomes is needed to inform programs aimed at reducing new HIV infections in the United States. SETTING The setting is 33 United States jurisdictions that as of December 2019 had complete laboratory reporting for specimens through September 2019. METHODS Estimated annual percent change (EAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess trends in stage of disease at time of diagnosis, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis. Differences in percentages were analyzed by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and transmission category for persons with HIV diagnosed from 2014-2018. RESULTS Among 133,477 persons with HIV diagnosed during 2014-2018, the percentage of persons that received a diagnosis classified as stage 0 increased 13.7% , stages 1-2 (early infections) increased 2.9%, stage 3 (AIDS) declined 1.5%, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis increased 2.3%, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis increased 6.5% per year, on average.

However, evidence on its impact on other crucial health domains, besides health practices, is lacking. We evaluated the causal effects of a school-based health education program on adolescents multidimensional psychological health factors. DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 140 lower secondary schools in Vietnam. After stratifying by district, schools were randomized 1:1 to either treatment or control groups. Students enrolled in the treatment schools received monthly stand-alone health education in five topics by school teachers at the class level, but control group students did not receive any intervention. The primary outcomes of the study were students non-cognitive skills, life satisfaction, aspirations gap, and the Health-Related Quality of Life at five-month follow-up. We estimated the intention-to-treat effects with the panel fixed effects model using student panel data. RESULTS: Of the 6,477 students enrolled at baseline, 2,958 (92%) treated and 2,967 (91%) control students completed the follow-up survey five months after baseline data collection from October to December 2018. Compared with controls, health education led to improved treatment school students self-efficacy (p-value = 0.013), presumed life satisfaction five years from the present (p-value = 0.001), aspirations gap for a socially and mentally healthy future (p-value = 0.036), and the Health-Related Quality of Life (p-value = 0.036). CONCLUSION: A school-based health education program enhanced students non-cognitive skills, life satisfaction and aspirations gap, and the Health-Related Quality of Life significantly.

This is one of the major concerns associated with several components of our regular life such as food, health, water and energy. In the healthcare sector, biofouling on medical devices is known to cause infections, which are often resistant to conventional antibiotics and lead to increase in the number of hospital and surgery-related deaths. One of the better ways to tackle the problem of biofouling is the development of smart antifouling materials that can produce a biocompatible, non-toxic, eco-friendly and functional coating and maintain a biological environment without any adverse effect. To this end, in the present study, we have reported the design and synthesis of two simple chemically modified peptides, namely, PA1 (PFB-VVD) and PA2 (PFB-LLE). The design as well as the amino acid sequence of the peptides contains three basic components that enable their ability to (i) self-assemble into functional coatings, (ii) bind with the desired surface via the bi-dentate coordination of dicarboxylate groups and (iii) exhibit antifouling activity and generate a non-toxic biocompatible supramolecular coating on the desired surface. PA1 having aspartic acid as the anchoring moiety exhibits better antifouling activity compared to PA2 that has glutamic acid as the anchoring moiety. This is probably due to the greater adhesive force or binding affinity of aspartic acid to the examined surface compared to that of glutamic acid, as confirmed by force measurement studies using AFM. Most importantly, the simple drop-coating method promises great advantages due to its ease of operation, which leads to a reduction in the production cost and increase in the scope of commercialization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an ultra-short peptide-based smart antifouling material with a dicarboxylate group as the surface binding moiety. Furthermore, these findings promise to provide further insights into antifouling mechanisms in the future by the development of a smart material using a dicarboxylate group as an anchoring moiety.","output":"The design and development of short peptide-based novel smart materials to prevent fouling by the formation of non-toxic and biocompatible coatings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing pre-existing heart diseases early in life is important as it helps prevent complications such as pulmonary hypertension, heart rhythm problems, blood clots, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest.

We evaluate this hypothesis on a subset of the PhysioNet Challenge 2016 Dataset which contains simultaneously acquired PCG and ECG recordings. Our novel Dual-Convolutional Neural Network based approach uses transfer learning to tackle the problem of having limited amounts of simultaneous PCG and ECG data that is publicly available, while having the potential to adapt to larger datasets. In addition, we introduce two main evaluation frameworks named record-wise and sample-wise evaluation which leads to a rich performance evaluation for the transfer learning approach. Comparisons with methods which used single or dual modality data show that our method can lead to better performance.

Our main objective was to examine the association between in-hospital death and each routine at-home glucose-lowering drug both individually and in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19. We also evaluated their association with the composite outcome of the need for ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death as well as on the development of in-hospital complications and a long-time hospital stay. METHODS: We selected all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine's registry of COVID-19 patients (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). It is an ongoing, observational, multicenter, nationwide cohort of patients admitted for COVID-19 in Spain from March 1, 2020. Each glucose-lowering drug user was matched with a user of other glucose-lowering drugs in a 1:1 manner by propensity scores. In order to assess the adequacy of propensity score matching, we used the standardized mean difference found in patient characteristics after matching. There was considered to be a significant imbalance in the group if a standardized mean difference > 10% was found. To evaluate the association between treatment and study outcomes, both conditional logit and mixed effect logistic regressions were used when the sample size was &#8805; 100. RESULTS: A total of 2666 patients were found in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, 1297 on glucose-lowering drugs in monotherapy and 465 in combination with metformin. After propensity matching, 249 patients on metformin, 105 on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 129 on insulin, 127 on metformin/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 34 on metformin/sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and 67 on metformin/insulin were selected. No at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed a significant association with in-hospital death; the composite outcome of the need of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death; in-hospital complications; or long-time hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19, at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed no significant association with mortality and adverse outcomes.

To gain insight into the role of the thymus in the pathogenesis of this experimental model, pathologic responses and cell wall tissue distribution were compared in congenitally athymic rats (rnu/rnu) and their euthymic littermates (NIH/rnu). Within 24 h, both rat strains developed acute arthritis, characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocytic exudate in the synovium and joint spaces. This acute process was maximal at day 3 and gradually subsided. Beginning 2-3 wk after injection, the euthymic, but not the athymic, rats developed the typical exacerbation of arthritis, characterized by synovial cell hyperplasia with villus formation and T helper/inducer lymphocyte-rich mononuclear cell infiltration. This process eventually resulted in marginal erosions and destruction of periarticular bone and cartilage. Parallel development of acute and chronic hepatic lesions was observed. Bacterial cell wall antigen distribution and persistence were similar in the athymic and euthymic rats. Cell wall antigens were demonstrated in the cytoplasm of cells within subchondral bone marrow, synovium, liver, and spleen, coincident with the development of the acute lesions, and persisted in these sites, although in decreasing amounts, for the duration of the experiment.

The aim of this study is to assess the benefit of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for persons diagnosed with fibromyalgia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults meeting diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive either an active (n=62) or sham (n=57) wearable TENS device for 3-months. Subjects were classified as having lower or higher pain sensitivity by Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC, primary outcome) and secondary efficacy measures including Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ) were assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 3-months. Treatment effects were determined by a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (N=119). A pre-specified subgroup analysis of pain sensitivity was conducted using an interaction term in the model. RESULTS: No differences were found between active and sham treatment on PGIC scores at 3-months (0.34, 95% CI [?0.37, 1.04], p=0.351) in the ITT population. However, in subjects with higher pain sensitivity (n=60), PGIC was significantly greater for active treatment compared to sham (1.19, 95% CI [0.24, 2.13], p=0.014). FIQR total score (?7.47, 95% CI [?12.46, ?2.48], p=0.003), FIQR pain item (?0.62, 95% CI [?1.17, ?0.06], p=0.029), BPI Interference (?0.70, 95% CI [?1.30, ?0.11], p=0.021) and PDQ (?1.69, 95% CI [?3.20, ?0.18], p=0.028) exhibited significant improvements for active treatment compared to sham in the ITT population. Analgesics use was stable and comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated modest treatment effects of reduced disease impact, pain and functional impairment from wearable TENS in individuals with fibromyalgia. Subjects with higher pain sensitivity exhibited larger treatment effects than those with lower pain sensitivity. Wearable TENS may be a safe treatment option for people with fibromyalgia.

They quickly turned to restrictions on the freedom of movement and assembly in the form of forced isolation, mandatory quarantines and lockdowns. Africas first confirmed case was not until 14 February in Egypt and March saw a steady spread of the virus throughout the African continent. Concern began to rise about the impact that the virus would have on a continent that is currently facing HIV and TB epidemics and sporadic outbreaks of Ebola and Lassa Fever. There were fears that the already weakened health systems in many African jurisdictions may be unable to cope with another pandemic and quick and decisive action to stop the spread of the virus was considered to be essential. On 15 March 2020, nine days after the first recorded case in South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a State of Disaster. Over the following weeks, a series of regulations were promulgated that limited the freedom of movement and assembly, limited the sale of certain items, specifically prohibited the sale and transportation of alcohol and cigarettes and criminalised the spread of disinformation on COVID-19. Together they represent the greatest limits on the Bill of Rights in post-apartheid South Africa. However, public health strategies such as social distancing and regular hand washing are a privilege many in South Africa cannot afford, especially for thosein crowded informal settlements and who use mass public transport systems.

However, telehealth has not been widely implemented to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection in quarantined individuals. Moreover, studies on the cost-effectiveness of quarantine measures during the COVID-19 pandemic are scarce. OBJECTIVE: In this cohort study, we aimed to use telehealth to monitor COVID-19 infections in 217 quarantined Taiwanese travelers and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the quarantine program. METHODS: Travelers were quarantined for 14 days at the Taiwan Yangmingshan quarantine center and monitored until they were discharged. The travelers clinical symptoms were evaluated twice daily. A multidisciplinary medical team used the telehealth system to provide timely assistance for ill travelers. The cost of the mandatory quarantine was calculated according to data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan. RESULTS: All 217 quarantined travelers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to the quarantine center. During the quarantine, 28/217 travelers (12.9%) became ill and were evaluated via telehealth. Three travelers with fever were hospitalized after telehealth assessment, and subsequent tests for COVID-19 were negative for all three patients. The total cost incurred during the quarantine was US $193,938, which equated to US $894 per individual. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is an effective instrument for monitoring COVID-19 infection in quarantined travelers and could help provide timely disease management for people who are ill.

METHODS: The evaluation covered the period of 2012C2015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility. RESULTS: During the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.","output":"Evaluation of the influenza-like illness surveillance system in Tunisia, 2012C2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At Dialysis Clinic Inc., a national dialysis provider, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on delivery of care by comparing the risk of mortality and hospitalization month-over-month over three years.

AIM: We evaluated if in-hospital administration of heparin improved survival in a large cohort of Italian COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 2,574 unselected patients hospitalized in 30 clinical centers in Italy from February 19, 2020 to June 5, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection were analyzed. The primary endpoint in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin [UFH]) with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores. RESULTS: Out of 2,574 COVID-19 patients, 70.1% received heparin. LMWH was largely the most used formulation (99.5%). Death rates for patients receiving heparin or not were 7.4 and 14.0 per 1,000 person-days, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found a 40% lower risk of death in patients receiving heparin (hazard ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.74; E-value = 2.04). This association was particularly evident in patients with a higher severity of disease or strong coagulation activation. CONCLUSION: In-hospital heparin treatment was associated with a lower mortality, particularly in severely ill COVID-19 patients and in those with strong coagulation activation.

Method: 86 Covid-19 recovered subjects performed, after 39 days on average, physical examination and arterial blood gas (ABG) examination, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Subjects also quantified their dyspnoea and cough using a visual analogic scale (VAS) at three-time points: previously than COVID infection, during COVID hospitalization, and currently. The 76 subjects with reliable ABG during the hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p/F): mild: p/F>300 (n = 38);moderate: 200<p/F<300 (n = 30), severe p/F < 200 (n = 20). Results: In this cohort, Covid-19 recovered subjects still reported significant residual dyspnoea at the visit time.

In study 1, high school students, undergraduates, and graduates were assigned to read either five struggle stories or five achievement stories of role models.

Their mindsets were measured before reading stories and after reading each story. The results showed that the growth mindsets of undergraduates with low perseverance increased after reading two struggle stories of role models, and increased further after reading five struggle stories of role models. More importantly, the level of growth mindsets of undergraduates with low perseverance was equal to that of undergraduates with high perseverance after reading five struggle stories of role models.

Tracking activation of multiple signaling proteins simultaneously in patient samples can be challenging especially with limiting cell numbers within rare sub-populations. METHODS The NanoPro 1000 system (ProteinSimple) is built on an automated, capillary-based immunoassay platform and enables a rapid and quantitative analysis of specific proteins and their phosphorylation states. We have utilized this nano-immunoassay to examine activation of Akt 1/2/3 and downstream mTOR target--eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1). RESULTS Assays for Akt 1/2/3 and 4EBP1 were standardized using AML cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-14, OCI-AML3 and HL-60) prior to testing in patient samples. Target inhibition was studied using mTOR 1/2 inhibitor AZD-8055 and results were corroborated by Western blotting. The assay was able to quantify nanogram amounts of 4EBP1 and Akt 1/2/3 in AML cell lines and primary pediatric AML samples and results were quantifiable, consistent and reproducible.

The described cases are one of the earliest cases of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent. Methods: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA. Results and Discussion: During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment. Conclusion: Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.","output":"Clinical Profile of Covid-19 Infected Patients Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 was indeed a global epidemic that revolutionized the way of life, especially health-care services The way health care will be delivered will undergo a dramatic change in the future The aim is to analyse the increasing usage of health care systems along with digital technology and IoT especially during pandemic Design Methodology Approach: This research paper deals with users perception and their recommendation status of IoT-based smart health-care monitoring devices based on their perception, experience and level of importance to enhance the quality of life An effective artificial neural networking (ANN)-based predictive model is designed to classify the users perception of usage of IoT-based smart health-care monitoring wearables based on their experience and knowledge Findings: The model developed has 96 7% accuracy Among the various predictors chosen as inputs for the model, the findings indicate that self-comfort and trusted data from the device are of high priority The present study focused only on some common factors derived from previous studies Research Limitations Implications: Although the performance of the proposed system was noticed to be good, the size of the sample is also limited to a few responses Implications for future research and practices are discussed Originality Value: This is a novel study that aims to develop an ANN model on analyzing the users perception of IoT-based smart health-care wearables with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic This paper elaborates on the ongoing efforts to restart the health-care services for survivability in the new normal situations ?

This challenge is reflected not only in the observable economic depression, but also in emotional damage (loss of well-being) which has been widely ignored. This paper estimates the effect of the epidemic on the well-being of Chinese residents by capturing the emotions conveyed via massive social media, combined with city-level epidemic data. We also use station-level weather data and spatial geographic distance from the epicenter (Wuhan) to construct instrumental variables to better overcome the endogeneity problems of the estimations. We confirm the significant negative impact of the outbreak on life satisfaction, with an extra 1% of cumulative death cases associated with a 0.54% decrease in expressed happiness. Meanwhile, we find that well-being drops the most in regions with high-level risk of COVID-19, especially for females. Further, happiness in regions with higher or lower income levels are more vulnerable to the effects of the epidemic, while intermediate-level income regions are relatively insensitive. We also found that public announcements regarding the WHO pandemic and city-unlocking significantly affect residents sentiment. The interaction between the outbreak and real-time expressed happiness provides an important opportunity for reflection on the current governance policies of epidemic containment.","output":"The COVID-19 Outbreak Decreases Residents Self-Reported Happiness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study adopted the multi-level governance theory for a comparative analysis of how the structure and modes of policy coordination shaped subnational policy responses to COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, and New York State, USA It was found that both countries showed a hybrid form of vertical and horizontal coordination in COVID-19 responses despite different political systems Hubei depended more on vertical steering and horizontal support whereas New York took the primary coordinating role while a nationwide strategy was missing Contingent upon each country's political legacy, effective multi-level governance in crisis responses should balance national leadership with local autonomy and societal engagement [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Multi-Level Governance, Policy Coordination and Subnational Responses to COVID-19: Comparing China and the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic oxygen desaturation and positional dyspnea from supine to an upright position.

POS was first observed during physiotherapy sessions; median oxygen desaturation was 8 % (range: 8-12 %).

While POS caused alarm and reduced tolerance to therapy, this phenomenon resolved over a median of 17 days with improvement of parenchymal disease. The mechanisms of POS are likely due to gravitational redistribution of pulmonary blood flow resulting in increased basal physiological shunting and upper zone dead space ventilation due to the predominantly basal distribution of consolidative change and reported vasculoplegia and microthrombi in severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Reversible platypnea-orthodeoxia in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has made tremendous progress in advancing its national HIV program.

Adolescents may use many devices at night, which can provide additional night-time SV. Purpose: To identify night-time SV patterns, and describe differences in diet, sleep, weight status, and adiposity between patterns in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. Methods: Adolescents (10C16 y) reported devices they viewed at night and completed food recalls. Accelerometry, anthropometrics, and imaging were conducted to measure sleep, weight status, and adiposity, respectively. Latent class analysis was performed to identify night-time SV clusters. Linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between clusters with diet, sleep, weight status, and adiposity. Results: Amongst 273 adolescents (12.5  1.9 y, 54% female, 59% White), four clusters were identified: no SV (36%), primarily cellphone (32%), TV and portable devices (TV+PDs, 17%), and multiple PDs (17%). Most differences in sleep and adiposity were attenuated after adjustment for covariates. The TV+PDs cluster had a higher waist circumference than the no SV cluster in cross-sectional analysis. In longitudinal analysis, the primarily cellphone cluster had less change in waist circumference compared to the no SV cluster.

In this international, multicenter study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography, we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free-wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient comorbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], P = .003), previous lung disease (OR = 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], P = .015), LVLS (OR = 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], P = .012), lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], P = .009), and RVFWS (OR = 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, lactic dehydrogenase, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

About 30% of these patients express a need for physical rehabilitation and patients prefer to be involved in medical decision-making. This includes being offered individualised treatment with patient-defined goals and education during all aspects of treatment by physiotherapists with empathic skills. However, physiotherapists are often unaware of the relationship between cancer and its presenting symptoms. This can lead to inappropriate care and unrealistic goalsetting for rehabilitation. This calls for greater attention towards physiotherapists treatment and their current perspectives on how treatment can be improved in physiotherapy clinics. The aim of this study is to explore physiotherapists perspectives on barriers, facilitators and potential solutions to improve the care of sequelae after cancer in physiotherapy clinics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a qualitative interview study using individual semistructured interviews with physiotherapists using a phenomenological approach to explore their lifeworld at work. We will recruit physiotherapists working in private clinics based on a variation in gender and years of working experience in private clinics. We will conduct between 10 and 16 interviews online via Microsoft Teams and thematically analyse data supported by NVivo software. Interviewing is scheduled to take place from April 2022.

Machine learning provides science-based tools that can be used for clinical decision-making which have already been applied to the fight against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) both in the therapeutic and the prevention area. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning-based tool to support primary care physicians to decide between home monitoring and hospitalization for their patients before diagnostic test results are available. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study with data from a hospital setting was performed. Patients' medical history and clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were collected and the dataset was used to train a predictive model for COVID-19 severity. The patients were divided between confirmed and suspect cases on the basis of the positivity of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test results. A splitting algorithm was recursively used to choose the predictor. A decision tree was built. RESULTS: A total of 198 subjects were enrolled for the study. Out of them, 28 cases were classified as mild disease, 62 as moderate disease, 64 as severe disease, and 44 as critical disease, according to WHO guidelines. The G2 value was used to determine the contribution of each obtained value to build the decision tree. The tree was, therefore, built choosing values that maximized G2 and LogWorth. SpO2 (cut point = 92%) was chosen for the optimal first split. The correspondence between inputs and outcomes was validated. CONCLUSIONS: Our tool provides accurate clinical severity prediction for both confirmed and suspect COVID-19 patients. We, therefore, propose its implementation in the everyday life challenges of primary care physicians to support their clinical decision-making in providing appropriate and timely care for their patients.

We used a standardized checklist to assess and collect specific content, including information regarding LCS staff composition and references to radiologists and radiology. We also tabulated types and frequencies of included multimedia and multilingual content and patient narratives. RESULTS: We analyzed 257 unique websites. Of these, only 48% (124 of 257) referred to radiologists or radiology in text, images, or videos. Radiologists were featured in images or videos on only 14% (36 of 257) of websites. Radiologists were most frequently acknowledged for their roles in reading or interpreting imaging studies (35% [90 of 574]).

Here we explore the possibility that subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent Covid-19 in individuals at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by close exposure in a household with a documented SARS-CoV-2Cinfected individual. METHODS: Individuals 12 years were enrolled within 96 hours of a household contact being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and randomized 1:1 to receive 1200 mg REGEN-COV or placebo via subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants without evidence of infection (SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCRCnegative) or prior immunity (seronegative) who subsequently developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 28-day efficacy assessment period. RESULTS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV significantly prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with placebo (81.4% risk reduction; 11/753 [1.5%] vs. 59/752 [7.8%], respectively; P<0.0001), with 92.6% risk reduction after the first week (2/753 [0.3%] vs. 27/752 [3.6%], respectively). REGEN-COV also prevented overall infections, either symptomatic or asymptomatic (66.4% risk reduction). Among infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV vs. placebo (1.2 vs. 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of time with high viral load (>10(4) copies/mL) was lower (0.4 vs. 1.3 weeks, respectively).

Thanks to their biocompatibility and magnetic properties, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are particularly attractive as antibiotic carriers for the targeting therapy. IONPs can direct conjugated antibiotics to infection sites by the use of an external magnet, facilitating tissue penetration and disturbing biofilm formation. As a consequence of antibiotic localization, a decrease in its administration dosage might be possible, reducing the side effects to non-targeted organs and the risk of antibiotic resistance spread in the commensal microbiota. Here, we prepared nanoformulations of the last-resort glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin by conjugating them to IONPs via surface functionalization with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). These superparamagnetic NP-TEICO and NP-VANCO were chemically stable and NP-TEICO (better than NP-VANCO) conserved the typical spectrum of antimicrobial activity of glycopeptide antibiotics, being effective against a panel of staphylococci and enterococci, including clinical isolates and resistant strains. By a combination of different methodological approaches, we proved that NP-TEICO and, although to a lesser extent, NP-VANCO were effective in reducing biofilm formation by three methicillin-sensitive or resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Moreover, when attracted and concentrated by the action of an external magnet, NP-TEICO exerted a localized inhibitory effect on S. aureus biofilm formation at low antibiotic concentration. Finally, we proved that the conjugation of glycopeptide antibiotics to IONPs reduced their intrinsic cytotoxicity toward a human cell line.","output":"Antimicrobial Activity of Nanoconjugated Glycopeptide Antibiotics and Their Effect on Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which infected >200 million people resulting in >4 million deaths.

Here, we report a high-resolution atlas of the translatome and transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 for various time points after infecting human cells. Intriguingly, substantial amount of SARS-CoV-2 translation initiates at a novel translation initiation site (TIS) located in the leader sequence, termed TIS-L. Since TIS-L is included in all the genomic and subgenomic RNAs, the SARS-CoV-2 translatome may be regulated by a sophisticated interplay between TIS-L and downstream TISs. TIS-L functions as a strong translation enhancer for ORF S, and as translation suppressors for most of the other ORFs. Our global temporal atlas provides compelling insight into unique regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and helps comprehensively evaluate its impact on the human genome.","output":"A high-resolution temporal atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and transcriptome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: [Formula: see text] may be a reliable noninvasive alternative to the [Formula: see text] index.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID\\\\19 in China. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included pediatric patients from 46 hospitals in China, covering 12 provinces and two municipalities. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 211 pediatric patients with COVID\\\\19 were included in this study. The median age was 7.0 years (range: 22 days to 18 years). Approximately 16.3% of the patients exhibited asymptomatic infections, 23.0% had upper respiratory tract infections, and 60.7% had pneumonia, including two with severe pneumonia and one with critical illness. Approximately 78.7% of the pediatric patients occurred in familial clusters. The most three common symptoms or signs at onset in children with COVID\\\\19 were fever (54.5%), cough (49.3%), and pharyngeal congestion (20.8%). Only 17.6% of the patients presented with decreased lymphocyte count, whereas 13.6% had increased lymphocyte count. Among the patients with pneumonia who exhibited abnormal chest computed tomography findings, 18.2% (23/127) of the patients had no other symptoms. Generally, the chest radiographs showed abnormalities that affected both lungs (49.6%); ground\\\\glass opacity (47.2%) was the most common manifestation. The cure and improvement rates were 86.7% (183/211) and 13.3% (28/211), respectively.

Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides.

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. METHODS: We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 serum) and in France (20,652 serum) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 serum, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. RESULTS: The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0; P = 0.04).

Results Overall, n=1,010 cases of CL consisting of n=479 male and n=531 female were analyzed for probable infection with SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, in the case group, two men and one woman (0.3%) were afflicted with a mild form of COVID-19 disease, and none of them were hospitalized or died. In contrast, out of n=2,020 healthy participants, n=57 (2.9%) contracted laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including mild (66.7%), hospitalized (26.3%) and critical and death (3.5%, each). There was a strong negative association between CL infection and COVID-19. The burden of COVID-19 in CL-cured participants significantly reduced the morbidity (OR=0.12, CI: 0.03 - 0.30 and P <0.001) and mortality (percentile: -4.10, -0.02). Conclusion Participants with a history of previous CL scar significantly prevented the incidence of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

However, the capacity of immunobiotics to improve protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was not investigated before. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were: a) to evaluate whether the nasal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) are able to improve respiratory antiviral defenses and beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by TLR3/RIG-I activation; b) to investigate whether viability of Lr05 or Lr06 is indispensable to modulate respiratory immunity and; c) to evaluate the capacity of Lr05 and Lr06 to improve the resistance of infant mice against RSV infection. RESULTS: Nasally administered Lr05 and Lr06 differentially modulated the TLR3/RIG-I-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response. Lr06 administration significantly modulated the production of IFN-, IFN- and IL-6 in the response to poly(I:C) challenge, while nasal priming with Lr05 was more effective to improve levels of IFN- and IL-10. Both viable Lr05 and Lr06 strains increased the resistance of infant mice to RSV infection while only heat-killed Lr05 showed a protective effect similar to those observed with viable strains. CONCLUSIONS: The present work demonstrated that nasal administration of immunobiotics is able to beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by TLR3/RIG-I activation in the respiratory tract and to increase the resistance of mice to the challenge with RSV. Comparative studies using two Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of the same origin and with similar technological properties showed that each strain has an specific immunoregulatory effect in the respiratory tract and that they differentially modulate the immune response after poly(I:C) or RSV challenges, conferring different degree of protection and using distinct immune mechanisms.

Volunteering medical students can be a valuable asset during such times. This study investigated the willingness of medical students to volunteer during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the barriers to doing so, considering the possibility of exposure to COVID-19 and mode of contact. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered online questionnaire adapted from the literature. The questionnaire comprised four parts: demographic variables, COVID-19-related variables, willingness scale, and barrier scale. The target population was medical students at four different colleges in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 802 students participated in the study. A small proportion of students (10.6%) were willing to participate in volunteering activities that could involve contact with patients with COVID-19 as compared to other settings (39.4C43.4%). More than one-quarter of students (26.8%) had risk factors for severe COVID-19. The main barrier to volunteering was the concern of transmitting the infection to family members (76.8%). Registration to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was positively associated with more willingness to volunteer (=0.17, p <0.001), whereas residing in a household with an elderly person was negatively associated (=?0.13, p <0.001). Female sex was positively associated with higher barrier score (=0.12, p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Medical students were more willing to volunteer in activities that did not involve direct contact with patients with COVID-19. A considerable proportion of participants had risk factors for severe illness. Sharing a household with an elderly person or child was associated with lower willingness to volunteer. Organizers of volunteering activities should offer various volunteering options considering the risk of infection; and be mindful of barriers to volunteering, especially risk factors for severe illness and eldercare and childcare responsibilities.","output":"Which Volunteering Settings Do Medical Students Prefer During a Novel Respiratory Virus Pandemic?

According to current available data, the cytokine storm appears to be the most life-threatening symptom of severe COVID-19 cases accompanied with lung fibrosis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of soluble -galactoside-binding lectin families, has been implicated as a key regulator in various inflammation conditions in addition to its well-documented roles in cancer. The pro-inflammatory activity of Gal-3 in the inflammatory response and lung fibrosis of COVID-19 has been proposed by emerging studies, which suggested that inhibition of Gal-3 may represent a novel treatment approach for COVID-19 patients. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. ICC accounts for 10C25% of primary liver cancers with limited therapeutic options, which has higher incidence in Asian countries, particularly in China. Cancer patients, including ICC patients, are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their impaired immune system. It is thus undoubtedly a challenge for our oncology department to establish effective treatment strategies under the influence of the COVID-19 crisis. According to our management procedures in the COVID-19 era, emergency treatment will be applied to ICC patients who are under life-threatening conditions, despite the COVID-19 infection.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has only magnified the need to address health among vulnerable populations. While there has been a growing trend in the delivery of telehealth interventions, the delivery of such methods for children on the autism spectrum, and their caregivers remains relatively under examined. The primary goal of PLANE (Physical Literacy And Nutrition Education) is to promote positive trajectories of health for children on the autism spectrum and their primary caregivers through the delivery of a telehealth physical activity and nutrition education program. The study is a pre-experimental analysis of PLANE across 12 months. All activities will be delivered virtually through weekly synchronous and asynchronous programming. A total of 180 participants will be enrolled in this intervention, including children on the autism spectrum and caregivers. Each week a new physical activity skill along with opportunities for recipe assembly will be delivered remotely. Supplemental material will be disseminated online including; step by step directions outlining behavioral skill methodology, opportunities for additional skill practice, and reading material that support weekly topics. Study outcomes will be examined in the parent-child dyad and include rates of overweight/obesity, physical activity, nutrition and quality of life. Finally, feasibility of the telehealth intervention will also be measured. Justification for the conceptualization and delivery of PLANE is well warranted, and PLANE represents a promising intervention which is scalable, sustainable, and replicable.","output":"Promoting physical activity participation and nutrition education through a telehealth intervention for children on the autism spectrum and their caregivers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The question is not whether to use new data sources but how.","output":"Ethics and governance for digital disease surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lupin (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) is a legume domesticated and cultivated for more than 4000 years by the pre-Hispanic cultures of the Andean zone. Due to its good taste and protein content, the lupin seed contributes significantly to the food and nutritional security of the Andean population. However, lupin is susceptible to diseases, and of these, anthracnose is the most devastating as it affects the whole crop, including leaves, stems, pods, and seeds. This review focuses on available strategies for management of lupin anthracnose from sowing to harvest. Seed disinfection is the primary anthracnose management strategy. Seed treatment with fungicides reduces transmission from seed to seedling, but it does not eradicate anthracnose. Attention is given to alternative strategies to limit this seed-borne pathogen as well as to enhance plant resistance and to promote plant growth. For anthracnose management in the field, integrated practices are discussed that encompass control of volunteer plants, lupin ontogenetic resistance, and rotation of biocontrol with chemical fungicides at susceptible phenological stages.

The real-time emergence of COVID-19 disparities has heightened the public and scientific discourse about structural inequities contributing to the greater risk of morbidity and mortality among racial and ethnic minority populations and other underserved groups. A key aspect of assuring health equity is addressing social determinants that lead to adverse health outcomes among minoritized groups. This article presents an exploratory social determinants of health (SDOH) conceptual framework for understanding racial and ethnic COVID-19 disparities, including factors related to health and healthcare, socioeconomics, and environmental determinants. The model also illustrates the backdrop of structural racism and discrimination, which directly affect health and COVID-19 exposure risk, and thus transmission, infection, and death. We also describe a special SDOH collection in the PhenX Toolkit (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures), which includes established measures to promote standardization of assessment and the use of common data elements in research contexts. The use of common constructs, measures, and data elements are important for data integration, understanding the causes of health disparities, and evaluating interventions to reduce them. Substandard SDOH are among the primary drivers of health disparities-and scientific approaches to address these key concerns require identification and leveled alignment with the root causes. The overarching goal of this discussion is to broaden the consideration of mechanisms by which populations with health disparities face additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks, and to encourage research to develop interventions to reduce SDOH-associated disparities in COVID-19 and other conditions and behaviors.","output":"COVID-19 Health Disparities and Adverse Social Determinants of Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most prevalent type of stroke, after ischemic stroke, and has exceptionally high morbidity and mortality rates. After spontaneous ICH, one primary goal is to restrict hematoma expansion, and the second is to limit brain edema and secondary injury. Various types of transfusion therapies have been studied as treatment options to alleviate the adverse effects of ICH etiopathology. The objective of this work is to review transfusions with platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), and red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with ICH. Furthermore, tranexamic acid infusion studies have been included due to its connection to ICH and hematoma expansion. As stated, the first line of therapy is limiting bleeding in the brain and hematoma expansion. Platelet transfusion is used to promote recovery and mitigate brain damage, notably in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Additionally, tranexamic acid infusion, FFP, and PCC transfusion have been shown to affect hematoma expansion rate and volume. Although there is limited available research, RBC transfusions have been shown to cause higher tissue oxygenation and lower mortality, notably after brain edema, increases in intracranial pressure, and hypoxia. However, these types of transfusion have varied results depending on the patient, hemostasis status/blood thinner, hemolysis, anemia, and complications, among other variables.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Asir Central Hospital in Saudi Arabia between the 1st and 30th of June 2020. Data extracted from patients medical records included their demographics, home medications, medications used to treat COVID-19, treatment durations, ICU stay, hospital stay, and ultimate outcome (recovery or death).Descriptive statistics and regression modelling were used to analyze and compare the results. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees at both Asir Central Hospital and King Khalid University. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients with median age of 57 years having definite clinical and disease outcomes were included in the study. Male patients accounted for 87% of the study population, and more than 65% experienced at least one comorbidity. The mean hospital and ICU stay was 11.4 and 9.8 days, respectively. The most common drugs used were tocilizumab (31.4%), triple combination therapy (45.8%), favipiravir (56.8%), dexamethasone (86.7%), and enoxaparin (83%). Treatment with enoxaparin significantly reduced the length of ICU stay (p = 0.04) and was found to be associated with mortality reduction in patients aged 50?75 (p = 0.03), whereas the triple regimen therapy and tocilizumab significantly increased the length of ICU stay in all patients (p = 0.01, p = 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 tends to affect males more significantly than females. The use of enoxaparin is an important part of COVID-19 treatment, especially for those above 50 years of age, while the use of triple combination therapy and tocilizumab in COVID-19 protocols should be reevaluated and restricted to patients who have high likelihood of benefit.","output":"COVID-19 related treatment and outcomes among COVID-19 ICU patients: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a cytokine storm syndrome associated with mortality rates of up to 88%.

We also demonstrate the utility of the new software by applying it to viral screening of the feces of bats collected in the Moscow region, which revealed a significant variety of viruses associated with bats, insects, plants, and protozoa. The presence of alpha and beta coronavirus reads, including the MERS-like bat virus, deserves a special mention, as it once again indicates that bats are indeed reservoirs for many viral pathogens. In addition, it was shown that alignment-based methods were unable to identify the taxon for a large proportion of reads, and we additionally applied other approaches, showing that they can further reveal the presence of viral agents in sequencing data. However, the incompleteness of viral databases remains a significant problem in the studies of viral diversity, and therefore necessitates the use of combined approaches, including those based on machine learning methods.","output":"Utilizing the VirIdAl Pipeline to Search for Viruses in the Metagenomic Data of Bat Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a world-wide pandemic since its onset in December of 2019.

Whether amputation rates vary within US metropolitan areas is unclear, as are characteristics of high amputation rate urban communities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated rates of major lower extremity amputation per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries between 2010 and 2018 at the ZIP code level among ZIP codes with 100 beneficiaries. We described demographic characteristics of high and low amputation ZIP codes, and the association between major amputation rate and 3 ZIP codeClevel markers of socioeconomic statusthe proportion of patients with dual eligibility for Medicaid, median household income, and Distressed Communities Index scorefor metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural ZIP code cohorts. Between 2010 and 2018, 188 995 Medicare fee\\\\for\\\\service patients living in 31 391 ZIP codes with 100 beneficiaries had a major lower extremity amputation. The median (interquartile range) ZIP codeClevel number of amputations per 100 000 beneficiaries was 262 (75C469). Though nonmetropolitan ZIP codes had higher rates of major amputation than metropolitan areas, 78.2% of patients undergoing major amputation lived in metropolitan areas. Compared with ZIP codes with lower amputation rates, top quartile amputation rate ZIP codes had a greater proportion of Black residents (4.4% versus 17.5%, P<0.001). In metropolitan areas, after adjusting for clinical comorbidities and demographics, every $10 000 lower median household income was associated with a 4.4% (95% CI, 3.9C4.8) higher amputation rate, and a 10\\\\point higher Distressed Communities Index score was associated with a 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4%C4.2%) higher amputation rate; there was no association between the proportion of patients eligible for Medicaid and amputation rate. These findings were comparable to the associations identified across all ZIP codes.

In this research, our team investigated the changes in the daily mobility pattern of people during the pandemic by utilizing an integrated data panel. To incorporate various aspects of human mobility, the team focused on the Social Distancing Index (SDI) which was calculated based on five basic mobility measures. The SDI patterns showed a plateau stage in the beginning of April that lasted for about two weeks. This phenomenon then followed by a universal decline of SDI, increased number of trips and reduction in percentage of people staying at home. We called the observation Quarantine Fatigue. The Rate of Change (ROC) method was employed to trace back the start date of quarantine fatigue which was indicated to be April 15th. Our analysis showed that despite the existence of state-to-state variations, most states started experiencing a quarantine fatigue phenomenon during the same period. This observation became more important by knowing that none of the states had officially announced the reopening until late April showing that people decided to loosen up their social distancing practices before the official reopening announcement. Moreover, our analysis indicated that official reopening led to a rapid decline in SDI, raising the concern of a second wave of outbreak. The synchronized trend among states also emphasizes the importance of a more nationwide decision-making attitude for the future as the condition of each state depends on the nationwide behavior.","output":"Quarantine Fatigue: first-ever decrease in social distancing measures after the COVID-19 outbreak before reopening United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: From an isolated epidemic, COVID-19 has now emerged as a global pandemic.

Recent studies have shown that lymphopenia and a cytokine mass release represent important pathogenic features, with clinical evidence of dyspnea and hypoxemia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in severely ill patients, with a high death toll. Currently, stem cells are actively being investigated for their potential use in many untreatable diseases. In this regard and in particular, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), due to their intrinsic features, including either ability to impact on regulation of the immune system, or association with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, or potential for differentiation into several cell lineages, have become a promising tool for cell and molecular-based therapies. On this background, we wished to explore whether human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMS) would represent a potential viable therapeutic approach for the management of critically ill COVID19 patients. Methods: We tested the hUCMS effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) retrieved from patients with COVID19 (Ethical Committee CEAS Umbria, Italy CER N3658/20 7, May, 2020), both as free cell monolayers and after envelopment in sodium alginate microcapsules. Both cell systems, after priming with IFN-, proved able to produce several immu-nomodulatory molecules such as IDO1 and HLAG5, although only the microencapsulated hUCMS were associated with massive and dose-dependent production of these factors. Results: The microencapsulated hUCMS improved allo-suppression in mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLRs), while also blunting T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses, that are involved with the cytokine storm and greatly contribute to the patient death. Moreover, we observed that both free and microencapsulated hUCMS permitted 5 days survival of in vitro culture maintained PBMCs extracted from very ill patients. Conclusion: We have provided evidence that microencapsulated hUCMS in vitro, seem to represent a powerful tool to impact on several immune pathways, clearly deranged in COVID19 patients. Further study is necessary to begin in vivo assessment of this experimental system, upon determining both, the most appropriate time of the disease onset for intervention, and cell dosage/patient of our experimental product.","output":"Microencapsulated wharton jelly-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells as a potential new therapeutic tool for patients with covid-19 disease: An in vitro study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a clear and present threat to global public health. Research into how the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus together with its individual constituent genes and proteins interact with target host cells can facilitate the development of improved strategies to manage the acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. In this study, to better understand the biological roles of critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we determined and compared the host transcriptomic responses of the HL-CZ human pro-monocytic cell line upon transfection with key viral genes encoding the spike S1 subunit, S2 subunit, nucleocapsid protein (NP), NSP15 (endoribonuclease), and NSP16 (2-O-ribose-methyltransferase). RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analysis and other bioinformatics tools revealed that host genes associated with topologically incorrect protein, virus receptor activity, heat shock protein binding, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antigen processing and presentation were up-regulated in the presence of viral spike S1 expression. With spike S2 expression, pro-monocytic genes associated with the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway were down-regulated, whereas those associated with cytokine-mediated signaling were up-regulated. The expression of NSP15 induced the up-regulation of genes associated with neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, oxidative phosphorylation, prion disease, and pathways of neurodegeneration. The expression of NSP16 resulted in the down-regulation of genes associated with S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity. The expression of NP down-regulated genes associated with positive regulation of neurogenesis, nervous system development, and heart development. Taken together, the complex transcriptomic alterations arising from these viral-host gene interactions offer useful insights into host genes and their pathways that potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","output":"Comparative Transcriptomic and Molecular Pathway Analyses of HL-CZ Human Pro-Monocytic Cells Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1, S2, NP, NSP15 and NSP16 Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension remains the leading cause of global mortality, with elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) leading to 10.8 million deaths each year. Despite this, only around 50% of individuals with hypertension are aware of their condition. Alongside low awareness rates, lack of patient adherence to medication and therapeutic inertia have been identified as factors contributing to the lack of hypertension control worldwide. This report summarizes presentations from the one of a kind Servier-sponsored symposium, Improving the Management of Hypertension: Acting on Key Factors, which was conducted as part of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)-International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2021 ON-AIR meeting. The symposium focused on how low awareness, therapeutic inertia, and nonadherence can be addressed by combining the experience of a patient with the expertise of physicians. May Measurement Month, the ongoing global BP measurement program, is raising awareness of hypertension in over 90 countries, and the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines and the 2020 ISH guidelines now include recommendations that specifically address low adherence and therapeutic inertia, including involving patients in a shared decision-making process and the use of single-pill combination therapy.

Natural selection selects variants with higher effective reproduction numbers, increasing the overall transmissibility of the circulating viruses. In order to establish effective control measures for a new variant, it is crucial to know its transmissibility and replacement time course in early phases of the variant replacement. In this paper, we conduct retrospective prediction tests of the variant replacement from Alpha to Delta in England. Our method firstly estimated the relative reproduction number, the ratio of the reproduction number of a variant to that of another, from partial observations up to a given time point. Secondly, the replacement time course after the time point was predicted based on the estimates of relative reproduction number. Thirdly, the estimated relative reproduction number and the predicted time course were evaluated by being compared to those estimated using the entire observations. We found that it is possible to estimate the relative reproduction number of Delta with respect to Alpha when the frequency of Delta was more than or equal to 0.25. Using these relative reproduction numbers, predictions targeting on 1st June 2021, the date when the frequency of Delta reached 0.90, had maximum absolute prediction errors of 0.015 for frequencies of Delta and 0.067 for the average relative reproduction number of circulating viruses with respect to Alpha. These results suggest that our method allows us to predict the time course of variant replacement in future from partial datasets observed in early phases of variant replacement.","output":"Predicting the time course of replacements of SARS-CoV-2 variants using relative reproduction numbers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen El desenlace de la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) afecta fundamentalmente al campo pulmonar, ocasionando un cuadro de SNDROME DE DISTRS RESPIRATORIO AGUDO (SDRA).

Here, we used a golden Syrian hamster model to systematically evaluate the kinetics of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, following disease pathology, viral loads, antibody responses, and inflammatory cytokine expression in multiple organs. The kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and genomewide lung transcriptome was also compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamsters. We observed that the body weight loss was proportional to the SARS-CoV-2 infectious dose and lasted for a short time only in immunocompetent hamsters. Body weight loss was more prominent and prolonged in infected immunocompromised hamsters. While the kinetics of viral replication and peak live viral loads were not significantly different at low and high infectious doses (LD and HD), the HD-infected immunocompetent animals developed severe lung disease pathology. The immunocompetent animals cleared the live virus in all tested tissues by 12 days post-infection and generated a robust serum antibody response. In contrast, immunocompromised hamsters mounted an inadequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response, and the virus was detected in the pulmonary and multiple extrapulmonary organs until 16 days post-infection. These hamsters also had prolonged moderate inflammation with severe bronchiolar-alveolar hyperplasia/metaplasia. Consistent with the difference in disease presentation, distinct changes in the expression of inflammation and immune cell response pathways and network genes were seen in the lungs of infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals. This study highlights the interplay between the kinetics of viral replication and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis at organ-level niches and maps how COVID-19 symptoms vary in different immune contexts. Together, our data suggest that the histopathological manifestations caused by progressive SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than individual measures of viral load, antibody response, and cytokine storm at the systemic or local (lungs) levels in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Comprehensive analysis of disease pathology in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persistent symptoms including dyspnea and functional impairment are common in COVID-19 survivors. Poor muscle quality (myosteatosis) associates with poor short-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this observational study was to assess the relationship between myosteatosis diagnosed during acute COVID-19 and patient-reported outcomes at 6 months after discharge. METHODS: Myosteatosis was diagnosed based on CT-derived skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SM-RA) measured during hospitalization in 97 COVID-19 survivors who had available anthropometric and clinical data upon admission and at the 6-month follow-up after discharge. Dyspnea in daily activities was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for dyspnea. Health-related quality of life was measured using the European quality of life questionnaire three-level version (EQ-5D-3L). RESULTS: Characteristics of patients with (lowest sex- and age-specific tertile of SM-RA) or without myosteatosis during acute COVID-19 were similar. At 6 months, patients with myosteatosis had greater rates of obesity (48.4 vs. 27.7%, p = 0.046), abdominal obesity (80.0 vs. 47.6%, p = 0.003), dyspnea (32.3 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.021) and mobility problems (32.3 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.004). Myosteatosis diagnosed during acute COVID-19 was the only significant predictor of persistent dyspnea (OR 3.19 [95% C.I. 1.04; 9.87], p = 0.043) and mobility problems (OR 3.70 [95% C.I. 1.25; 10.95], p = 0.018) at 6 months at logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, and BMI.

The authors analyzed changes in clinical drug testing patterns and results at a national clinical laboratory, comparing data obtained before and during the pandemic. Testing for prescription and illicit drugs declined rapidly during the pandemic, with weekly test volumes falling by approximately 70% from the baseline period to the trough (the week beginning March 29) before rising in subsequent weeks. Among individuals tested, positivity increased by 35% for non-prescribed fentanyl and 44% for heroin during the pandemic. Positivity for non-prescribed fentanyl increased significantly among patients positive for other drugs: by 89% for specimens positive for amphetamines; 48% for benzodiazepines; 34% for cocaine; and 39% for opiates (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). These findings suggest significant increases in dangerous drug combinations. Positivity for non-prescribed use of many other drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. Models adjusting for potential confounding variables, including medication-assisted treatment and treatment at a substance use disorder facility indicated that the risk for non-prescribed fentanyl positivity rose by more than 50% during the pandemic. In summary, these findings demonstrate decreased drug testing overall, with increased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations.

The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of colorectal resections during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective review of a prospective institutional database. All consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergent colorectal resections between March 9 and April 15, 2020, were compared to those treated in the same period of time in 2019.

With increasing attendances yearly and added system pressures due to COVID, we reviewed our triage system. In previous winters approximately only a third of the sickest patients presented by ambulance. The current system allows patients brought by ambulance to be triaged first, resulting in those brought by car waiting.ObjectivesTo develop a Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) arrival flow chart to be used by ambulance staff to improve getting the right patient triaged at the right time. By utilising the flowchart, patients needing immediate triage or treatment must be identified, whilst identifying those safe to wait in time of arrival with patients brought by other modes of transport.Secondary aims were to identify data for a group of patients that could potentially wait for triage without the SAS team.MethodsWe developed a Flow Chart to be used by ambulance staff with 2 outcome arms C immediate SBAR handover and triage with nursing staff (urgent), or wait for triage by time of arrival (non-urgent), based on red flags, observation parameters (national PEWS) and clinical concern. Red flags were exclusion criteria for subsequent completion of the chart and indicated the need for urgent triage. Following a 2 week pilot study in September 2020, all SAS arrivals notes were reviewed in conjunction with their flow chart outcomes.ResultsA total of 183 patients arrived by ambulance (10%). 71.6% of patients had a completed triage form or appropriate use of red flags/stand by status. 13.0% were stand by calls, 26.7% had red flags, 20.6% were classified as urgent and 39.7% as non-urgent.Review of all cases showed that patients subsequently triaged as category 1 and 2 had attended by car and patients of low acuity triage categories had attended by ambulance.Use of the flow chart showed that zero patients subsequently triaged as category 1 or 2 were classified as non-urgent by use of the flow chart.Mean time to triage for those who arrived by ambulance was 10:03 (mm:ss) with a maximum wait of 36:00. In comparison, those attending by other transport methods had a mean time to triage of 10:18, with a maximum wait time of 57:00. The total number of patients was significantly smaller than the previous year ruling out direct statistical comparison.29 (15.8%) patients were brought by ambulance and subsequently triaged as category 4 or 5. None of these patients deteriorated.ConclusionsArrival by ambulance does not always equate to acuity of presentation. The pilot demonstrated that the flowchart is safe in paediatrics with a robust list of red flags. With the national PEWS incorporated we can safely identify low acuity patients. The next pilot introduces a 3rd arm identifying low acuity patients with normal PEWS who do not require a verbal handover.

Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing S protein derived from either the bat RaTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S protein displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Unexpectedly, insertion of PRRA into the RaTG13 S protein selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but enhanced the usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins.ImportanceThe four-residue insert (PRRA) at the boundary between the S1and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized since day 1 for its role in SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing and activation. As this PRRA insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among group b betacoronaviruses, it is thought to affect the tissue and species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the usage of 10 ACE2 orthologs and found that the presence of PRRA not only affects the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 but also modulates the usage of ACE2 orthologs by the closely related bat RaTG13 S protein.

The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. METHODS: A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. RESULTS: A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (p < 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted p < 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%.

The authors presented 4 adult immunocompetent patients with acute aseptic meningitis with VZV infection diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). CASE PRESENTATION Four patients were admitted to the hospital with headache and fever between March 2018 and August 2019. The median ages were 37 years (range 22-52 years). The median symptoms onset to clinic time was 3.5 days (range 3-6 days). Two patients had signs of meningeal irritation. Rash occurred after the meningitis symptoms in 1 patient (time from meningitis symptoms to rash, 2 days). No other sign or symptom was reported. The brain Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were normal in all patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at a median of 4 days (range 3-7 days) from the meningitis symptoms onset. Opening pressure of lumbar puncture after admission were high in these cases (median 256 mm H2O; range 165-400 mm H2O). White blood cell counts and protein levels were significantly elevated in CSF samples (median 317  10^6/L, range 147-478  10^6/L; median 1.41 g/L, range 0.57-1.79 g/L). The cytology of CSF demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and most multinuclear cells. The culture of CSF was negative for all 4 cases, while T-cell spot test was positive for 2 cases, who were administrated with anti-tuberculosis treatment for suspicious tuberculous meningitis. NGS of CSF (the Vision Medical Research Institute) detected specific sequences of VZV in the 4 cases within 72 h after admission. The inappropriate treatment were stopped while acyclovir were continued intravenously for 10-14 days. All patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS VZV is an infectious agent that causes aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent adults and could not be accompanied by skin manifestations.

The sample size is 216 respondents, including 144 urban residents and 66 students who lived in rural areas before entering the agricultural university. The results of the study show that an important advantage of remote work, according to students, is the ability to achieve a balance between work and personal life (52.6%).

The default nature of that consciousness was highlighted by its profound disruption during a littleknown yet core practice within Buddhist meditation traditions, jhna meditation, which explicitly requires meditators to withdraw or disengage, temporarily, from engagement with the sensory world. The default consciousness is therefore a sensorily-based consciousness. The profound effects on brain activity that were observed to result from this withdrawal highlighted just how powerfully embedded the default consciousness is, and what a significant undertaking it is to disengage the personal element. In this chapter we explore in more detail the characteristics of the DCs as it has featured in philosophic thought, in psychoanalysis and mental health, as well as in Buddhist thought and from a modern neuroscience perspective. We then compare and contrast the form of consciousness that emerges in jhana meditation, before extending the discussion to recent neuroscience models of nested hierarchies within self-organising systems and their associated Markov blankets, with implications for the forms of consciousness that may or may not arise in those systems. We also discuss briefly the outermost hierarchical system, that of planet Earth in interaction with worldwide societies, and the likely information geometries linking outer with inner.

Among adults living with diabetes, those from ethnoracial minority communitiesforeign-born, immigrant, refugee, and culturally marginalizedare at increased risk of poor health outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is actively being researched as a means of improving diabetes management and care; however, several factors may predispose AI to ethnoracial bias. To better understand whether diabetes AI interventions are being designed in an ethnoracially equitable manner, we conducted a secondary analysis of 141 articles included in a 2018 review by Contreras and Vehi entitled Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management and Decision Support: Literature Review. Two members of our research team independently reviewed each article and selected those reporting ethnoracial data for further analysis. Only 10 articles (7.1%) were ultimately selected for secondary analysis in our case study. Of the 131 excluded articles, 118 (90.1%) failed to mention participants ethnic or racial backgrounds. The included articles reported ethnoracial data under various categories, including race (n=6), ethnicity (n=2), race/ethnicity (n=3), and percentage of Caucasian participants (n=1). Among articles specifically reporting race, the average distribution was 69.5% White, 17.1% Black, and 3.7% Asian. Only 2 articles reported inclusion of Native American participants. Given the clear ethnic and racial differences in diabetes biomarkers, prevalence, and outcomes, the inclusion of ethnoracial training data is likely to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Such considerations are imperative in AI-based tools, which are predisposed to negative biases due to their black-box nature and proneness to distributional shift. Based on our findings, we propose a short questionnaire to assess ethnoracial equity in research describing AI-based diabetes interventions. At this unprecedented time in history, AI can either mitigate or exacerbate disparities in health care. Future accounts of the infancy of diabetes AI must reflect our early and decisive action to confront ethnoracial inequities before they are coded into our systems and perpetuate the very biases we aim to eliminate. If we take deliberate and meaningful steps now toward training our algorithms to be ethnoracially inclusive, we can architect innovations in diabetes care that are bound by the diverse fabric of our society.","output":"The Need for Ethnoracial Equity in Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management: Review and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increase in thrombotic and microvascular complications is emerging to be a key feature of patients with critical illness associated with COVID-19 infection. While endotheliopathy is thought to be a key factor of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, markers indicative of this process that are prognostic of disease severity have not been well-established in this patient population. Using plasma profiling of patients with COVID-19, we identified circulating markers that segregated with disease severity: markers of angiogenesis (VEGF-A, PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB/BB) were elevated in hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19 infection, while markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, FLT-3L, PAI-1) were elevated in patients with critical COVID-19 infection. In survival analysis, elevated markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, follistatin, PAI-1) were strongly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

The aims of this study were (1) to describe global and segmental myocardial work in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), (2) to assess the correlation between myocardial work and other echocardiographic parameters, and (3) to evaluate the association of myocardial work with adverse outcomes. METHODS One hundred ten patients with nonobstructive HCM (mean age, 55  15 years; 66% men), with different phenotypes (apical, concentric, and septal hypertrophy), and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were included. The following myocardial work indices were included: myocardial work index, constructive work (CW), wasted work, and cardiac efficiency. The combined end point included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, heart failure hospitalization, aborted sudden cardiac death, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. RESULTS Mean global CW (1,722  602 vs 2,274  574 mm Hg%, P < .001), global cardiac efficiency (93% [89%-95%] vs 96% [96%-97%], P < .001), and global MWI (1,534  551 vs 1,929  473 mm Hg%) were significantly reduced, while global wasted work (104 mm Hg% [66-137 mm Hg%] vs 71 mm Hg% [49-92 mm Hg%], P < .001) was increased in patients with HCM compared with control subjects. Segmental impairment in CW colocalized with maximal wall thickness (HCM phenotype), and global CW correlated with LV wall thickness (r = -0.41, P < .001), diastolic function (r = -0.27, P = .001), and QRS duration (r = -0.28, P = .001). Patients with global CW > 1,730 mm Hg% (the median value) experienced better event-free survival than those with global CW < 1,730 mm Hg% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Myocardial work, assessed noninvasively using echocardiography and blood pressure measurement, is reduced in patients with nonobstructive HCM; it correlates with maximum LV wall thickness and is significantly associated with a worse long-term outcome.","output":"Myocardial Work in Nonobstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Implications for Outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data from Chicago city in Illinois State of the U.S. was extracted to estimate the effects of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime.

This change suggested that criminal activity was substituted as most people would be staying at home with minimal surveillance of the vehicles which were parked elsewhere. On the contrary, there was an immediate increase in domestic crime from January onwards. This study aims to figure out the impact of the pandemic on changing trends in crime by running various GIS methods. As a result, monthly change of spatial pattern, change in domestic crime and motor theft, and the relationship between some socioeconomic factors and crimes were analyzed.

School closure brought about important challenges to the students' learning process. This context requires strong self-regulatory competences and agency for autonomous learning. Moreover, online remote learning was the main alternative response to classroom learning, which increased the inequalities between students with and without access to technological resources or for those with low digital literacy. All considered, to level the playing field for students without digital resources, there is an urgent need to promote self-regulatory competences through offline intervention solutions. The current paper describes a project with this purpose, using radio broadcasting and letters to reach elementary students without digital resources. Moreover, potential reach and participants' perspectives of the project implementation are presented and discussed. The project draws on a prior evidence-based story-tool intervention grounded on a self-regulated learning framework. The original intervention was set previous to the COVID-19 pandemic and was implemented in the classroom context (N = 1,103 students). Once the schools had been closed down, the mode of intervention was adapted with the collaboration of the community. Alternative solutions were developed as follows: (i) story chapters were read on the radio and students received to their homes a printed script, prompting reflection, and suggesting related activities;(ii) students were provided with the story-tool to read autonomously and received letters from the main characters of the story which included, for example, suggestions for activities and reflection. These two alternative modes of intervention delivery potentially reached 394 elementary students, including students with digital resources. Interviews conducted with a group of students were provided information about the positive aspects of these two modes of intervention delivery, perceived learning (e.g., planning), constraints, and suggestions to improve the project. The current work is likely to merit attention from researchers and educational practitioners, given the need to use offline alternatives to provide support for students without digital resources to engage in autonomous learning during the pandemic period. This project may also be used as an alternative or a complementary solution to online modality.","output":"No Children Should Be Left Behind During COVID-19 Pandemic: Description, Potential Reach, and Participants' Perspectives of a Project Through Radio and Letters to Promote Self-Regulatory Competences in Elementary School"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Variation in virulence between two bovine rotaviruses was investigated using ten female and ten male 10-day-old gnotobiotic calves of five breeds or cross breeds that were inoculated with a virulent strain or a strain of low virulence.

Virulence was associated with extensive spread of infection through the small intestine, preferential colonization of the proximal small intestine, and marked damage to enterocytes and villi. The virus of low virulence infected the proximal small intestine poorly, and although it infected more enterocytes in the mid and distal small intestine and replicated in them, causing cytopathic effects, it did not damage intestinal structure and affect function.","output":"Variation in rotavirus virulence: a comparison of pathogenesis in calves between two rotaviruses of different virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A crisis can occur with little or no warning, anywhere, and at any time. Crisis management seeks to help organizations cope with specific, unexpected, and non-routine events that create high levels of uncertainty and threat. Although the crisis management literature is plentiful regarding the business sector, little has been written on this subject when it comes to nonprofit organizations (NPOs). This article aims to identify the level of crisis management preparedness and response of the North Portugal NPOs, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, with enormous numbers of spread disease and deaths, mainly in the senior segment. A qualitative approach is developed with an exploratory and explanatory study based on six semi-structured interviews, carried on in May 2020. The findings of the study suggest that NPOs were not prepared or had any type of planning to face a crisis, and simply reacted following the guidelines of official bodies and creating contingency plans oriented by these entities. Further, this study argues that NPOs need to actively engage in everyday maintenance and updating to prevent crisis activities to build organizational security, transparency, and accountability. The study adds to previous research on crisis management on NPOs, by proposing the identification and exploration of a set of activities that accurately enables the assessment of crisis management strategies within the context of NPOs, on an emergency event.

Guidelines on telemedicine would assist healthcare providers in delivering healthcare services based on local circumstances. Objective: To explore and compare guidelines on telehealth and telemedicine in South East Asian countries. Methods: Electronic databases such as Google, PubMed, and Cochrane reviews were searched for articles using keywords such as telemedicine OR telehealth OR eHealth OR telemedis AND guidelines AND South East Asia OR Malaysia OR Singapore OR Indonesia OR Thailand OR Vietnam published up to 2020. Inclusion criteria were full articles and gray materials (i.e., policy statements, advisories, blueprints, executive summaries, and circulars) related to telemedicine guidelines. No language restrictions were imposed. Only the first 100 Google searches were included for eligibility based on its relevance to telemedicine guidelines. Exclusion criteria were abstracts, duplicate publications, blogs, news articles, promotional brochures, conference proceedings, and telemedicine projects unrelated to telemedicine guidelines. Results: A total of 62,300 articles were identified through the search engines (Google 62,203, PubMed 77, and Cochrane 20) and six articles from additional sources. Sixty-eight full-text articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but only 24 articles contained some form of guidelines on telemedicine: Indonesia (nine), Malaysia (seven), Singapore (five), Thailand (two), and Vietnam (one). There were six laws, six advisory guidelines, five policy statements, and two circulars (regulations) issued by either the Ministry of Communication and Multimedia, Ministry of Health, or Medical Councils from the respective countries. Issues addressed were clinical governance (100%); information and communication technology infrastructure (83.3%); privacy, storage, and record-keeping (77.8%, respectively); ethics and legal (77.8%); security and safety (72.2%); definitions and applications of telemedicine (72.2%); confidentiality (66.7%); licensing (66.7%); identification (55.6%); cost of information and communication technology infrastructure (55.6%); reimbursement (16.7%); mobile applications (11.1%); and feedback and choices (5.6%).

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause ?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg(2+) significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that ?1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","output":"Characterization of the Mechanical Unfolding of RNA Pseudoknots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The controversy over fairness and objectivity in the job market, due to hiring irregularities, has led to calls for transparent and fair recruitment procedures.

Although distinct in practice, they both involve the segregation of an individual for the purpose of infection prevention. Separation from loved ones, normal activities, and routines may result in dramatic, and long-lasting psychological impacts. The objective of this study is to describe and compare the psychological effect of COVID-19 isolation and quarantine.Methods: This is a cross-section retrospective cohort study. Telephone administered surveys for self-reported depression (CES-D), distress (IES-R), and perceived stigma (SS) were administered. There were 502 respondents: 301 isolated, 201 quarantined. Findings: The mean (SD) CES-D, IES-R and SS scores were 16.76 (5.65), 13.50 (14.67) and 25.29 (7.99), respectively. 40% (205/502) of participants showed clinically significant depression and less than 20% (98/502) had indications of some distress with greater depression and distress in those isolated compared to quarantined. Perceived stigma was reported by 53.4% (268/502) of participants, more prominent among those quarantined. Depression and post-traumatic stress scores were significantly higher in females, college students, those with history of mental health conditions, those knowing a COVID-19 fatality, and with social conflict. Age was a significant variable correlated with all three scales with younger participants displaying more distress, depression and stigma. Duration of segregation was significantly correlated with CES-D score showing more depressive symptoms as the duration of isolation increased. Significant predictors were age, gender, history of mental illness and COVID-19 status.Interpretation: Isolated and quarantined individuals reported depression, perceived stigma and to a lesser extent, distress.

Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the ratio and expression of CD4 and CD8 markers in COVID-19 patients to clarify the immune characterizations of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in COVID-19 patients. Methods Peripheral blood samples of 25 COVID-19 patients and 25 normal individuals with similar age and sex as the control group were collected. White blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes were counted and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results The number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets were reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P > 0.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion Although, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals.

We investigated whether there is a genotype-specific response to treatment with a longacting beta2 agonist in combination with inhaled corticosteroid. METHODS In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients with moderate asthma were enrolled in pairs matched for forced expiratory volume in 1 s and ethnic origin, according to whether they had the B16 Arg/Arg (n=42) or B16 Gly/Gly (n=45) genotype. Individuals in a matched pair were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive inhaled longacting beta2 agonist (salmeterol 50 microg twice a day) or placebo given in a double-blind, crossover design for two 18-week periods. Open-label inhaled corticosteroid (hydrofluoroalkane beclometasone 240 microg twice a day) was given to all participants during the treatment periods. The primary endpoint was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00200967. FINDINGS After 18 weeks of treatment, mean morning PEF in Arg/Arg participants was 21.4 L/min (95% CI 11.8-31.1) higher when participants were assigned to receive salmeterol than when assigned to receive placebo (p<0.0001). In Gly/Gly participants, morning PEF was 21.5 L/min (11.0-32.1) higher when participants were assigned to receive salmeterol than when assigned to receive placebo (p<0.0001). The improvement in PEF did not differ between genotypes (difference [Arg/Arg-Gly/Gly] -0.1, -14.4 to 14.2; p=0.99). In Gly/Gly participants, methacholine PC20 (20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s; a prespecified secondary outcome) was 2.4 times higher when participants were assigned to salmeterol than when assigned to placebo (p<0.0001). Responsiveness to methacholine did not differ between salmeterol and placebo in Arg/Arg participants (p=0.87). The 2.5 times higher genotype-specific difference in responsiveness to methacholine was significant (1.32 doubling dose difference between genotypes, 0.43-2.21, p=0.0038). Seven Arg/Arg participants (placebo, n=5; salmeterol, n=2) and six Gly/Gly participants (placebo, n=3; salmeterol, n=3) had an asthma exacerbation. Five serious adverse events were reported, one each during the pre-match and run-in phases on open-label inhaled corticosteroid, two during double-blind treatment with salmeterol/inhaled corticosteroid, and one during double-blind treatment with placebo/inhaled corticosteroid. None of the serious events was asthma-related or related to study drugs or procedures. INTERPRETATION In asthma patients with B16 Arg/Arg and B16 Gly/Gly genotypes, combination treatment with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroid improved airway function when compared with inhaled corticosteroid therapy alone. These findings suggest that patients should continue to be treated with longacting beta2 agonists plus moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids irrespective of B16 genotype. Further investigation is needed to establish the importance of the genotype-specific difference in responsiveness to methacholine.

In this article, we revisit recent research on estimands and handling of missing values, especially the ICH E9 (R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Based on an in-depth discussion of the strategies for handling ICEs using a causal inference framework, we suggest some improvements in applying the estimand and estimation framework in ICH E9 (R1). Specifically, we discuss a mix of strategies allowing us to handle ICEs differentially based on reasons for ICEs. We also suggest ICEs should be handled primarily by hypothetical strategies and provide examples of different hypothetical strategies for different types of ICEs as well as a road map for estimation and sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the proposed framework helps streamline translating clinical objectives into targets of statistical inference and automatically resolves many issues with defining estimands and choosing estimation procedures arising from events such as the pandemic.","output":"Implementation of ICH E9 (R1): A Few Points Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, case reports have been published where patients with severe asthma using biological agents survived with a mild course of illness and encouraged the continuation of biological therapies in patients with severe asthma.

Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral augmentation interventions. RESULTS The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon. CONCLUSIONS Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.","output":"Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a significant increase in the number of patients requiring relatively prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and an associated surge in patients who need a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from respiratory support. In parallel, there has been a global increase in guidance from professional bodies representing staff who care for patients with tracheostomies at different points in their acute hospital journey, rehabilitation and recovery. Of concern are the risks to healthcare staff of infection arising from tracheostomy insertion and caring for patients with a tracheostomy. Hospitals are also facing extraordinary demands on critical care services such that many patients who require a tracheostomy will be managed outside established intensive care or head and neck units and cared for by staff with little tracheostomy experience. These concerns led NHS England and NHS Improvement to expedite the National Patient Safety Improvement Programme's 'Safe Tracheostomy Care' workstream as part of the NHS COVID-19 response. Supporting this workstream, UK stakeholder organisations involved in tracheostomy care were invited to develop consensus guidance based on: expert opinion; the best available published literature; and existing multidisciplinary guidelines. Topics with direct relevance for frontline staff were identified. This consensus guidance includes: infectivity of patients with respect to tracheostomy indications and timing; aerosol-generating procedures and risks to staff; insertion procedures; and management following tracheostomy.","output":"Multidisciplinary guidance for safe tracheostomy care during the COVID-19 pandemic: the NHS National Patient Safety Improvement Programme (NatPatSIP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Global research is running towards to find a vaccine to stop the threat of the COVID-19. The Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG) vaccine that prevents severe forms of tuberculosis is getting more attention in this scenario. The objective of our study was to determine the association between BCG vaccine coverage and incidence of COVID-19 at a national-level across the Globe. METHODS: The data of 160 countries were included in the study. Meta-regression was done to estimate the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 cases between countries with BCG vaccination coverage. BCG coverage was categorized as 70%, >70% and no vaccination. The analyses were carried out by adjusting for factors such as population density, income group, latitude, and percentage of the total population under age groups 15C64 and above 65 years of each country. RESULTS: The countries that had 70% coverage of BCG vaccine reported 6.5 (95% CI: ?8.4 to ?4.5) less COVID-19 infections per 10,000 population as compared to countries that reported no coverage. Those that had >70% coverage reported 10.1 (95% CI: ?11.4 to ?8.7) less infections per 10,000 population compared to those with no BCG countries. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that BCG is associated with reduced COVID-19 infections if the BCG vaccine coverage is over 70%. The region-wise analyses also suggested similar findings, except the Middle East and North African region.","output":"Is BCG associated with reduced incidence of COVID-19?

Asthmatics display different phenotypes with distinct genetic components, environmental causes, and immunopathologic signatures, and are broadly characterized into type 2-high or type 2-low (non-type 2) endotypes by linking clinical characteristics, steroid responsiveness, and molecular pathways. Regardless of asthma severity and adequate disease management, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control, often triggered by respiratory infections. The interferon (IFN) family represents a group of cytokines that play a central role in the protection against and exacerbation of various infections and pathologies, including asthma. Type I and III IFNs in particular play an indispensable role in the host immune system to fight off pathogens, which seems to be altered in both pediatric and adult asthmatics. Impaired IFN production leaves asthmatics susceptible to infection and with uncontrolled type 2 immunity, promotes airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and inflammation which can lead to asthma exacerbations. However, IFN deficiency is not observed in all asthmatics, and alterations in IFN expression may be independent of type 2 immunity. In this review, we discuss the link between type I and III IFNs and asthma both in general and in specific contexts, including during viral infection, co-infection, and bacterial/fungal infection. We also highlight several studies which examine the potential role for type I and III IFNs as asthma-related therapies.","output":"Insights Into Type I and III Interferons in Asthma and Exacerbations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Containment measures employed during the COVID-19 pandemic included prompt recognition of cases, isolation, and contact tracing. Bilateral nasal (NA) swabs applied to a commercial antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) offer a simpler and more comfortable alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) collection;however, little is known about the sensitivity of this method in an asymptomatic population. Participants in community-based asymptomatic testing sites were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using an Ag-RDT with NP sampling. Positive individuals returned for confirmatory molecular testing and consented to repeating the Ag-RDT using a bilateral NA swab for comparison. Residual test buffer (RTB) from Ag-RDTs was subjected to real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Of 123,617 asymptomatic individuals, 197 NP Ag-RDT-positive participants were included, with 175 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. Of these cases, 154 were identified from the NA swab collection with Ag-RDT, with a sensitivity of 88.0% compared to the NP swab collection. Stratifying results by RT-PCR cycle threshold demonstrated that sensitivity of the nasal collection method varied based on the cycle threshold (C-T) value of the paired RT-PCR sample. RT-PCR testing on the RTB from the Ag-RDT using NP and NA swab collections resulted in 100.0% and 98.7% sensitivity, respectively. NA swabs provide an adequate alternative to NP swab collection for use with Ag-RDT, with the recognition that the test is most sensitive in specimens with high viral loads. With the high sensitivity of RT-PCR testing on RTB from Ag-RDT, a more streamlined approach to confirmatory testing is possible without recollection or use of paired collections strategies.

Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA viruses.","output":"Assembly of alphavirus replication complexes from RNA and protein components in a novel trans-replication system in mammalian cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Intestinal ischemia (II) is the most critical factor to determine in patients with incarcerated groin hernia (IGH) because II could be reversible, and it is considered as a time sensitive condition. Although predictive factors of II were identified in several previous studies, preoperative diagnosis of II cannot be reliably made or excluded by any known parameter. The aims of this study were: to devise and to validate a clinic-biologic score, with a strong discriminatory power, for predicting the risk of II in patients with IGH. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective bicentric study including 335 patients with IGH. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictive factors of II. We assigned points for the score according to the regression coefficient. The area under the curve (AUC) was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The scoring system was then prospectively validated on a second independent population of 45 patients admitted for IGH in the same departments (internal validation). RESULTS: Four independent predictive factors of II were identified: heart rate, duration of symptoms before admission, prothrombin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). A predictive score of II was established based on these independent predictive factors. Sensitivity was 94.50%; specificity was 92.70%. The AUC of this score was 0.97. The AUC was 0.96 when the score was applied on the second population of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a score to predict the risk of intestinal II with a good accuracy (the AUC of our score was 0.97).

During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, huge amount of information is increasingly available in digital information sources and overwhelms the average person. The purpose of this research was to investigate public's information seeking behavior on COVID-19 in Greece. METHOD: The study was conducted through a web-based survey, facilitated by the use of questionnaire posted on the Google Forms platform. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended, 7-point Likert scale questions and multiple choice questions and was distributed to all over Greek Regions to almost 3.000 recipients, during the implementation of restrictive measures against the COVID-19 outbreak in Spring 2020. The data collected were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. The median was used to present the results. In order to perform analysis between genders, as well as age groups, the non-parametric criteria Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to determine the existence of differences in participants' beliefs. RESULTS: Responses by 776 individuals were obtained. Individuals dedicated up to 2 h per day to be informed on COVID-19. Television, electronic press and news websites were reported by the participants as more reliable than social media, in obtaining information on COVID-19. Respondents paid attention to official sources of information (Ministry of Health, Civil Protection etc.). Family and friends played an additional role in the participants' information on COVID-19, while the personal doctor, other health workers and pharmacists did not appear to be most preferred sources of information on COVID-19. Participants' most common information seeking strategy in digital environment was keyword searching. Unreliable information, fake news and information overload were the most common difficulties that the participants encountered seeking information on COVID-19. The respondents' views seemed to differ significantly among age groups. The older the participants, the more often they were informed by television (p < 0.001) and the less often by the internet (p < 0.001). Females appear to use more frequently internet (p < 0.001) and social media (p = 0.001) out of habit and visit more often the Ministry of Health (p < 0.001) and the Civil Protection (p=0.005) websites, compared to males. Most of the participants seemed to worry about the fake news phenomenon and agreed that fake news on COVID-19 is being spread in the media and especially social networks. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece, participants obtained information about the disease mainly by television, electronic press and news websites. On the contrary, the limited use of social media demonstrates the participants awareness of the spread of fake news on social media. This observed information seeking behavior might has contributed to individuals' acceptance of the necessary behavioral changes that had led to the Greek success story in preventing spread of the disease.","output":"Information seeking behavior and COVID-19 pandemic: A snapshot of young, middle aged and senior individuals in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin has been widely used in the management of COVID-19. However, the evidence on its actual effects remains disperse and difficult to apply in clinical settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the available evidence to date on the beneficial and adverse effects of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The PRISMA 2020 statement criteria were followed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing clinical outcomes of patients treated with and without azithromycin, indexed until 5 July 2021, were searched in PubMed, Embase, The Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MedRXivs. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled effect size from aggregate data. RESULTS: The initial search produced 4950 results. Finally, 16 studies, 5 RCTs and 11 with an observational design, with a total of 22 984 patients, were included. The meta-analysis showed no difference in mortality for those treated with or without azithromycin, in observational studies [OR: 0.90 (0.66C1.24)], RCTs [OR: 0.97 (0.87C1.08)] and also when both types of studies were pooled together [with an overall OR: 0.95 (0.79C1.13)]. Different individual studies also reported no significant difference for those treated with or without azithromycin in need for hospital admission or time to admission from ambulatory settings, clinical severity, need for intensive care, or adverse effects.

However, whether specific participatory leisure activities are associated with lower rates of depression remains unknown. We aimed to test whether engagement in a diverse range of leisure activities, all of which could involve artistic or creative elements, was associated with concurrent and subsequent depression. METHODS: Using longitudinal data from 19,134 participants aged over 50 in the Health and Retirement Study, engagement in leisure activities was measured every four years, and depression every two years, between 2008 and 2016. Leisure activities included: reading books, magazines, or newspapers; writing; baking/cooking something special; making clothes, knitting, or embroidery (sewing); working on hobbies/projects; going to sport, social, or other clubs; and attending non-religious organization meetings. A score of three or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale indicated depression. We fitted population-averaged panel data models using generalized estimating equations with a logit link. RESULTS: Engaging in some leisure activities, such as clubs, hobbies/projects, and baking/cooking was associated with reduced depression, independent of confounders. Concurrently, spending time on hobbies/projects (monthly OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.72C0.88; weekly OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.73C0.89) and clubs (monthly OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77C0.94; weekly OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69C0.88) was associated with lower odds of depression versus not engaging.

The compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Exploiting regularization theory, hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around 12% of people in Lombardy and 5% in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number is dangerously increasing in the last weeks due to holiday relax especially in the younger population and increased migrants arrival, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic, including Italy, and all could be subject to a second wave after the summer, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent another SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions to contain the spread.","output":"Tracking the time course of reproduction number and lockdown's effect during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: nonparametric estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Older adults face greater health risks due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet preventative social distancing measures may cause increased social isolation, potentially heightening risk of loneliness. In this mixed-methods study we examine changes in older adults' loneliness due to social distancing, explore variability in perceptions, and identify whether such changes differ by rurality.

Participants completed retrospective and current assessments of loneliness, including providing explanations of their responses. RESULTS: On average, loneliness increased during early social distancing, yet variability was evident. Those experiencing increased loneliness described a feeling of loss or lack of control, whereas those experiencing stability in loneliness identified adaptability in social connection modes or feeling accustomed to social isolation. Rural older adults experienced a significantly smaller increase in loneliness than their nonrural counterparts.

Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. Objective: To examine the factors associated with survey participants' self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. Results: A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10a?000 to 1 in 1a?000a?000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: -0.13 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.11]; UK: -0.04 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","output":"Factors Associated With US Adults' Likelihood of Accepting COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modelling of indicators of public programs to increase the accessibility of small business lending, in particular, the indicator of the share of state participation in this lending on the basis of establishing the conditions under which lending is attractive to small businesses An information array, needed to develop government programs to increase the accessibility of small business lending, is identified The feasibility of developing of these programs for Ukrainian small businesses, in particular, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is substantiated ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Modelling and Information Support for the Development of Government Programs to Increase the Accessibility of Small Business Lending"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oman is globally acknowledged for its well-structured immunization program with high vaccination coverage.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is traditionally used for locally advanced disease and is primarily advantageous for surgical downstaging purposes. However, it does also offer patients with certain biologic subtypes such as the triple negative or Her2 positive breast cancers the opportunity to improve survival, even in early stage disease. During the height of the pandemic, an opportunity and motivation for the increased use of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer was identified. This paper describes the conditions that have supported this practice change at the provider and institutional levels.

False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantines have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With a potential vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives will be created and, likely, adopted by large population groups, with critical consequences. Here, we analyse epidemic spreading and optimal vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in two network topologies (scale-free and small-world) assuming full adherence to vaccine administration. We consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, using a similar diffusion model as the one used in epidemics, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if an anti-vaccine narrative has a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network are more exposed and therefore are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.","output":"Vaccination strategies against COVID-19 and the diffusion of anti-vaccination views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pediatric nurses care for some of the most vulnerable patients in our healthcare system and are vulnerable to the impact of the stress of their work on their well-being. Burnout is a potential response to chronic interpersonal stressors and a negative work outcome linked to personal and professional consequences. A thorough understanding of the experience and factors associated with burnout in this population is an important part of developing interventions to mitigate or prevent this workplace outcome. Therefore, our study objectives were to: (1) explain and expand our understanding of pediatric critical care nurses experience of burnout in relation to their work environment and work engagement; (2) provide recommendations for nursing administrators to improve nurses work environment, work attitudes, and work outcomes. METHODS: A convenience sample of pediatric critical care nurses from a large pediatric quaternary care hospital in Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in this second phase of a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with and main themes and subthemes distilled through the method of interpretive description. RESULTS: A total of 18 PICU/CCCU/NICU nurses participated. Derived themes included the experience and identification of burnout, including its prevalence and elusiveness. Their experiences of quality of work-life included themes such as compensation, emotional support at work, respect, their professional identity, and spill over into home life. They discussed components of work engagement, including the work itself, investment into their growth and development, and the meaning of their work. The self-care subthemes included the importance of preparation and recovery, and the use of physical and mental separation as a preservation strategy. The participants recommendations for strategies to mitigate burnout were also summarized. CONCLUSION: Burnout is a complex and regularly occurring experience for pediatric critical care nurses. Although the experience may be difficult to self-identify, the impacts on the individuals are profound. Further research and organizational support are needed to test practical and evidence-based interventions to improve the well-being of this population.","output":"Exploring Pediatric Nurses Perspectives on Their Work Environment, Work Attitudes, and Experience of Burnout: What Really Matters?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the transient dynamics of an [Formula: see text] process on a pair of randomly coupled networks, where reactants are initially separated.

Background SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress. Case description : Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics. Conclusion Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.","output":"Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: Atypical Presentation of COVID-19 in the Young"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal is to test the validity of the Will to exist-live and survive (WTELS) as a master motivator that activates executive functions.

We evaluated the change in ETT cuff pressure by changing the position from supine to prone without head movement. METHODS Fifty-five patients were enrolled and scheduled for lumbar spine surgery. Neutral angle, which was the angle on the mandibular angle between the neck midline and mandibular inferior border, was measured. The initial neutral pressure of the ETT cuff was measured, and the cuff pressure was subsequently adjusted to 26 cmH2O. Flexed or extended angles and cuff pressure were measured in both supine and prone positions, when the patient's head was flexed or extended. Initial neutral pressure in prone was compared with adjusted neutral pressure (26 cmH2O) in supine. Flexed and extended pressure were compared with adjusted neutral pressure in supine or prone, respectively. RESULTS There were no differences between supine and prone position for neutral, flexed, and extended angles. The initial neutral pressure increased after changing position from supine to prone (26.0 vs. 31.5  5.9 cmH2O, P < 0.001). Flexed and extended pressure in supine were increased to 38.7  6.7 (P < 0.001) and 26.7  4.7 cmH2O (not statistically significant) than the adjusted neutral pressure.

Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low-resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple, scalable method to provide controlled humidity and temperature for individual N95 respirators which is easily applicable in low-resource settings. N95 respirators were subjected to moist heat (>50% relative humidity, 65C80C temperature) for over 30 minutes by placing them in a sealed container immersed in water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3C4.99 m incense particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges. This method was then repeated at a higher ambient temperature and humidity in Mumbai, using standard utensils commonly found in South Asia. Similar temperature and humidity profiles were achieved with no degradation in filtration efficiencies after 6 cycles. Higher temperatures (>70C) and longer treatment times (>40 minutes) were obtained by insulating the outer vessel. We also showed that the same method can be applied for the decontamination of surgical masks. This simple yet reliable method can be performed even without electricity access using any heat source to boil water, from open-flame stoves to solar heating, and provides a low-cost route for N95 decontamination globally applicable in resource-constrained settings.","output":"Applying heat and humidity using stove boiled water for decontamination of N95 respirators in low resource settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic review was performed to answer the following questions: 1) Do dental , oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgical procedures generate bioaerosols (and if so, which ones), which can result in transmission of COVID-19?; 2) Are aerosolized airborne droplets (and to which extent is splatter) in dental and OMF procedures infective?; 3) Is enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) an essential to prevent spreading of COVID-19 during dental and OMF aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)?

The neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in a high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S, and neutralization of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.","output":"A Replication-Competent Vesicular Stomatitis Virus for Studies of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Mediated Cell Entry and Its Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide in patients with refractory hypoxemia secondary to coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: ICUs at a large academic medical center in the United States. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight adult critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and refractory hypoxemia treated with either inhaled epoprostenol or inhaled nitric oxide for at least 1 hour between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Electronic chart review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 93 patients screened, 38 were included in the analysis, with mild (4, 10.5%), moderate (24, 63.2%), or severe (10, 26.3%), with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients were initiated on inhaled epoprostenol as the initial pulmonary vasodilator and the median time from intubation to initiation was 137 hours (68C228 h). The median change in Pao(2)/Fio(2) was 0 (C12.8 to 31.6) immediately following administration of inhaled epoprostenol. Sixteen patients were classified as responders (increase Pao(2)/Fio(2) > 10%) to inhaled epoprostenol, with a median increase in Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 34.1 (24.3C53.9). The mean change in Pao(2) and Spo(2) was C0.55  41.8 and C0.6  4.7, respectively. Eleven patients transitioned to inhaled nitric oxide with a median change of 11 (3.6C24.8) in Pao(2)/Fio(2). A logistic regression analysis did not identify any differences in outcomes or characteristics between the responders and the nonresponders. Minimal adverse events were seen in patients who received either inhaled epoprostenol or inhaled nitric oxide. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the initiation of inhaled epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide in patients with refractory hypoxemia secondary to coronavirus disease 2019, on average, did not produce significant increases in oxygenation metrics. However, a group of patients had significant improvement with inhaled epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including all patients at least 16 years old with COVID-19 who were admitted from one of five Emergency Departments between March 6th and April 4th, 2020. We included 1123 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. We analyzed white blood cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We looked at clinical outcomes including death, the need for endotracheal intubation (ETT), the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ICU admission. We report Spearman's &#961;2 and statistical significance for each correlation with outcomes. We also report positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The mean age of our patient population was 62 (SD 16). Thirty-seven percent of patients self-reported Spanish/Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, 47% reported their race as Black or African-American, and 10% reported their race as non-Hispanic white.

We show that PDGF reduces sGC expression by activating PI3K and Rac1, which in turn alters Notch ligand signaling. These data are corroborated by gene expression analysis in human atheromas, as well as immunohistological analysis of diseased and injured arteries.

METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2C90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18C39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2C17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others.

After analyzing these three moral systems, I find that beneficence lies within the very essence of humanity. Human beings are superior to other creatures in the world due to rationality and humanity. From the humanitarian ground, a common goodness lies within every human. Beneficence, as a moral principle, is derived from this inner humanity of every individual. Despite their initial differences, utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics recognize this fundamental humanitarian disposition of doing good for all as a part of being a morally better person. The principle of beneficence as I suggest, is different from its consequential utilitarian notion suggested by Mill. This version of beneficence is more credible as it does not impose excessive demands upon an individual to develop any maximum beneficial outcome following utilitarian calculation of beneficence over cost, and it also strives to overcome the rigorous duty-based theory of Kantian deontology by appealing to the fundamental virtue of humanity. Finally, the credibility of this form of beneficence comes from the underlying transcendental humanism which is the chief feature of Indian tradition.","output":"Toward a More Credible Principle of Beneficence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab is used for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy-induced CRS. Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Annunziata Hospital in Cosenza, Italy, through March 7, 2020, who received at least one dose of tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously for the treatment of COVID-19-related CRS in addition to standard care were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary observation was the incidence of grade 4 CRS after tocilizumab treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations. Findings: Twelve patients were included; all had fever, cough, and fatigue at presentation, and all had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, six patients; diabetes, five patients; chronic obstructive lung disease, four patients). Seven patients received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and five received non-invasive mechanical ventilation for lung complications of COVID-19. No incidence of grade 4 CRS was observed within 1 week of tocilizumab administration in all 12 patients (100%) and within 2 days of tocilizumab administration in 5 patients (42%). The predominant pattern on chest CT scans at presentation was ground-glass opacity, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. Follow-up CT scans 7 to 10 days after tocilizumab treatment showed improvement of lung manifestations in all patients. No adverse events or new safety concerns attributable to tocilizumab were reported. Interpretation: Tocilizumab administered subcutaneously to patients with COVID-19 and CRS is a promising treatment for reduction in disease activity and improvement in lung function. The effect of tocilizumab should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial.","output":"Subcutaneous tocilizumab treatment in patients with severe COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome: An observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, (COVID\\\\19) has had a significant impact on global health systems.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 patients and look into risk factors associated with COVID\\\\19 severity. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross\\\\sectional study that took place in two Isolation Centers in Wad Medani, Gezira State, Sudan. Four hundred and eighteen patients were included between May 2020 and May 2021. All COVID\\\\19 patients over the age of 18 who were proven COVID\\\\19 positive by nucleic acid testing or had characteristics suggestive of COVID\\\\19 on a chest CT scan and had a complete medical record in the study period were included. RESULTS: The participants in this study were 418 confirmed COVID\\\\19 cases with a median age of 66.313 years. There were 279 men (66.7%) among the patients. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (n = 195; 46.7%) and diabetes (n = 187; 44.7%).

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts.

Delta variant sublineages were grouped into seven distinct clusters of spike mutations located in N-terminal domain of S1 region (T95I, D138H, *D142G, Y145H and A222V) and S2 region (T719I and *N950D). The most predominant cluster was T95I mutation, with the highest frequencies (71.1% - 83.9%) in Wales, England and Scotland, and the least frequencies (8.9% - 12.1%) in Germany. Two mutations, *D142G and *N950D here described as *reverse mutations and T719I mutation, were largely unique to Germany. In a month, frequencies of D142G had increased from 55.6% to 67.8 % in Germany. Additionally, a cluster of D142G+T719I/T mutation went up from 27.7% to 34.1%, while a T95I+ D142G+N950D/N cluster rose from 19.2% to 26.2%.

BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to be infected and develop serious outcomes than young people. Worldwide, senior-living facilities face a battle to protect their residents. Compared with age-related declines, the built environment is more modifiable and can be used for infection control. METHODS: This research conducted content analysis of the guidelines on COVID-19 control issued by the State Council of China in February 2020 for senior-living facilities. Six senior-living facility managers in China were interviewed and shared their experiences using these guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the essential environmental factors for infection control. RESULTS: Environmental factors suggested in the guidelines were analyzed for three groups of infection-control strategies: keep COVID-19 from entering the facility, prevent COVID-19 spread in the facility, and manage infection and illness. Key topics of experience using the guidelines were identified, including residents needs for social interaction and the difficulties of providing dedicated air-conditioning and circulation systems. Based on these analyses, from the perspective of environmental design, environmental factors essential for COVID-19 control in senior-living facilities were summarized at the site, building, and room levels. CONCLUSION: Proper planning and design of the built environment promote strategies for infection control in senior-living facilities. Findings can be used to guide the new design, renovation, and modification of senior-living facilities for COVID-19 control and future public health emergencies.","output":"Use the Environment to Prevent and Control COVID-19 in Senior-Living Facilities: An Analysis of the Guidelines Used in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The threat and experience of pandemics occur differently for different groups. The rare disease population is at particular risk of being further marginalised during pandemics. In this study, our objective was to assess the hospital mortality patterns in the rare disease and the general populations during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemics in Hong Kong. METHODS: All admission records during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 23CAugust 23, 2020) and SARS pandemic (March 11CJune 30, 2003) were extracted from the local public healthcare database. Patients with rare diseases were identified using one or more of the 1084 10th version International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes cross-referenced with 467 ORPHAcodes. Hospital mortality patterns were compared in patients with and without COVID-19/SARS infection. Admission records during the same period in 2019 and 2002 were retrieved for comparison. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 407,219 patients were admitted to one or more of the 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong, of which, 13,894 were patients with rare diseases (3.4%). A total of 4381 and 77 patients from the general and rare disease populations were infected with COVID-19. Rare disease patients had an adjusted 3.4 times odds of COVID-19-related hospital mortality compared with that of the general population (95% C.I. 1.24C9.41). COVID-19-related mortality was almost exclusively seen in patients  60 years. While age-related increase in mortality was also observed for the general population during the SARS pandemic, the pattern observed in the rare disease population was significantly different, with a 12.5 times higher SARS-related mortality observed in rare disease patients  18 years than those in the general population (12.5% vs 1.0%). Patients admitted during the same pandemic periods without coronavirus infection had a significantly higher hospital mortality compared with those admitted one year before the pandemic (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This population-based study demonstrated the differential impacts of the COVID-19 and SARS pandemics on the rare disease population. In the era of budget and resource scarcity, this study warrants cautious healthcare planning, with consideration of the rare disease population in healthcare prioritisation.","output":"Hospital mortality in patients with rare diseases during pandemics: lessons learnt from the COVID-19 and SARS pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Endovascular procedures are one of the important treatment options for steno-occlusive arteries in ischemic stroke patients. However, embolic complications after such procedures are always a concern. The authors investigated the association between serial change of residual platelet reactivity and silent embolic cerebral infarction (SECI) after endovascular treatment. METHODS Ischemic stroke patients undergoing stenting of intra- or extracranial arteries were recruited prospectively. Residual platelet reactivity, represented by aspirin reaction units (ARUs) and P2Y12 reaction units (PRUs), was measured serially (6 hours before, immediately after, and 24 hours after the procedure). A loading dosage of aspirin (500 mg) and/or clopidogrel (300 mg) was given 24 hours before the procedure to patients na?ve to antiplatelet agents, whereas the usual dosage (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) was continued for patients who had previously been taking these agents for more than a week. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed before and 24 hours after the procedure to detect new SECIs. Clinical characteristics, baseline ARU and PRU values, and the change in ARU and PRU values after stenting were compared between patients with and without SECIs. RESULTS Among 69 consecutive patients who underwent neurovascular stent insertion, 41 patients (59.4%) had poststenting SECIs. The lesion was located only at the vascular territory of the stented vessel in 21 patients (51.2%), outside the stented vessel territory in 8 patients (19.5%), and both inside and outside in 12 patients (29.3%). The occurrence of SECIs was not associated with the baseline ARU or PRU value, but was associated with PRU increase after stenting (36  73 vs -12  59, p = 0.007), deployment of a longer stent (31.1  16.5 mm vs 21.8  9.9 mm, p = 0.01), and stent insertion in extracranial arteries (78.1% vs 45.2%, p = 0.008). Stent length (OR 1.066, p = 0.01) and PRU change (OR 1.009, p = 0.04) were independently associated with the occurrence of SECI. CONCLUSIONS Residual platelet reactivity after dual antiplatelet treatment measured before stenting did not predict poststenting SECI. However, the longer stent and the serial increase of PRU values after stenting were related to SECI. Continuous increase of platelet activation after endovascular procedure may be important in poststent cerebral infarction.","output":"Association between silent embolic cerebral infarction and continuous increase of P2Y12 reaction units after neurovascular stenting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may predispose patients to venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Even though the academic world is intensively pursuing new therapies, there is still no game changer in the management of COVID 19. The Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is an ancient signaling system that has been proposed as a molecular tool used by coronaviruses and other RNA and DNA viruses in order to replicate and persist in the host cell. In recent years, Intermittent Fasting (IF), a practice consisting on a strict calorie restriction during a prolonged period of time during the day, has gained popularity due to its potential benefits in multiple health systems and in regulating inflammation. IF inhibits the mTOR pathway which is similar to the effects of Rapamycin in some animal models. mTOR inhibition and promotion of autophagy could potentially be the link between the possible direct benefits of IF in COVID-19 due to the interruption of the viral cycle (protein synthesis). Besides, IF has shown to be a strong anti-inflammatory in multiple prior studies, and may play a role in attenuating COVID -19 severity. This review hypothesizes the possible intersection between viral, immunological, and metabolic pathways related to mTOR and the potential mechanisms through which IF may improve clinical outcomes. Future prospective randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate intermittent fasting (IF) regimens in order to prevent and treat moderate to severe forms of COVID-19 in humans are needed.","output":"Is there any role of intermittent fasting in the prevention and improving clinical outcomes of COVID-19?: intersection between inflammation, mTOR pathway, autophagy and calorie restriction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media facilitates rapid dissemination of information for both factual and fictional information.

Steroids are widely used to treat AD; however, they provide limited efficacy in the long term and can lead to adverse effects. Thus, novel treatments that offer durable efficacy and fewer side effects are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Huangbai Liniment (HB), a traditional Chinese medicine, using an experimental AD mouse model, following our clinical observations of AD patients. In both AD patient and the mouse disease model, HB significantly improved the disease condition. Specifically, patients who received HB treatment on local skin lesions (3C4 times/day) showed improved resolution of inflammation. Using the 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD model in BALB/c mice, we observed that HB profoundly alleviated severe skin inflammation and relieved the itching. The dermatopathological results showed markedly reversed skin inflammation with decreased epidermal thickness and overall cellularity. Correspondingly, HB treatment largely decreased the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, TNF-, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13, associated with declined gene expression of IL-33, ST2, and GATA3, which are connected to the type 2 immune response. In addition, HB restored immune tolerance by promoting regulatory T (T(REG)) cells and inhibiting the generation of T(H)1, T(H)2, and T(H)17 cells in vitro and in the DNCB-induced AD mouse model.

We analyzed the results of the epidemiology, antigenic, and genetic characteristics, and antiviral susceptibilities of seasonal influenza viruses isolated from the mainland of China during October 5, 2020 through September 5, 2021, to better assess the risk of influenza during subsequent influenza season in 2021C2022. METHODS: Positive rates of influenza virus detection during this period were based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection by the Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network laboratories, and isolated viruses from influenza positive samples were submitted to the Chinese National Influenza Center. Antigenic analyses for influenza viruses were conducted using the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Next-generation sequencing was used for genetic analyses. Viruses were tested for resistance to antiviral medications using a phenotypic assay and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: In southern China, the influenza positivity rate was elevated especially after March 2021 and was higher than the same period the previous year with the COVID-19 pandemic. In northern China, influenza positive rate peaked at Week 18 in 2021 and has declined since then. Nearly all isolated viruses were B/Victoria lineage viruses during the study period, and 37.3% of these viruses are antigenically similar to the reference viruses representing the vaccine components for the 2020C2021 and 2021C2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. All seasonal influenza viruses were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors and endonuclease inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza activity has gradually increased in the mainland of China in 2021, although the intensity of activity is still lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic. The diversity of circulating influenza types/subtypes decreased, with the vast majority being B/Victoria lineage viruses.

A backlog of elective surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an aging population, has led to substantial issues with access to timely arthroplasty surgery. A potential method to improve the efficiency of arthroplasty services is by increasing the percentage of patients who are listed for surgery from primary care referrals. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically machine learning, provides a potential unexplored solution to correctly and rapidly select suitable patients for arthroplasty surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study has 2 objectives: (1) develop a cohort of patients with referrals by general practitioners regarding assessment of suitability for hip or knee replacement from National Health Service (NHS) Grampian data via the Grampian Data Safe Haven and (2) determine the demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics that influence the selection of patients to undergo hip or knee arthroplasty, and develop a tested and validated patient-specific predictive model to guide arthroplasty referral pathways. METHODS: The AI to Revolutionise the Patient Care Pathway in Hip and Knee Arthroplasty (ARCHERY) project will be delivered through 2 linked work packages conducted within the Grampian Data Safe Haven and Safe Haven Artificial Intelligence Platform. The data set will include a cohort of individuals aged 16 years with referrals for the consideration of elective primary hip or knee replacement from January 2015 to January 2022. Linked pseudo-anonymized NHS Grampian health care data will be acquired including patient demographics, medication records, laboratory data, theatre records, text from clinical letters, and radiological images and reports. Following the creation of the data set, machine learning techniques will be used to develop pattern classification and probabilistic prediction models based on radiological images. Supplemental demographic and clinical data will be used to improve the predictive capabilities of the models. The sample size is predicted to be approximately 2000 patientsa sufficient size for satisfactory assessment of the primary outcome. Cross-validation will be used for development, testing, and internal validation. Evaluation will be performed through standard techniques, such as the C statistic (area under curve) metric, calibration characteristics (Brier score), and a confusion matrix. RESULTS: The study was funded by the Chief Scientist Office Scotland as part of a Clinical Research Fellowship that runs from August 2021 to August 2024. Approval from the North Node Privacy Advisory Committee was confirmed on October 13, 2021. Data collection started in May 2022, with the results expected to be published in the first quarter of 2024.

The PADs, also identified as point-of-care devices or health care devices have successfully applied in several fields such as diagnostics, biological, food safety, environmental, electrochemical and most importantly colorimetric/fluorimetric sensors, owing to the attractive passive motions of analyte without any external forces. In recent years, a large number of colorimetric and fluorimetric probes have been reported that can selectively recognize the analytes in PADs. However, there is no organized review on its structure-activity relationship. In this review, we have focused to summarize the colorimetric and fluorimetric probes utilized in PADs. This review discuss about the relationships between the structure and functions of various probes as signaling units of the efficient PADs. The probes including nanomaterials, nanozymes, polymers and organic molecules, their structural activity with regard to sensing performances along with their limit of detection are also discussed. This review is expected to assist readers for better understanding of the sensing mechanisms of various chemo and bio-probes utilized in PADs, as well as promote their advancement in the field. On the other hand, this review also helps the researchers for enhancement of PADs and paves way for synergistic application of existing molecular probes as an effective diagnostic tool for the worldwide pandemic novel corona virus COVID-19.","output":"Sensory materials for microfluidic paper based analytical devices - A review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir, boosted with ritonavir, has been used off-label to treat COVID-19. We aimed to synthesize the clinical evidence for lopinavir/ritonavir as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a rapid review by searching databases including PubMed, GoogleScholar, medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, for COVID-19 studies comparing outcomes between patients who did and did not receive lopinavir/ritonavir. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS: We identified five completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 retrospective cohort studies. Two large RCTs of 5,040 and 2,771 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir influenced the primary outcome of mortality, or secondary outcomes including progression to mechanical ventilation or time to discharge. Results remained similar in all sub-group analyses including by age, gender, baseline ventilation and time since symptom onset. The three smaller RCTs (n=86-199) also found no evidence of a benefit in the primary outcomes of time to clinical improvement or time to viral clearance. The 14 observational studies included between 50 and 415 participants, and were limited by a lack of adjustment for potential confounding variables. The majority of these studies found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with improved mortality or other clinical outcomes, although results regarding viral clearance were mixed.

The Generation Pup study is the first longitudinal study of dogs that recruits pure- and mixed-breed puppies, aiming to investigate the relative influence of environmental and genetic factors on a range of health and behaviour outcomes, (including separation related behaviour, aggression to familiar/unfamiliar people or dogs and obesity). This paper describes the study protocol in detail. METHODS: Prior to commencing recruitment of puppies, the study infrastructure was developed, and subject specialists were consulted to inform data collection methodology. Questionnaire content and timepoint(s) for data collection for outcomes and potential predictors were chosen with the aim of providing the best opportunity of achieving the aims of the study, subject to time and funding constraints. Recruitment of puppies (< 16 weeks, or < 21 weeks of age if entering the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland through quarantine) is underway. By 23 January 2020, 3726 puppies had been registered, with registration continuing until 10,000 puppies are recruited. Data collection encompasses owner-completed questionnaires issued at set timepoints throughout the dogs life, covering aspects such as training, diet, exercise, canine behaviour, preventative health care, clinical signs and veterinary intervention. Owners can elect to submit additional data (health cards completed by veterinary professionals, canine biological samples) and/or provide consent for access to veterinary clinical notes. Incidence and breed associations will be calculated for conditions for which there is currently limited information (e.g. separation related behaviour). Multivariable statistical analysis will be conducted on a range of outcomes that occur throughout different life stages, with the aim of identifying modifiable risk factors that can be used to improve canine health and welfare. DISCUSSION: The Generation Pup project is designed to identify associations between early-life environment, genotypic make-up and outcomes at different life stages. Modifiable risk factors can be used to improve canine health and welfare. Research collaboration with subject specialists is welcomed and already underway within the fields of orthopaedic research, epilepsy, epigenetics and canine impulsivity.

Because of this central role, enhancing land-use practices to better incorporate the needs and impacts of freight activity has strong potential to improve the efficiency of their associated supply chains. This paper summarizes the key findings of the NCFRP 08-111 project on Freight-Efficient Land Uses (FELUs), probably the most comprehensive research project to date aimed at designing policy procedures to foster land-uses that minimize the private and external costs associated with the production, transportation, and consumption of goods. As part of the paper, the authors define freight efficient land-uses, identify the principles that should guide the process towards FELUs, outline the process to develop FELU plans and programs, propose to analyze the freight efficiency of current and future land uses in their jurisdictions, and identify complementary initiatives (both land-use and transportation related) that could help mitigate the negative impacts on local communities. The authors discuss three illustrative cases that provide evidence on how land-use decisions produce unintended effects on local communities.

Health regulations indicate a limit up to 160 g/kg for OA/DTXs, PTXs or AZAs, and 3.75 mg/kg for YTXs.Argopecten purpuratus is one of the most important commercial marine products exploited in Per. Despite its importance and the periodic reports of the presence of HABs in Peruvian coastal waters, the lack of information regarding potential contamination by LMTs is noteworthy.In this work, we report a study performed with 115 samples of A. purpuratus collected between November 2013 and March 2015 from 18 scallop production areas distributed along the Peruvian coast in search of LMTs. To magnify positive results, the hepatopancreas tissue was analyzed by an LC-MS/MS method implemented to quantify OA, YTX, AZA-1, and PTX-2. Baseline separation was achieved in 19 min. The method showed satisfactory linearity (R 2 > 0.997), precision (coefficient of variation < 15 %), and limit of quantification (0.155-0.479 ng/mL). The study revealed the presence of YTX in 72 samples and of PTX-2 in 17 samples, with both biotoxins found at concentrations below the regulatory limits. Free OA and AZA-1 were not detected in any scallop sample. This atypical profile, presence of PTX-2 in the absence of OA, has been previously reported and may be linked to presence of the dinoflagellate D. acuminata . The production of YTX could be associated to the phytoplankton G. spinifera and P. reticulatum .This is the first systematic assessment of the four groups of LMTs in shellfish from Peruvian coastal waters.

Reliance on sachet water has previously been associated with the urban poor, yet recent evidence suggests a customer base which crosses socioeconomic lines. Here, we conduct a repeated cross-sectional analysis of three nationally representative datasets to examine the changing demography of sachet water consumers between 2010 and 2017. Our results show that over the course of the study period sachet water has become a ubiquitous source of drinking water in Ghana, with relatively wealthy households notably increasing their consumption. In 2017, the majority of sachet water drinking households had access to another improved water source. The current rate and form of urbanisation, inadequate water governance, and an emphasis on cost recovery pose significant challenges for the expansion of the piped water supply network, leading us to conclude that sachet water will likely continue to be a prominent source of drinking water in Ghana for the foreseeable future. The main challenge for policymakers is to ensure that the growing sachet water market enhances rather than undermines Ghanas efforts towards achieving universal and equitable access to clean drinking water and sanitation.","output":"Sachet water in Ghana: A spatiotemporal analysis of the recent upward trend in consumption and its relationship with changing household characteristics, 2010C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196/19170.].","output":"Correction: A Snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Availability up to April 2020 and its Implications: Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. Methods: A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. Results: Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. Conclusion: There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students.

Here we present the case of an adult male who suffered respiratory viral infections his whole life and developed chronic, inflammatory damage to sinuses and lungs as a consequence. Genomic sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the IFIH1 gene, encoding the protein Melanoma Differentiation Association Protein 5 (MDA5), a RIG-I-like cytoplasmic sensor of RNA intracellular infections. We show a dominant negative effect on these variants on the level of interferon-induced expression of MDA5 protein. This work supports that loss-of-function variants in IFIH1 affect the sensing of viral infections.

We now find that IL-1-induced INAVA puncta are biomolecular condensates that rapidly assemble and physiologically resolve. The condensates contain ubiquitin and the E3 ligase TrCP2, and their formation correlates with amplified ubiquitination, suggesting function in regulation of cellular proteostasis. Accordingly, a small-molecule screen identified ROS inducers, proteasome inhibitors, and inhibitors of the protein folding chaperone HSP90 as potent agonists for INAVA condensate formation. Notably, inhibitors of the p38 and mTOR pathways enhanced resolution of the condensates, and inhibitors of the Rho-ROCK pathway induced INAVA's competing function by recruiting INAVA to newly assembled intercellular junctions in cells where none existed before.","output":"Small-molecule modulators of INAVA cytosolic condensate and cell-cell junction assemblies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vor der Einfhrung von Antibiotika fhrten schwere bakterielle Infektionen wie Sepsis, Diphtherie und Meningitis fast zwangsl?ufig zum Tod.

METHODS: A search with standardized descriptors and synonyms was performed on November 28(th), 2020 of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, LILACS, and IBECS to identify studies of interest. Grey literature searches and snowballing techniques were additionally utilized to identify yet-unpublished works and related citations. Two review authors independently screened the retrieved titles and abstracts, selected eligible studies for inclusion, extracted data from the included studies, and then assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Eligible studies were those including laboratory parametersincluding serum interleukin-6 levelsfrom mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases. Laboratory parameters, such as interleukin-6, ferritin, hematology, C-Reactive Protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and D-dimer, were extracted from the studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using the laboratory data to estimate mean differences with associated 95% confidence intervals. DATA SYNTHESIS: The database search yielded 9,620 records; 40 studies (containing a total of 9,542 patients) were included in the final analysis. Twenty-one studies (n = 4,313) assessed laboratory data related to severe COVID-19 cases, eighteen studies (n = 4,681) assessed predictors for fatal COVID-19 cases and one study (n = 548) assessed laboratory biomarkers related to severe and fatal COVID-19 cases. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of interleukin-6, ferritin, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, C-Reactive-Protein, procalcitonin, creatinine, neutrophils and leucocytes were associated with severe and fatal COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: This review points to interleukin-6, ferritin, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-Reactive Protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and D-dimer as important biomarkers of cytokine storm syndrome.

Around 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+ve), with tamoxifen being most commonly used as an adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence and metastasis. However, half of the patients will eventually develop tamoxifen resistance. The overexpression of c-MYC can drive the development of ER+ve breast cancer and confer tamoxifen resistance through multiple pathways. One key mechanism is to enhance ribosome biogenesis, synthesising mature ribosomes. The over-production of ribosomes sustains the demand for proteins necessary to maintain a high cell proliferation rate and combat apoptosis induced by therapeutic agents. c-MYC overexpression can induce the expression of eIF4E that favours the translation of structured mRNA to produce oncogenic factors that promote cell proliferation and confer tamoxifen resistance. Either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated eIF4E can mediate such an effect. Since ribosomes play an essential role in c-MYC-mediated cancer development, suppressing ribosome biogenesis may help reduce aggressiveness and reverse tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. CX-5461, CX-3543 and haemanthamine have been shown to repress ribosome biogenesis. Using these chemicals might help reverse tamoxifen resistance in ER+ve breast cancer, provided that c-MYC-mediated ribosome biogenesis is the crucial factor for tamoxifen resistance. To employ these ribosome biogenesis inhibitors to combat tamoxifen resistance in the future, identification of predictive markers will be necessary.","output":"Targeting Ribosome Biogenesis to Combat Tamoxifen Resistance in ER+ve Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To ascertain ophthalmologists perceptions about webinars as a method of continued medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Though LCS may be associated with better outcomes for non-Hispanic Black individuals, it is unknown whether racial or ethnic disparities exist in LCS use. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether health status is associated with LCS and whether racial or ethnic disparities are associated with LCS independently of health status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, population-based study of community-dwelling US adults used data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System annual surveys, 2017 to 2020. Participants were aged 55 to 79 years, with a less than 30 pack-year smoking history, and were current smokers or those who quit within 15 years. Data were analyzed from August to November 2021. EXPOSURES: Self-reported health status and race and ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported LCS in the last 12 months. RESULTS: Of 14 550 individuals (7802 men [55.5%]; 7527 [55.0%] aged 65-79 years [percentages are weighted]), representing 3.68 million US residents, 17.0% (95% CI, 15.1%-18.9%) reported undergoing LCS. The prevalence of LCS was lower among non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White individuals but not to a significant degree (12.0% [95% CI, 4.3%-19.7%] vs 17.5% [95% CI, 15.6%-19.5%]; P = .57). Health status was associated with LCS: 468 individuals in poor health vs 96 individuals in excellent health reported LCS (25.2% [95% CI, 20.6%-29.9%] vs 7.6% [95% CI, 5.0%-10.3%]; P < .001), and those with difficulty climbing stairs were more likely to report LCS than those without this functional limitation. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors, functional status, and comorbidities, self-rated health status remained associated with LCS (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 per each 1-step decline in health; 95% CI, 1.03-1.38), and non-Hispanic Black individuals were 53% less likely to report LCS than non-Hispanic White individuals (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.90). Results were robust in sensitivity analyses in which health was alternatively quantified as number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: LCS in the US is more common among those who may be less likely to benefit from screening because of poor underlying health. Furthermore, racial or ethnic disparities were evident after accounting for health status, with non-Hispanic Black individuals nearly half as likely as non-Hispanic White individuals to report LCS despite the potential for greater benefit of screening this population.","output":"Likelihood of Lung Cancer Screening by Poor Health Status and Race and Ethnicity in US Adults, 2017 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, represents an unprecedented challenge for healthcare. COVID-19 features a state of hyperinflammation resulting in a cytokine storm, which leads to severe complications, such as the development of micro-thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing daily: as of June 12th, over 7.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 420,000 global deaths. Over 3.5 million patients have recovered from COVID-19; although this number is increasing by the day, great attention should be directed towards the possible long-term outcomes of the disease. Despite being a trivial matter for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), erectile dysfunction (ED) is a likely consequence of COVID-19 for survivors, and considering the high transmissibility of the infection and the higher contagion rates among elderly men, a worrying phenomenon for a large part of affected patients. METHODS: A literature research on the possible mechanisms involved in the development of ED in COVID-19 survivors was performed. RESULTS: Endothelial dysfunction, subclinical hypogonadism, psychological distress and impaired pulmonary hemodynamics all contribute to the potential onset of ED. Additionally, COVID-19 might exacerbate cardiovascular conditions; therefore, further increasing the risk of ED. Testicular function in COVID-19 patients requires careful investigation for the unclear association with testosterone deficiency and the possible consequences for reproductive health.

Due to COVID-19 outcome heterogeneity, accurate assessment of pts is crucial. Early identification of pts who are likely to deteriorate allows timely discussions regarding escalation of care. Likewise, safe home management will reduce risk of nosocomial infection. To aid clinical decisionmaking, we developed a model to help determine which pts should be admitted vs. managed as an outpatient and which pts are likely to have severe COVID-19. Methods: Pts with active solid or haematological cancer presenting with symptoms/asymptomatic and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and USA were identified following institutional board approval. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from pt records. Clinical outcome measures were discharge within 24 hours, requirement for oxygen at any stage during admission and death. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used for model derivation as it compared favourably vs. lasso regression. Relevant clinical features were identified using recursive feature elimination based on SHAP. Internal validation (bootstrapping) with multiple imputations for missing data (maximum 2) were used for performance evaluation. Cost function determined cut-offs were defined for admission/death. The final CORONET model was trained on the entire cohort. Results: Model derivation set comprised 672 pts (393 male, 279 female, median age 71). 83% had solid cancers, 17% haematological. Predictive features were selected based on clinical relevance and data availability, supported by recursive feature elimination based on SHAP.

Nucleic acid amplification serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, challenges faced for diagnostic laboratories from undeveloped countries includes shortage of kits and supplies to purify viral RNA. Therefore, it is urgent to validate alternative nucleic acid isolation methods for SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrate that a concentrated viral lysis amplification buffer (vLAB) prepared with the nonionic detergent IGEPAL enables qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 by direct Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (dRT-PCR). Furthermore, vLAB was effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Since this method is inexpensive and no RNA purification equipment or additional cDNA synthesis is required, this dRT-PCR with vLAB should be considered as an alternative method for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Direct RT-PCR amplification of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using a concentrated viral lysis-amplification buffer prepared with IGEPAL-630"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two models consisting of 469 atoms each one, for the interaction between the N3 inhibitor and the main protease of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV M pro ) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 M pro ) viruses, were used to reveal by quantum chemistry methods the non-covalent interactions involved in these systems. Through the Density Functional Theory and the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules the main conclusion reached by this study indicates that C-H  O and C-H  H hydrogen bonds are crucial to describe attractive interactions in these complexes. In general, these contacts are overlooked in many studies. However, these non-conventional hydrogen bonds represent more than a half of the energy interaction estimated for non-covalent contacts. These results are quite important for the design of new drugs since these interactions could drive the action mechanisms against these viruses.

This paper presents findings related to the universe of people who called the toll-free service, from the sociocultural characteristics of the users to the information collected by the professionals during the psychological pathways until human satisfaction was achieved. We provide a retrospective description of an experience that took place between April and June 2020, and which involved users of the maternal-infant area calling from the whole Italy. (1) Methods: The aims of this study were to investigate the configuration of the indicators identified and to detect the possible correlations between them in the sample. There were 193 users who took advantage of the Service, 160 of whom continued beyond the reception service; it is this group that we report the findings from here. The tool used was a form reporting access to care and interventions, and the resulting data underwent a content analysis and the indicators were subject to non-parametric statistical analysis to analyze differences and relationships. (2) Results: There were many correlations among the indicators that revealed a high prevalence of calls due to personal motivations and requests for support, which later allowed users to gain a greater understanding of the underlying problems they were facing. The professionals running the service noticed a prevalence of weaknesses attributable to the negative emotions of its users, alongside a presence of cognitive and relational resources. The professionals interventions, which can be characterized by a prevalence of social support, psychological rehabilitation, and psychoeducation, achieved outcomes of redefining users relationships with themselves and others. All of the services users have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it. (3) Discussion: Our results revealed the protective and transformative effects of the service for its users and the underlying importance of having an easily accessible psychological support system in place during emergencies, like the recent pandemic. In conditions like these, the great value of a remote support service should be noted, and despite its limitations, assures its own efficacy when a medical emergency precludes closer in-person forms of psychological assistance.","output":"The Lgami/Legmi ServiceAn Experience of Psychological Intervention in Maternal and Child Care during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affected over 130 million individuals during more than one year.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 275 workers in 2020 in one of the industries in southern Iran. To gather the data, demographic, researcher-made, standard hypochondria, and job stress questionnaires were sent electronically along with a guide and study objectives. The participants completed the questionnaires during 2 weeks and send them electronically to the research team. Finally, data were analyzed using tests of one-way ANOVA and linear regression in SPSS software version 22. Results: The results showed that the mean score of hypochondriasis in different groups of variables, including age, work experience, use of personal protective equipment, corona experience, and attention to preventive measures was significantly different (p<0.05). Based on the results, the mean score of job stress significantly differed in different groups of variables of personal protective equipment use, corona experience, and awareness on corona (p<0.05). Moreover, based on the regression relationships, hypochondriasis could be predicted by variables of personal protective equipment, corona experience, awareness on corona, and attention to preventive measures; and job stress could be predicted by variables of awareness on corona and attention to preventive measures.

This study was aimed at the preliminary operative assessment of changes in the structure and collective dose from CT examinations in several representative hospitals, regions and on the level of the Russian Federation. The results of the study indicate that during the transformation of hospitals from general medical practice into dedicated COVID-19 facilities, the number of CT examinations increased up to 30%; the collective dose from CT exams increased up to a factor of 1.5. During a partial transformation of a medical facility into the hospital with separate COVID-19 departments, the increase in the number of CT examinations in the facility was more significant (up to a factor of 2 or more). These numbers correspond to 1.5 - 2.5 chest CT examinations (from 1 to 6) per patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19 diagnosis; and 1.2 chest CT examinations per patient in outpatient facilities, including a mandatory CT scan for the staging of COVID-19. The collective dose from CT examinations in the Russian Federation for March-June period of 2020 increased by the factor of 2 (from 16k man-Sv to 32k man-Sv); the collective dose of COVID-19 patients was about 12k man-Sv.

In this study, we assess the actual dermal exposure of the hands of pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel in a panel of hospitals performing tasks that pose a risk of exposure. We compare the dermal exposure to a tentative limit value for cyclophosphamide. Pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel were asked for hand rinsing after performance of nine tasks previously identified as posing a risk of occupational exposure. All samples were analyzed for the presence and quantity of eight antineoplastic drugs. By using data on both the frequency of the performance of the tasks and the measured dermal contamination during these tasks, weekly exposure to the marker drug (cyclophosphamide) was calculated. In five Dutch hospitals, 70 hand rinse samples and 8 blanks were collected. These were analyzed and results were used to calculate weekly exposure. The tentative limit value used was 0.74 g of cyclophosphamide. For cleaning personnel, all results remained below this threshold value. For pharmacy technicians, the compounding itself also remained well below the limit; however, the task involving preparatory work, as well as the checking of compounded drugs, had a 13% chance of exceeding the limit. All of the highest values were found when employees were not wearing gloves on these tasks. Cleaning personnel and pharmacy technicians compounding cytotoxic drugs in our study were sufficiently protected from occupational exposure. In contrast, pharmacy technicians who perform preparatory and finishing tasks (before and after the actual compounding) are not protected enough when they do not wear gloves.","output":"Occupational exposure of pharmacy technicians and cleaning staff to cytotoxic drugs in Dutch hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning techniques have been employed to predict the glass densities of xBi(2)O(3)C(70 ? x)B(2)O(3)C20Li(2)OC5Sb(2)O(3)C5ZnO glasses using a data set of 2000 various B(2)O(3) rich glasses using their chemical composition and ionic radius.

Recently, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence of band topology has been extended to higher-order cases that enable explorations of topological states with codimensions larger than one such as hinge and corner states. Here, we demonstrate a higher-order quantum spin Hall effect in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Owing to the non-trivial higher-order topology and the pseudospin-pseudospin coupling, we observe a directional localization of photons at corners with opposite pseudospin polarizations through pseudospin-momentum-locked edge waves, resembling the quantum spin Hall effect in a higher-order manner. Our work inspires an unprecedented route to transport and trap spinful waves, supporting potential applications in topological photonic devices such as spinful topological lasers and chiral quantum emitters.","output":"Higher-order quantum spin Hall effect in a photonic crystal."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can induce serious complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and acute kidney injury.

Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge.

The purpose of this study was to describe changes in the weight-related behaviors of children with obesity after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Semistructured interviews (n = 51) were conducted from April to June 2020 with parents of children with obesity. Families were participants in a randomized trial testing a clinic-community pediatric obesity treatment model. During interviews, families described their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on children's diet, physical activity, sleep, and screen time behaviors. Rapid qualitative analysis methods were used to identify themes around changes in children's weight-related behaviors. Results: The mean child age was 9.7 (2.8) years and the majority of children were Black (46%) or Hispanic (39%) and from low-income families (62%). Most parent participants were mothers (88%). There were differences in the perceived physical activity level of children, with some parents attributing increases in activity or maintenance of activity level to increased outdoor time, whereas others reported a decline due to lack of outdoor time, school, and structured activities. Key dietary changes included increased snacking and more meals prepared and consumed at home. There was a shift in sleep schedules with children going to bed and waking up later and an increase in leisure-based screen time.

A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis confirmed the binding activity of RBD-C9R with ACE2, the host cells receptor. In addition, RBD-C9R elicited a Th-2 immune response with a high IgG titer in Jcl: ICR mice. The RBD-C9R antisera interacted with both itself and the mammalian-cell expressed spike protein (S1), as demonstrated by ELISA, indicating that the E. coli expressed RBD-C9R harbors native-like epitopes. Overall, these results emphasize the potential of our SEP-tag for the E. coli production of active multi-disulfide-bonded RBD.","output":"A Multi-Disulfide Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Expressed in E. coli Using a SEP-Tag Produces Antisera Interacting with the Mammalian Cell Expressed Spike (S1) Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New heart failure therapies that safely augment cardiac contractility and output are needed. Previous apelin peptide studies have highlighted the potential for APJ (apelin receptor) agonism to enhance cardiac function in heart failure. However, apelins short half-life limits its therapeutic utility. Here, we describe the preclinical characterization of a novel, orally bioavailable APJ agonist, BMS-986224. METHODS: BMS-986224 pharmacology was compared with (Pyr(1)) apelin-13 using radio ligand binding and signaling pathway assays downstream of APJ (cAMP, phosphorylated ERK [extracellular signal-regulated kinase], bioluminescence resonance energy transferCbased G-protein assays, -arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization). Acute effects on cardiac function were studied in anesthetized instrumented rats. Chronic effects of BMS-986224 were assessed echocardiographically in the RHR (renal hypertensive rat) model of cardiac hypertrophy and decreased cardiac output. RESULTS: BMS-986224 was a potent (Kd=0.3 nmol/L) and selective APJ agonist, exhibiting similar receptor binding and signaling profile to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. G-protein signaling assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and human cardiomyocytes confirmed this and demonstrated a lack of signaling bias relative to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. In anesthetized instrumented rats, short-term BMS-986224 infusion increased cardiac output (10%C15%) without affecting heart rate, which was similar to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13 but differentiated from dobutamine. Subcutaneous and oral BMS-986224 administration in the RHR model increased stroke volume and cardiac output to levels seen in healthy animals but without preventing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, effects differentiated from enalapril. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a novel, potent, and orally bioavailable nonpeptidic APJ agonist that closely recapitulates the signaling properties of (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. We show that oral APJ agonist administration induces a sustained increase in cardiac output in the cardiac disease setting and exhibits a differentiated profile from the renin-angiotensin system inhibitor enalapril, supporting further clinical evaluation of BMS-986224 in heart failure.","output":"In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of a Small-Molecule APJ (Apelin Receptor) Agonist, BMS-986224, as a Potential Treatment for Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present COVID-CT-Mask-Net model that predicts COVID-19 in chest CT scans.

The hypothesis was that less investment in the public health system, the number of doctors per inhabitant and the number of hospital beds available to the population led to a higher number of deaths after the arrival of COVID-19 in each country studied. The objective was to analyze the relationship between the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the global pandemic declared since December 2019 and health policies and investment in European countries. METHODS A research study was conducted in which a total of six variables were analyzed with official and contrasted data: public health expenditure per capita; doctors per 1,000 inhabitants; number of beds per 1,000 people; deaths from COVID-19 per million inhabitants; number of tests to detect COVID-19 per 1,000 inhabitants; and GINI Coefficient to measure the degree of social inequality in each country. It was carried out in 30 European countries. Frequency and correlation analyses were carried out (Pearson). RESULTS Five countries were found, which gave values above 300 deaths per million (data from April 27, 2020): United Kingdom; (305.39), France (350.16), Italy (440.67), Spain (495.99) and Belgium (612.1). Precisely, in the countries that recorded the most deaths (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium) on April 27, we did not find high values of TEST performance. In our analysis, we found that the lower the investment of public spending in health (per capita), the higher the number of deaths per COVID-19 per million inhabitants, the lower the coverage of hospital beds, and the lower the number of doctors. Finally, we found that the lower the expenditure on public health, the higher the GINI coefficient (thus greater social inequality). CONCLUSIONS A negative effect in terms of deaths was detected when investment in public health was lower; the higher number of deaths from COVID-19 was correlated (p<0.005) with greater social inequality (GINI coefficient) and with lower investment in public health (p<0.001); this had an impact on the lower number of available beds and low physician coverage per 1,000 inhabitants.","output":"[COVID-19, neoliberalism and health systems in 30 european countries: relationship to deceases.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first Indian cases of COVID-19 caused by SARS-Cov-2 were reported in February 29, 2020 with a history of travel from Wuhan, China and so far above 4500 deaths have been attributed to this pandemic.

We evaluated the impact of N501Y on neutralizing activity of COVID-19 convalescent sera and on anti-RBD IgG assays. METHODS: The susceptibility to neutralization by COVID-19 patients convalescent sera from Hong Kong were compared between two SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B117-1/B117-2) from the  variant with N501Y and 4 non-N501Y isolates. The effect of N501Y on antibody binding was assessed. The performance of commercially-available IgG assays was determined for patients infected with N501Y variants. FINDINGS: The microneutralization antibody (MN) titers of convalescent sera from 9 recovered COVID-19 patients against B117-1 (geometric mean titer[GMT],80; 95% CI, 47C136) were similar to those against the non-N501Y viruses. However, MN titer of these serum against B117-2 (GMT, 20; 95% CI, 11C36) was statistically significantly reduced when compared with non-N501Y viruses (P < 0.01; one-way ANOVA). The difference between B117-1 and B117-2 was confirmed by testing 60 additional convalescent sera. B117-1 and B117-2 differ by only 3 amino acids (nsp2-S512Y, nsp13-K460R, spike-A1056V). Enzyme immunoassay using 272 convalescent sera showed reduced binding of anti-RBD IgG to N501Y or N501Y-E484K-K417N when compared with that of wild-type RBD (mean difference: 0.1116 and 0.5613, respectively; one-way ANOVA). Of 7 anti-N-IgG positive sera from patients infected with N501Y variants (collected 9-14 days post symptom onset), 6 (85.7%) tested negative for a commercially-available anti-S1-IgG assay. INTERPRETATION: We highlighted the importance of using a panel of viruses within the same lineage to determine the impact of virus variants on neutralization. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of the potential reduced sensitivity of anti-RBD IgG assays.","output":"The impact of spike N501Y mutation on neutralizing activity and RBD binding of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Question answering can be described as retrieving relevant information for questions expressed in natural language, possibly also generating a natural language answer.

However, there are pediatric inflammatory conditions that have also been encountered. The aim of this report is to determine whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and severe infections in the ear, nose, throat, and deep cervical area (ENT) in pediatric populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compilation was made of all the cases of ENT area infections in the pediatric population per month attended to at the Ni?o Jess University Children's Hospital from January 2010 to June 2020. Endemic channels and dispersion analysis were designed to analyze the incidence presented in the year 2020, compared to what was expected based on historical data from 2010 to 2019. Then, an epidemiological interview was conducted of the close contacts of COVID-19 of the children who presented a severe ENT infection in 2020. Finally, a serological test of IgG antibodies was performed on all of them to find out if they had overcome the COVID- 19. RESULTS: 620 patients from 1022 were eligible for the study. We observed a significant outbreak in the incidence of complicated mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the year 2020 (13 patients) linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. From these patients, 54% had been confirmed or had high suspicion of close contact with COVID-19. 15.4% of children were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the first four months of 2020, which constitutes an outbreak. A considerable number (54%) of these complicated infections were related to close contact with COVID-19. Still, only 15.4% were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies, so we cannot establish a direct categorical relationship.

SUMMARY: As interest in genomic testing grows, pharmacists have the opportunity to advance the use of PGx in EHPs, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. In November 2018, a pharmacist-provided PGx service was established in the EHP at the University of Colorado Hospital. The team members included 3 physicians, a pharmacist trained in PGx, a registered dietitian/exercise physiologist, a nurse, and 2 medical assistants. We conducted 4 preimplementation steps: (1) assessment of the patient population, (2) selection of a PGx test, (3) establishment of a visit structure, and (4) selection of a billing model. The PGx consultations involved two 1-hour visits. The first visit encompassed pretest PGx education, review of the patient's current medications and previous medication intolerances, and DNA sample collection for genotyping. After this visit, the pharmacist developed a therapeutic plan based on the PGx test results, discussed the results and plan with the physician, and created a personalized PGx report. At the second visit, the pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results, personalized the PGx report, and discussed the PGx-guided therapeutic plan with the patient. Overall, the strategy worked well; minor challenges included evaluation of gene-drug pairs with limited PGx evidence, communication of information to non-EHP providers, scheduling issues, and reimbursement. CONCLUSION: The addition of a PGx service within an EHP was feasible and provided pharmacists the opportunity to lead PGx efforts and collaborate with physicians to expand the precision medicine footprint at an academic medical center.","output":"Implementation of a pharmacist-provided pharmacogenomics service in an executive health program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditionally, earthquake impact assessments have been made via fieldwork by non-governmental organisations (NGO's) sponsored data collection; however, this approach is time-consuming, expensive and often limited. Recently, social media (SM) has become a valuable tool for quickly collecting large amounts of first-hand data after a disaster and shows great potential for decision-making. Nevertheless, extracting meaningful information from SM is an ongoing area of research. This paper tests the accuracy of the pre-trained sentiment analysis (SA) model developed by the no-code machine learning platform MonkeyLearn using the text data related to the emergency response and early recovery phase of the three major earthquakes that struck Albania on the 26th November 2019. These events caused 51 deaths, 3000 injuries and extensive damage. We obtained 695 tweets with the hashtags: #Albania #AlbanianEarthquake, and #albanianearthquake from the 26th November 2019 to the 3rd February 2020. We used these data to test the accuracy of the pre-trained SA classification model developed by MonkeyLearn to identify polarity in text data. This test explores the feasibility to automate the classification process to extract meaningful information from text data from SM in real-time in the future. We tested the no-code machine learning platform's performance using a confusion matrix. We obtained an overall accuracy (ACC) of 63% and a misclassification rate of 37%.

Their diminished occurrence contrasts starkly with the robust intrinsic potential of RNA to multimerize through long-range base-pairing (kissing) interactions, self-annealing of palindromic or complementary sequences, and stable tertiary contact motifs, such as the GNRA tetraloop-receptors. To explore the general mechanics of RNA dimerization, we performed a meta-analysis of a collection of exemplary RNA homodimer structures consisting of viral genomic elements, ribozymes, riboswitches, etc., encompassing both functional and fortuitous dimers. Globally, we found that domain-swapped dimers and antiparallel, head-to-tail arrangements are predominant architectural themes. Locally, we observed that the same structural motifs, interfaces and forces that enable tertiary RNA folding also drive their higher-order assemblies. These feature prominently long-range kissing loops, pseudoknots, reciprocal base intercalations and A-minor interactions. We postulate that the scarcity of functional RNA multimers and limited diversity in multimerization motifs may reflect evolutionary constraints imposed by host antiviral immune surveillance and stress sensing. A deepening mechanistic understanding of RNA multimerization is expected to facilitate investigations into RNA and RNP assemblies, condensates, and granules and enable their potential therapeutical targeting.","output":"Structural Insights into RNA Dimerization: Motifs, Interfaces and Functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In anticipation of the impending crisis, the article considers two branches of anticrisis measures: 1) the creation of an economic structure that ensures the accelerated growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, the products of which can partially offset the loss of income from the export of hydrocarbons due to import substitution and export of manufacturing goods and services; 2) social protection of the poorest segments of the population from the possible increase in unemployment and poverty.","output":"On Urgent Socioeconomic Measures During The Corona Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We agree with the view already expressed by Glikman et al.1 that Israel has gained world leadership in technology and capacity of COVID-19 vaccination.

The aim of this study is to identify factors that affect vaccination intention among health science students, by using the health belief model (HBM) as a theoretical framework. METHODS: This study was undertaken in April 2021 using a convenience sample strategy among health science students in Tra Vinh University, which is a university in South Vietnam. Participants were required to complete the self-report questionnaire. All data were calculated by using STATA 14 software, to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, along with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of 412 eligible participants were taken part in the study, with a questionnaire response rate of 48.2%, reporting that 77.7% of participants intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccination when available. An overall score of knowledge was 7.8  1.5 (range 0C10), a positive attitude toward vaccination including perceived susceptibility and severity (3.1  0.7), perceived benefits (3.1  0.7) and cues to action (4.0  0.6). Determinants of willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccination included their field of education, knowledge and factors in HBM model including perceived susceptibility and severity, perceived benefits and cues to action (all p < 0.05). In contrast, perceived barriers had a negative association with the probability of vaccine acceptance (p < 0.05). The study did indicate a number of participants not willing to receive a vaccination due to, mainly, safety (67.4%), development issues (58.7%) and side effects (79.3%).

METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study from March 2004 to September 2005 with consecutive infants (ages 1-12 months) with severe acute bronchiolitis and considered ready to be extubated. We calculated mean airway pressure and oxygenation index. Before extubation we measured respiratory rate, tidal volume, rapid shallow breathing index, maximal inspiratory pressure, and load/force balance. Arterial blood gases were measured 1 hour before extubation. Extubation was classified as a failure if the infant needed re-intubation within 48 hours. RESULTS Extubation failure occurred in 6 (15%) of the 40 extubated infants. The respective median (and interquartile range) age, weight, and days of mechanical ventilation for the extubation-failure and extubation-success groups were: age 5 (3-8) months versus 4 (4-6) months (P = .87), weight 4 (3-5) kg versus 6 (5-7) kg (P < .001), and mechanical ventilation days 8 (6-23) d versus 6 (5-12) d (P = .52). There were no significant differences in arterial blood gas values or mechanical-ventilation parameters between the extubation-success and extubation-failure groups. There were statistically significant differences between the extubation-failure and extubation-success groups for 2 risk factors, weight <or= 4 kg and tidal volume <or= 4 mL/kg, when those risk factors had a large area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. Variables that had a large area under the curve were minute volume <or= 0.8 mL/kg/min and maximal inspiratory pressure <or= 50 cm H(2)O. Variables that had a small area under the curve were load/force balance >or= 5 and rapid shallow breathing index >or= 6.7. CONCLUSIONS In infants with severe acute bronchiolitis the extubation process is complex because of the combined features of this disease. Pediatric studies have not definitely determined predictive factors, weaning protocols, or ventilatory predictive indexes of extubation failure risk in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis. Lower minute volume and lower maximal inspiratory pressure had large areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic for extubation-failure risk in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis.","output":"Risk factors for extubation failure in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 due to its rapid spread on a global scale.

METHODS: We estimated per-day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients. We used a bottom-up approach to estimate full economic costs and adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from data provided by three public COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya and augmented this with guidelines. We obtained input prices from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and from market prices for Kenya. RESULTS: Per-day, per-patient unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease under home-based care are 1993.01 Kenyan shilling (KES) (US$18.89) and 1995.17 KES (US$18.991), respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation centre or hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease are 6717.74 KES (US$63.68) and 6719.90 KES (US$63.70), respectively. Per-day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 13 137.07 KES (US$124.53) and 63 243.11 KES (US$599.51).

However, clinical features, outcomes, and predictors of mortality in SOT recipients are not well-described. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cohort study of SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected using standardized intake and 28-day follow-up electronic case report forms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the primary endpoint, 28-day mortality, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-two SOT recipients from >50 transplant centers were included: 318 (66%) kidney or kidney/pancreas, 73 (15.1%) liver, 57 (11.8%) heart, and 30 (6.2%) lung. Median age was 58 (IQR 46-57), median time post-transplant was 5 years (IQR 2-10), 61% were male, and 92% had 1 underlying comorbidity.

It is necessary to estimate the cases that might be underestimated based on county-level data, to take better countermeasures against COVID-19. We suggested taking time-varying Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models with unreported infection rates (UIR) to estimate factual COVID-19 cases in the United States. METHODS: Both the SIR model integrated with unreported infection rates (SIRu) of fixed-time effect and SIRu with time-varying parameters (tvSIRu) were applied to estimate and compare the values of transmission rate (TR), UIR, and infection fatality rate (IFR) based on US county-level COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Based on the US county-level COVID-19 data from 22 January (T1) to 20 August (T212) in 2020, SIRu was first tested and verified by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Further regression of SIRu at the county-level showed that the average values of TR, UIR, and IFR were 0.034%, 19.5%, and 0.51% respectively. The ranges of TR, UIR, and IFR for all states ranged from 0.007-0.157 (mean = 0.048), 7.31-185.6 (mean = 38.89), and 0.04-2.22% (mean = 0.22%). Among the time-varying TR equations, the power function showed better fitness, which indicated a decline in TR decreasing from 227.58 (T1) to 0.022 (T212). The general equation of tvSIRu showed that both the UIR and IFR were gradually increasing, wherein, the estimated value of UIR was 9.1 (95%CI 5.7-14.0) and IFR was 0.70% (95%CI 0.52-0.95%) at T212. INTERPRETATION: Despite the declining trend in TR and IFR, the UIR of COVID-19 in the United States is still on the rise, which, it was assumed would decrease with sufficient tests or improved countersues.

The aim of this article is to overview available evidence on the use of widely used antirheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine for additional indications. Hydroxychloroquine has endothelial stabilizing and anti-thrombotic effects. Its use has been explored as an adjunctive therapy in refractory thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome. It may also prevent recurrent pregnancy losses in the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine favourably modulates atherogenic lipid and glycaemic profiles. Methotrexate has been tried for modulation of cardiovascular events in non-rheumatic clinical conditions, although a large clinical trial failed to demonstrate a benefit. Colchicine has been shown to successfully reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in a large multicentric trial. Potential antifibrotic effects of colchicine require further exploration. Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine are also being tried at different stages of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic for prophylaxis and treatment. While the use of these agents is being diversified, their adverse effects should be timely diagnosed and prevented. Hydroxychloroquine can cause retinopathy and rarely cardiac and auditory toxicity, retinopathy being dose and time dependent. Methotrexate can cause transaminitis, cytopenias and renal failure, particularly in acute overdoses. Colchicine can rarely cause myopathies, cardiomyopathy, cytopenias and transaminitis.

Methods Eleven pediatric patients (aged 11 to 13) who inhaled the smoke of smoke bombs underwent several low-dose chest CT scans. The image characteristics and their dynamic changes were observed and quantitative CT values were analyzed. The quantitative CT indicators included lung injury CT score (LICTS), lung fibrosis CT score (LFCTS), mean lung density (MLD), normally aerated volume ratio (NAVR) and reductively aerated volume ratio (RAVR). Box-plot was used to analyze the dynamic changes of each indicator and Spearman statistical method was used to analyze the correlation between any two indicators. Results (I) In most cases, there were multiple consolidation and massive ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the two lungs, which aggravated in the early stage and then gradually dissoluted in the later stage. LICTS was positively correlated with MLD (r=0.811, P=0.000), while it was negatively correlated with NAVR (r=-0.712, P=0.000). There existed interstitial fibrosis in the later stage, and LFCTS was positively correlated with RAVR (r=0.382, P=0.028). (II) In one case, the patterns were like layered cake, i.e., consolidation with air bronchus signs in the accumulation area, GGOs in the aforementioned area and normal lung in the top area. The patterns aggravated in the early stage and quickly dissolved in the later stage, and only a few residual fibrotic lesions existed on the final scan. (III) For severe cases, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema aggravated in the early stage and then gradually dissolved in the later stage. Conclusions The chest CT manifestations of inhalation lung injury induced by smoke bombs are predominantly GGOs and consolidation. They aggravate in the early stage and gradual dissolute in the later stage. CT quantitative values can contribute to evaluating the extent of this disease, and NAVR and RAVR can be used to assess pulmonary function.","output":"Inhalation lung injury induced by smoke bombs in children: CT manifestations, dynamic evolution features and quantitative analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to identify knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and develop an integrated educational program for healthcare workers.

The study focuses on the effects of containment and mitigation measures, on the behavior of children and youth (CaY) with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The study primary aim was to examine the impact of these urgent measures on the behaviors, communication, sleep, and nutritional status of the CaY. A secondary aim was to explore risk and protective factors on behavior change including sociodemographic variables, living conditions, ASD symptom severity and continuity of interventions. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 239 ASD subjects, 2C21 years of age, enrolled in the ELENA cohort in France at Stage 3 confinement and mitigation measures announced on March 16, 2020. A parent informant completed the COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the domains examined, challenging behaviors, communicative skills and sleep had the greatest impact; in terms of risk and protective factors, subject age, ASD severity, single parenthood, daily living skills, and intervention continuity were most likely to impact behaviors; living conditions were not linked to behavior change.

An empirical study is promptly needed to reliably assess the causal effects of the mobility restriction. The purpose of this study was to quantify the causal effects of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess the declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the logClog regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After 4 weeks, population mobility declined by ?54.81% (interquartile range, ?65.50% to ?43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with the significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout 6 weeks (ie, 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% [95% CI: 0.50%C0.93%] reduction of cumulative cases for 1 week, 1.42% 2 weeks, 1.69% 3 weeks, 1.72% 4 weeks, 1.64% 5 weeks, and 1.52% 6 weeks). The impact on the weekly new cases seemed greater in the first 4 weeks but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities.

The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the missing link in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician's consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases.

Thus, new ideas for an appropriated assessment of patients' condition and clinical treatment are of utmost importance. Therefore, in this study, the laboratory parameters of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were evaluated to identify the correlation between cytokine expression and other laboratory parameters. METHODS: A retrospective and single-center study was performed in Wuhan, involving 83 severe or critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory parameters in ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2 were collected. The association between parameters was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 66 years (IQR, 57-73), and 55 (66%) were men. Among the 83 patients, 61 (73%) had 1 or more coexisting medical condition. The median concentration of IL-2R, IL-6, IL8, IL10, and TNF&#945; were above the normal range, without IL-1?. A significant negative correlation between IL-6 and platelet count was discovered (r2 = -0.448, P < 0.001) as well as a significant correlation between IL-6 and other platelet parameters. Finally, a correlation between multiple cytokines and coagulation indicators was found, pro-inflammatory factors were found to be more associated to coagulation parameters, with the highest correlation between IL-6 and the International normalized ratio (INR) (r2 = 0.444, P < 0.001).

It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects a series of human tissues, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc. ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. The relatively low expression level of this known receptor in the lungs, which is the predominantly infected organ in COVID-19, indicates that there may be some other co-receptors or alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 to work in coordination with ACE2. Here, we identified twenty-one candidate receptors of SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2-interactor proteins and SARS-CoV receptors. Then we investigated the protein expression levels of these twenty-one candidate receptors in different human tissues and found that five of which CAT, MME, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and AGTR2 were specifically expressed in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues. Next, we performed molecular simulations of the above five candidate receptors with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and found that the binding affinities of CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to S protein were even higher than ACE2. Interestingly, we also observed that CAT and AGTR2 bound to S protein in different regions with ACE2 conformationally, suggesting that these two proteins are likely capable of the co-receptors of ACE2. Conclusively, we considered that CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, AGTR2 and DC-SIGN tend to be highly expressed in the lungs of smokers, which is consistent with clinical phenomena of COVID-19, and further confirmed our conclusion.

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patients progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible.

We aimed to investigate if frontline healthcare workers affected by infodemia show different psychological consequences than frontline clinicians who do not declare to be affected by false news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty-six frontline healthcare workers from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Emergency Departments in Romania completed a survey to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, between March and April 2020. We split the sample of frontline healthcare workers into two groups based on the self-evaluated criteria: if they were or were not affected by infodemia in their activity. Results: Considering limitations such as the cross-sectional design, the lack of causality relationship, and the sample size, the results show that, the frontline medical workers who declared to be affected by false news were significantly more stressed, felt more anxiety, and suffered more from insomnia than healthcare workers who are not affected by false information related to pandemic time. Conclusions: The infodemia has significant psychological consequences such as stress, anxiety, and insomnia on already overwhelmed doctors and nurses in the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis.

This includes Junn virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. The wild nature and mobility of the rodent reservoir host makes it difficult to control the disease, and currently passive immunization with high-titer neutralizing antibody-containing plasma from convalescent patients is the only specific therapy. However, dwindling supplies of naturally available convalescent plasma, and challenges in developing similar resources for other closely related viruses, have made the development of alternative antibody-based therapeutic approaches of critical importance. In this study, we sought to induce a neutralizing antibody response in rabbits against the receptor-binding subunit of the viral glycoprotein, GP1, and the specific peptide sequences in GP1 involved in cellular receptor contacts. While these specific receptor-interacting peptides did not efficiently induce the production of neutralizing antibodies when delivered as a particulate antigen (as part of hepatitis B virus core-like particles), we showed that recombinant JUNV GP1 purified from transfected mammalian cells induced virus-neutralizing antibodies at high titers in rabbits. Further, neutralization was observed across a range of unrelated JUNV strains, a feature that is critical for effectiveness in the field. These results underscore the potential of GP1 alone to induce a potent neutralizing antibody response and highlight the importance of epitope presentation. In addition, effective virus neutralization by rabbit antibodies supports the potential applicability of this species for the future development of immunotherapeutics (e.g., based on humanized monoclonal antibodies). Such information can be applied in the design of vaccines and immunogens for both prevention and specific therapies against this and likely also other closely related pathogenic New World arenaviruses.","output":"Immunization with GP1 but Not Core-like Particles Displaying Isolated Receptor-Binding Epitopes Elicits Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies against Junn Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper draws from the recent literature on psychological richness of life (PRL), conceptualized as a third dimension of a good life which would be particularly desirable when happiness or meaning in life cannot be satisfactory attained, to investigate whether recovering from a COVID infection could be associated with PRL.

This study aimed to explore the links between contextual variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disease and psychological outcomes. METHODS: The sample included 124 Portuguese patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (85.48% women) who completed self-reported measures in an online survey during April 2020. RESULTS: Fear of contracting COVID-19 and medication adherence were both high and unrelated. About half of the sample presented moderate (37.10%) to severe (14.50%) anxiety. Normal and mild anxiety levels were at 29.80% and 18.50%, respectively. Regarding depressive symptoms, 51.60% of the sample presented normal levels, 27.40% mild severity, 16.10% moderate, and 4.8% severe. No differences were found between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Regression analyses showed that anxiety explained IBD symptom perception (? = 0.29; P = 0.022); fear of contracting COVID-19 (? = 0.35; P < 0.001) and IBD symptom perception (? = -0.22; P = 0.009) explained depressive symptoms; and fear of contracting COVID-19 (? = 0.41; P < 0.001), IBD symptom perception (? = 0.26, P < 0.001), and being in isolation (? = -0.16, P = 0.041) explained anxiety.

We then analyzed the outcomes associations with the main explanatory variable chemsexer, after adjusting for all relevant variables. Among 7,195 MSM who had sexual intercourse with a man during the previous 6 months, 359 participants (5%) were identified as chemsexers. Multivariable analyses showed that during the first lockdown period, chemsexers were significantly more likely than non-chemsexers to have increased their use of tobacco, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances. Chemsexers were also more likely to have used psychotropic medication and to have experienced psychological distress during the previous month.

However, little is known on the corresponding adults' representation, adults who in case of disasters are frequently key informants on children's reactions. Examining the influence of earthquake experience, we explored adults' expectations on children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies. The participants were 572 Italian university students. Referring to what happens during and after earthquakes, they were asked to list children's (a) expected emotions, and (b) coping strategies for diminishing fear and sadness. We coded (a) number of fear, sadness, and anger terms; (b) presence of 13 coping strategies. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Fear was more frequent than sadness, and more frequent during vs. after earthquakes (and vice versa for sadness). Some coping strategies were reported rarely, while others were more salient (i.e. problem-solving, information-seeking, self-reliance, support-seeking, and accommodation). Earthquake experience had a marginal impact. Our findings enable us to deepen knowledge on the emotional representation of earthquakes.

Recent advances in distributed word representations address the word mismatch problem by enabling semantic matching. However, most existing models rank documents based on semantic matching between query and document terms without an explicit understanding of the relationship of the match to relevance. To consider semantic matching between query and document, we propose an unsupervised semantic matching model by simulating a user who makes relevance decisions. The primary goal of the proposed model is to combine the exact and semantic matching between query and document terms, which has been shown to produce effective performance in information retrieval. As semantic matching between queries and entire documents is computationally expensive, we propose to use local contexts of query terms in documents for semantic matching. Matching with smaller query-related contexts of documents stems from the relevance judgment process recorded by human observers. The most relevant part of a document is then recognized and used to rank documents with respect to the query. Experimental results on several representative retrieval models and standard datasets show that our proposed semantic matching model significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all measures.","output":"Relevance Ranking Based on Query-Aware Context Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ABO blood group system has been associated with multiple infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, dengue haemorrhagic fever and so on.

Prophylactic use of antibiotics however is an ongoing challenge in this situation due to bacterial multi-drug resistance. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the incidence of infectious complications in patients with AML undergoing induction therapy using the \\"7+3\\" protocol without routine antibiotic prophylaxis at one clinical site providing specialised haematological care in the Czech Republic, over a period of 15 years. The study also evaluates the aetiological spectrum of causative agents and the development of antibiotic resistance in the context of the use of the various classes of antibiotics. The analysis includes evaluation of the importance of risk factors for infectious complications and their impact on treatment of the underlying disease. The data are compared with published figures for similar cohorts of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study presents a retrospective analysis of infectious complications in 242 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing the first cycle of induction therapy without routine antibiotic prophylaxis in one clinical site in Czech Republic during years 2006-2020. RESULTS A total of 363 febrile episodes (FE) were recorded. At least 1 FE during the induction was detected in 229 (94.6%) patients. Clinically defined infection was the cause in 96 (26.4%) FEs and blood stream infection in 69 (19.0%) FEs. Both complications occurred simultaneously in 29 (8.0%) FEs. 169 (46.6%) FEs were evaluated as fever of unknown origin (FUO). The achievement of complete remission had a significant effect on the duration of the FE (6 vs. 9 days, P=0.0005) and on the overall survival duration (79.3 vs. 6.5 months, P<0.0001). Patients diagnosed with infection or FUO at diagnosis were significantly more likely to suffer from colonisation by multi-drug resistant bacterial strains at discharge (29.2% vs. 16.3%, P=0.022). This group of patients used antibiotic therapy for a significantly longer time (35 vs. 23 days, P<0.0001). Infection was a contributing cause of death in 18 (7.4%) patients. Mortality was significantly related to the failure to achieve complete remission (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION Infectious mortality during induction treatment without routine antibiotic prophylaxis was comparable to the published cohorts with prophylaxis. Regular microbiology surveillance with adequate initial antibiotic treatment can compensate routine antibiotic prophylaxis with slower development of antibiotic resistance.","output":"Infectious complications of induction treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia using the \\"7 + 3\\" protocol without antibiotic prophylaxis - 15 years of experience of one clinical site."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on the vulnerability of tourist cities economic systems during COVID-19 can offer insightful implications for tourism recovery and resilience. We built a vulnerability index of tourist cities economic systems based on sensitivity and responsiveness amid COVID-19. Taking 46 major tourist cities in China as a case, the vulnerability indices and main vulnerability-induced factors were analyzed using a comprehensive assessment model and a factor identification model. The results revealed several trends. First, after the pandemic emerged, the vulnerability of the economic systems of major tourist cities remained mostly moderate. Vulnerability could be further divided into four types across four city characteristics and four system characteristics. Second, sensitivity had a more pronounced effect on system vulnerability;crisis pressure and inbound tourism reliance exerted key influences on the vulnerability of tourist cities economic systems. Cities with high and relatively high vulnerability were subject to tourism reliance sensitivity factors and urban guarantee responsiveness factors. Third, the pandemics influence on tourist cities economic system vulnerability was mainly reflected in exogenous environmental stress vulnerability (i.e., due to external environmental stress), but was essentially endogenous structural imbalance vulnerability (i.e., due to imbalanced internal structures). Fourth, system vulnerability can be alleviated by reducing system sensitivity, improving system responsiveness, and enhancing the systems engineering resilience and ecological resilience. This study not only offers an overview of the vulnerability characteristics of tourist cities economic systems amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but also highlights the formation mechanisms of vulnerability.","output":"Vulnerability of Tourist Cities Economic Systems Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: System Characteristics and Formation MechanismsA Case Study of 46 Major Tourist Cities in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny.

DESIGN: Web-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: New York City-based academic reproductive medicine practice. PATIENT(S): A total of 305 infertile patients with a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy in their first trimester between December 1, 2019, and April 1, 2020, were matched by age and treatment type to pregnant patients from the year prior. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): First trimester clinical pregnancy loss rate. RESULT(S): In total, the first trimester pregnancy loss rate was lower in the COVID-19 era cohort compared with that in the pre-COVID-19 era cohort (11.9% vs. 20.1%). There was no difference between cohorts in the pregnancy loss rate of women conceiving via fresh embryo transfer (19.6% vs. 24.4%) or via frozen embryo transfer with preimplantation genetic testing (5.4% vs. 9.5%,). In women conceiving via frozen embryo transfer without preimplantation genetic testing, the pregnancy loss rate was statistically lower in the COVID-19 group (12.5% vs. 24.5%). There was no difference in the pregnancy loss rate by treatment type when stratifying by COVID-19 testing or symptom status. Of the 40 (13.1%) patients with a pregnancy loss, there was no difference in self-reported COVID-19 symptoms or symptom type compared with results in those who did not experience a pregnancy loss. CONCLUSION: Despite patients expressing significant worry about COVID-19 and pregnancy, our data provides reassuring information that the first trimester pregnancy loss rate is not elevated for women conceiving via assisted reproductive technology during the global COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss in the infertile population during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We test the safe-haven property of Gold and Bitcoin against equity markets (NSE50, DJIA, SSE, and CAC40) in the backdrop of Covid-19 We employ two multivariate volatility models, namely DCC and cDCC GARCH for analytical purposes We find both Gold and Bitcoin to be negligibly correlated with equity returns most of the time However, we observe a positive correlation during the initial phase of Covid-19 The results suggest that both Gold and Bitcoin exhibit the safe-haven property overall However, during Covid-19, the safe-haven property of both Bitcoin and Gold is found to be partially compromised We find Gold to exhibit relatively better safe-haven properties","output":"Testing Safe Haven Property of Bitcoin and Gold during Covid-19 : Evidence from Multivariate GARCH analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A human arm makes many functions that a robotic arm always programmed to make same functions The human limbs motion can be captured using sensors that they will always copy hand movement The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) virus and contacting the infections make the number of patients doubled in short time The system proposed in this research can protect clinicians against infection with virus by reducing the contact with the infected and treat them remotely This system type can be useful in different other fields of industrial works and defense where dangerous and delicate task can be done remotely without actual touch Xbee shield is used to allow a hand glove flex sensor to communicate with the robotic arm using Zigbee wirelessly Zigbee here is based on Xbee module from Max stream that can be communicate outdoor for 300 feet with the line of sight and indoor for 100 feet Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller used in the proposed system to achieve smooth movement of limbs The desired signal comes from flex sensor that connected to each limb Kalman estimator proposed to find current state of each limb In order to get better performance, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Telkomnika is the property of Department of Electrical Engineering, Ahmad Dahlan University and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Medical remotely caring with COVID-19 virus infected people using optimized wireless arm tracing system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the knowledge of dental professionals in Saudi Arabia regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to assess various dental professionals from both governmental and private sectors through online and social media outlets. RESULTS: A total of 1,033 questionnaires were collected (273 dental students, 193 dental auxiliary personnel, 544 dentists). In all, 63.4% of the respondents worked in hospitals. Of all the respondents, 44.9%, 33.4%, and 21.7% worked in governmental clinics, academia, and the private sector, respectively. Overall knowledge of the incubation period and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was consistent across all dental professions. Knowledge of hand-soap cleaning time was significantly different among dental professionals (p < 0.001). Dental professionals displayed significant disagreement on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the host (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 75.1% of the respondents were reluctant to treat a suspected COVID-19 patient, and 92% of the participants believed that the mode of transmission was droplet inhalation. Fever, coughing, and shortness of breath were identified as the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Most standard methods of prevention in the dental office were selected by at least 50% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dental professionals seem to be consistent regarding their knowledge of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. However, knowledge of viral survivability and recommended hand-soap washing time was significantly variable among the professionals.

To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large-scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones.

COVID-19 vaccination has been recommended by national and international organizations in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a population of Italian patients with IBD. Materials and methods: In February 2021 an online questionnaire focused on COVID-19 vaccine was proposed to a representative sample of Italian IBD patients. Socio-demographic characteristics, IBD features, lifestyle, perception of COVID-19, general attitude towards vaccinations and to COVID-19 vaccines were investigated. Patients were divided into willing, hesitant and refusive towards COVID-19 vaccine. The hesitation reasons were investigated. The associations between baseline characteristics and willingness (determinants) were evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted Odds Ratio (AdjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 1252 surveys were collected. 1005 (80.3%), 222 (18.1%) and 33 (2.63%) patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusive, respectively. The baseline characteristics are shown below. Concerns for vaccine adverse effects constituted the main reason for refusal (73.4%) (Figure). 49.1% of hesitant patients reported that presence of IBD exerted an influence on their answer. Among the patients willing to be vaccinated whenever possible, 78.2% (786) thought that their IBD represented a valid motivation to access vaccination with priority. Willingness to COVID-19 vaccine was significantly associated with adherence to previous vaccinations (AdjOR 17.6;95% CI: 11.4-27.2), male gender (1.68 95%;CI: 1.16-2.43), graduation degree (1.48;95%;CI: 1.03-2.13), perceived higher risk of COVID-19 becaues of IBD (1.47;95% CI: 1.05-2.08), alcohol intake (1.69;95% CI: 1.16-2.45). Conversely, the hesitancy was significantly associated with complementary and alternative medicine use (0.58;95% CI: 0.36-0.92). 54.5% of patients were under the impression to have a higher risk of COVID-19 and 31.8% to have a more severe course due to their IBD. (figure presented) Conclusions: Most IBD patients would accept COVID-19 vaccines, although one in five was hesitant, primarily due to fear of adverse events. Knowledge of determinants and reasons for COVID-19 vaccination acceptance or refusal could be key in developing targeted communication strategies to fight vaccine hesitancy, also in the future for general vaccinations.","output":"AF.49 DETERMINANTS OF COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD): RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY OF THE ITALIAN IBD PATIENTS ASSOCIATION (AMICI ONLUS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current times, the fear and danger of COVID-19 virus still stands large. Manual monitoring of social distancing norms is impractical with a large population moving about and with insufficient task force and resources to administer them.

This paper also provides a comparative study of different face detection and face mask classification models. Finally, a video dataset labelling method is proposed along with the labelled video dataset to compensate for the lack of dataset in the community and is used for evaluation of the system. The system performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, F1 score as well as the prediction time, which has to be low for practical applicability.

This paper extends our previous work by examining the predictive utility of the SSBA to identify self-attributed addiction problems. Method: Participants (N = 6,000) were recruited in Canada using quota sampling methods. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs) analyses were conducted, and thresholds established for each target behavior's subscale to predict self-attributed problems with these substances and behaviors. For each substance and behavior, regression models compared overall classification accuracy and model fit when lay epidemiologic indicators assessed using the SSBA were compared with validated screening measures to predict selfattributed problems. Results: ROC analyses indicted moderate to high diagnostic accuracy (Area under the curves (AUCs) 0.73-0.94) across SSBA subscales. Thresholds for identifying self-attributed problems were 3 for six of the subscales (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, shopping, and gaming), and 2 for the remaining four behaviors (gambling, eating, sexual activity, and working). Compared to other instruments assessing addiction problems, models using the SSBA provided equivalent or better model fit, and overall had higher classification accuracy in the prediction of self-attributed problems. Discussion and conclusions: The SSBA is a viable screening tool for problematic engagement across ten potentially addictive behaviors. Where longer screening tools are not appropriate, the SSBA may be used to identify individuals who would benefit from further assessment.","output":"Predictive utility of the brief Screener for Substance and Behavioral Addictions for identifying self-attributed problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and adapted to infect humans. Several SARS-CoV-2 strains have been identified. Genetic variation is fundamental to virus evolution and, in response to selection pressure, is manifested as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to different hosts or with novel pathogenicity. The combination of variation and selection forms a genetic footprint on the genome, consisting of the preferential accumulation of mutations in particular areas. Properties of betacoronaviruses contributing to variation and the emergence of new strains and species are beginning to be elucidated. To better understand their variation, we profiled the accumulation of mutations in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 and two other species that infect humans: SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Variation profiles identified both genetically stable and variable areas at homologous locations across species within the genus Betacoronavirus. The S glycoprotein is the most variable part of the genome and is structurally disordered. Other variable parts include proteins 3 and 7 and ORF8, which participate in replication and suppression of antiviral defense. In contrast, replication proteins in ORF1b are the least variable. Collectively, our results show that variation and structural disorder in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all members of the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the potential for the continual emergence of new species and strains with novel biological properties and indicate that the S glycoprotein has a critical role in host adaptation. IMPORTANCE Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines triggers the formation of antibodies against the S glycoprotein, which are detected by antibody-based diagnostic tests. Our analysis showed that variation in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including three species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The variable nature of the S glycoprotein provides an explanation for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 into strains, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 repeated infections in people. Variation of the S glycoprotein also has important implications for the reliability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based diagnostic tests and the design and deployment of vaccines and antiviral drugs. These findings indicate that adjustments to vaccine design and deployment and to antibody-based diagnostic tests are necessary to account for S glycoprotein variation.","output":"Genome-Wide Variation in Betacoronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (named a?COVID-2019a?) has gained attention globally and has been recognized as a serious","output":"Awareness and Preparedness of Hospital Staff against Novel Coronavirus (COVID-2019): A Global Survey - Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Background: Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome of Children (MIS-C) has recently emerged internationally as a serious inflammatory complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with significant morbidity for the pediatric population. METHODS: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 33 children meeting CDC criteria for MIS-C treated between March 15 and June 17, 2020 at Childrens National Hospital in Washington DC. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records and are summarized. RESULTS: Of 33 hospitalized MIS-C patients, 42% were critically ill, and 58% were non-critically ill. The median age was 8.9 years (0.7C18.7 years). More males (58 %) than females (43 %) were represented in the MIS-C cohort. The majority (75%) of children had no underlying medical condition. Criteria for incomplete or complete Kawasaki Disease (KD) were present in 39% of patients, while an additional 9% had some features of KD. However the remaining 52% of MIS-C patients presented with other sub-phenotypes including prominent severe abdominal pain and/or nonspecific multiorgan dysfunction. 30% presented with shock requiring volume and/or inotropic support. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 61% of patients. Virus was detectable by PCR in 36% of patients. At the time of initial evaluation, 39% (13/33) of children had identified cardiac abnormalities including myocardial dysfunction (5/33; 15%), coronary ectasia (4/33; 12%), coronary aneurysm (3/33; 9%), or pericardial effusion 5/33; 15%) either alone or in combination. Cytokine profiling identified elevation of several cytokines in this cohort, including IL-6. Treatment has included intravenous immunoglobulin, aspirin, anakinra and other immunomodulatory therapies, with overall rapid response to therapy. No deaths have occurred. CONCLUSION: The emergence of MIS-C late in the surge of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the Washington DC metropolitan region has added to the already significant burden of hospitalized and critically ill children in our region.

After effective autoclaving, SARS-CoV-2 contaminated on the surface of medical waste bags was killed, but the average concentration of viral RNA residues was still 0.85 copies/cm2. It would not pose a health risk, but might contaminate the laboratory and affect the test results. When the sterilized medical waste bags were transferred directly by the operators without hand disinfection, re-contamination would happen, which might cause the virus to leak out of the laboratory. Furthermore, we found that sterilization effect monitoring and cooperation among operators were also very important.

To be able to support the community during this time of crisis, especially when no in-person crisis services could be provided, an online mental health support and parenting group was offered to the community. While the primary goal of this group was to provide communitywide mental health support to as many parents as possible, the group was quickly compromised by people using the technology to disrupt the support program. The interference from disruptors to the security of the online program through so-called Zoombombing quickly created a dilemma as to how to safely provide quality care. This article provides a case report of a community-based parenting support program and explores the challenge of providing wide-scale online mental health care while also protecting the privacy and security of community members and the integrity of the program. In developing this project to support the community during the pandemic, several lessons were learned about use of virtual platforms, online security, and finding ways to care for the community through crisis.

Given that some of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are asymptomatic, antibody tests are useful to determine whether there is a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we measured IgM and IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of asymptomatic healthy subjects in The University of Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: From June 2020, we recruited participants, who were students, staff, and faculty members of The University of Tokyo in the project named The University of Tokyo COVID-19 Antibody Titer Survey (UT-CATS). Following blood sample collection, participants were required to answer an online questionnaire about their social and health information. We measured IgG and IgM titers against SARS-CoV-2 using iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection kit which applies a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection. RESULTS: There were 6609 volunteers in this study. After setting the cutoff value at 10 AU/mL, 32 (0.48%) were positive for IgG and 16 (0.24%) for IgM. Of six participants with a history of COVID-19, five were positive for IgG, whereas all were negative for IgM. The median titer of IgG was 0.40 AU/mL and 0.39 AU/mL for IgM.

An important component of the programme was the development of a health system performance assessment (HSPA) framework. In 2019, the Department of Health of Ireland (DoH) and Health Service Executive (HSE) commissioned the technical support of researchers to develop an outcome-oriented HSPA framework which should reflect the shared priorities of multiple stakeholders, including citizens. This study describes the method applied in the Irish context and reflects on the added value of using a citizen panel in the development of an HSPA framework. METHODS: A panel of 15 citizens was convened, recruited by a third-party company using a sampling strategy to achieve a balanced mix representing the Irish society. Panellists received lay-language preparatory materials before the meeting. Panellists used a three-colour scheme to signal the importance of performance measures. An exit questionnaire was administered to understand how participants experienced being part of the panel. The citizen panel was the first in a series of three panels towards the development of the HSPA framework, followed by panels including representatives of the DoH and HSE, and representatives from professional associations and special interest groups. RESULTS: The citizen panel generated 249 health performance measures ranging across 13 domains. Top-ranking domains to the citizen panel (people-centredness, coordination of care, and coverage) were less prioritized by the other panels; domains less prioritized by the citizen panel, such as accessibility, responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness, were of higher priority in the other panels. Citizen panellists shared a similar understanding of what a citizen panel involves and described their experience at the panel as enjoyable, interesting, and informative. CONCLUSIONS: The priorities of the citizen panel were accounted for during all phases of developing the HSPA framework. This was possible by adopting an inclusive development process and by engaging citizens early on. Citizen engagement in HSPA development is essential for realizing citizen-driven healthcare system performance and generating trust and ownership in performance intelligence. Future research could expand the use of citizen panels to assess, monitor, and report on the performance of healthcare systems.

A growing body of data shows that infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very complex and multifaceted disease requiring its detailed study to fight with. Nevertheless, there is a row of stumbling blocks in the way of experimental research of COVID-19 determined by the deficiency of appropriate animal models. Herein, we report novel humanized mice with Cre-dependent expression of hACE2, the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2. These mice carry hACE2 and GFP transgenes floxed by the STOP-cassette, allowing them to be used as breeders for the creation of animals with the tissue-specific co-expression of hACE2 and GFP. Moreover, inducible expression of hACE2 makes this line biosafe, whereas co-expression with GFP simplifies the detection of transgene-expressing cells. In our study, we tested our line by crossing with Ubi-Cre mice, characterized by tamoxifen-dependent ubiquitous activation of Cre-recombinase. After tamoxifen administration, copy number of the STOP-cassette was decreased and the offspring expressed hACE2 and GFP, confirming the efficiency of our system. We believe that our model can be a useful tool for studying COVID-19 pathogenesis because the selective expression of hACE2 can shed light on the role of different tissues in SARS-CoV-2 associated complications.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old girl sustained a burst fracture of L1 in conjunction with bilateral ankle fractures. During rehabilitation, the calcaneal fracture on the left and tibial plafond fracture on the right prevented her progression in conventional rehabilitation. An alternative strategy K-ing (Kneel Standing/Kneel Walking) was adopted to facilitate truncal activation without loading the ankle joints. This was found to be helpful in obtaining upright posture stability without hampering her recovery of associated ankle injuries. DISCUSSION: K-ing strategy can be useful and presents a simple alternative in the presence of associated ankle injuries. It also avoids complications associated with bedrest when there is delay in initiation of ambulation.","output":"Progression to ambulation following lower limb fractures in an individual with a spinal cord injury: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Herein, the heterogeneous tumor stroma decisively impacts on tumor progression, therapy resistance, and, thus, poor clinical outcome. Among the numerous non-epithelial cells constructing the complex environment of lung carcinomas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) gained attraction being stromal precursor cells that could be recruited and educated by lung cancer cells to adopt a tumor-associated MSC phenotype, serve as source for activated fibroblasts and presumably for vascular mural cells finally reinforcing tumor progression. Lung-resident MSCs should be considered as local MSCs in stand by ready to be arranged within the cancer stroma. ABSTRACT: Lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) are non-hematopoietic multipotent stromal cells that predominately reside adventitial within lung blood vessels. Based on their self-renewal and differentiation properties, LR-MSCs turned out to be important regulators of normal lung homeostasis. LR-MSCs exert beneficial effects mainly by local secretion of various growth factors and cytokines that in turn foster pulmonary regeneration including suppression of inflammation. At the same time, MSCs derived from various tissues of origins represent the first choice of cells for cell-based therapeutic applications in clinical medicine. Particularly for various acute as well as chronic lung diseases, the therapeutic applications of exogenous MSCs were shown to mediate beneficial effects, hereby improving lung function and survival. In contrast, endogenous MSCs of normal lungs seem not to be sufficient for lung tissue protection or repair following a pathological trigger; LR-MSCs could even contribute to initiation and/or progression of lung diseases, particularly lung cancer because of their inherent tropism to migrate towards primary tumors and metastatic sites. However, the role of endogenous LR-MSCs to be multipotent tumor-associated (stromal) precursors remains to be unraveled. Here, we summarize the recent knowledge how cancer-educated LR-MSCs impact on lung cancer with a focus on mesenchymal stem cell fates.","output":"Lung-Resident Mesenchymal Stem Cell Fates within Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CO2 emissions are one of the major contributors to global warming The variety of emission sources and the nature of CO2 hinders estimating its concentration in real time and therefore to adopt flexible policies that contribute to its control and, ultimately, to reduce its effects Spain is not exempted from this challenge and CO2 emissions are published only at the end of the year and as an aggregated value for the whole country, without recognising the existing differences between the regions (the so-called, Autonomous Communities) The recent COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of the need of accurate and fast estimation methods so that policies can be tailored to the current status and not to a past one This paper provides a method to estimate monthly emissions of CO2 for each AACC in Spain based on data that are published monthly by the relevant administrations The paper discusses the approximations needed in the development of the method, predicts the drop in emissions due to the reduced industrial activity during the pandemic in Spain and provides the estimation of future emissions under three recovery scenarios after the pandemic","output":"Real-time CO2 emissions estimation in Spain and application to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transdermal drug delivery uses chemical, physical, or biochemical enhancers to cross the skin barrier.

METHODS: Weekly long episode counts (LEC) were used as a proxy for seizures for six months pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period. Telephone surveys and chart reviews were conducted to assess patient mental health during the pandemic. The change in LEC between the two time periods was correlated to reported stressors. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. Comparing the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, we found that only 5 (25%) patients had increased seizures, which was positively correlated with change in anti-seizure medications (ASM, p=0.03) and bitemporal seizures (p=0.03). Increased seizures were not correlated to anxiety (p=1.00), depression (p=0.58), and sleep disturbances (p=1.00). The correlation between RNS-detected and patient-reported seizures was poor (p=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Most of our patients did not have an increase in seizures following the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in ASM and bitemporal seizures were positively correlated to increased LEC. There was no correlation between pandemic-related stress and seizures in those found to have increased seizures.

Because childhood obesity is a sensitive topic, many healthcare professionals find it difficult to discuss children's excess weight with parents. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in childhood obesity-related communication, as perceived by healthcare professionals in Romania. As part of the STOP project, healthcare professionals (family physicians, pediatricians, and dieticians) who treat children with excess weight were invited to a telephone interview. The semi-structured questions were translated from a questionnaire previously used at the Swedish study site of the STOP project. Interviews were transcribed and then used for thematic analysis. Fifteen doctors and three dieticians (16 females and 2 males), with average 18.2  10.1 years of experience, were interviewed. Four main themes were identified. Professionals reported that when children began experiencing obesity-related stigma or comorbidities, this became the tipping point of weight excess, where parents felt motivated to begin treatment. Barriers in communication were part of several layers of distrust, recognized as tension between professionals and caregivers due to conflicting beliefs about excess weight, as well as lack of trust in medical studies. Most respondents felt confident using models of good practice, consisting of a gentle approach and patient-centered care. Nonetheless, professionals noted systemic barriers due to a referral system and allocation of clinical time that hinder obesity treatment. They suggested that lack of specialized centers and inadequate education of healthcare professional conveys the system does not prioritize obesity treatment and prevention. The interviewed Romanian doctors and dieticians identified patient-centered care as key to treating children with obesity and building trust with their caregivers. However their efforts are hindered by healthcare system barriers, including the lack of specialized centers, training, and a referral system. The findings therefore suggest that, to improve childhood obesity prevention and treatment, systemic barriers should be addressed.

By using this system, the duration of a primary transcription initiation activity which transcribes subgenomic-size RNAs from the genomic-size RNA template in MHV-infected cells was examined. Efficient DI genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis was observed when the DI RNA was transfected at 1, 3, 3.5, 5, and 6 h postinfection, indicating that all activities which are necessary for MHV RNA synthesis are present continuously during the first 6 h of infection. The effect of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis on DI genomic RNA replication was then examined. Replication efficiency of the DI genomic RNA which synthesized the subgenomic RNA was approximately 70% lower than that of DI genomic RNA which did not synthesize the subgenomic DI RNA in MHV-infected cells. Cotransfection of two different-size DI RNAs demonstrated that replication of the larger DI RNA was strongly inhibited by replication of the smaller genomic DI RNA. Cotransfection of two DI RNA species of the same length into MHV-infected cells demonstrated that reduced replication of the genomic DI RNA which synthesizes the subgenomic RNA did not affect the replication of cotransfected DI RNA, demonstrating that the reduction in DI genomic RNA replication works only in cis, not in trans. Therefore, the previously proposed hypothesis that coronavirus, subgenomic RNA synthesis may inhibit the replication of genomic RNA by competing for a limited amount of virus-derived factors seems unlikely.

RESULTS 4 studies were included and 7 themes identified relating to the benefits of, and barriers to, participation in PEoLC research. Both altruistic and personal benefits of participation were reported. Barriers (negative aspects) to participation included feeling overwhelmed, practical issues, reminders of being a patient, not seeing the research as relevant to them and unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS A number of benefits (positive aspects) surround participation in PEoLC research. However, several barriers (negative aspects) can prevent or discourage participation.

This paper quantifies how much system congestion may have increased mortality rates, using distance to the ICU as a proxy for access to emergency care. METHODS: We match daily death registry data for almost 1,500 municipalities in Lombardy, Italy, to data on geographical location of all ICU beds in the region. We then analyze how system congestion increases mortality in municipalities that are far from the ICU through a differences-in-differences regression model. FINDINGS: We find that Covid-19 mortality is up to 60% higher in the average municipality -- which is 15 minutes driving away from the closest ICU -- than in a municipality with an ICU in town. This difference is larger in areas and in days characterized by an abnormal number of calls to the emergency line. INTERPRETATION: We interpret these results as suggesting that a sudden surge of critical patients may have congested the healthcare system, forcing emergency medical services to prioritize patients in the most proximate communities in order to maximize the number of lives saved. Through some back-of-the-envelope calculations, we estimate that Lombardy's death toll from the first Covid-19 outbreak could have been 25% lower had all municipalities had ready access to the ICU. Drawing a lesson from Lombardy's tale, governments should strengthen the emergency care response and palliate geographical inequalities to ensure that everyone in need can receive critical care on time during new outbreaks.","output":"How Emergency Care Congestion Increases Covid-19 Mortality: Evidence from Lombardy, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since H7N9 influenza A virus (H7N9) was first reported in 2013, five waves of outbreaks have occurred, posing a huge threat to human health. In preparation for a potential H7N9 epidemic, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of anti-H7N9 drugs with an appropriate model. METHODS: Well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium (HAE) cells were grown at the airCliquid interface, and the H7N9 cell tropism and cytopathic effect were detected by immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The H7N9 replication kinetics and anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human 2b (rhIFN-2b) and rhIFN-1 were compared with different cell lines. The H7N9 viral load and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were quantified by real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: H7N9 could infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells within the three-dimensional (3D) HAE cell culture, which reduced the number of cilia and damaged the airways. The H7N9 replication kinetics differed between traditional cells and 3D HAE cells. Interferon had antiviral activity against H7N9 and alleviated epithelial cell lesions; the antiviral activity of rhIFN-2b was slightly better than that of rhIFN-1. In normal cells, rhIFN-2b induced a greater amount of ISG expression (MX1, OAS1, IFITM3, and ISG15) compared with rhIFN-1, but in 3D HAE cells, this trend was reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Both rhIFN-2b and rhIFN-1 had antiviral activity against H7N9, and this protection was related to the induction of ISGs. The 3D cell culture model is suitable for evaluating interferon antiviral activity because it can demonstrate realistic in vivo-like effects.","output":"Anti-H7N9 avian influenza A virus activity of interferon in pseudostratified human airway epithelium cell cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected human life especially in the Indonesian economy and the transportation sub-sector.

In total, 284 recovered participants with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Patients had a mean age of 46.72 years (standard deviation [SD], 17.09), and 138 (48.59%) were male. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 225.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 219 to 232) days. During the follow-up period (162 to 282 days after symptom onset), the seropositive rate of IgM fluctuated around 25.70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.72% to 31.20%) and that of IgG fluctuated around 79.93% (95% CI, 74.79% to 84.43%). Of the 284 patients, 64 participants were tested when discharged from hospital. Compared with that at the acute phase, the IgM/IgG antibody levels and IgM seropositivity have decreased; however, the seropositivity of IgG was not significantly lower at this follow-up (78.13% versus 82.81%). Fifty percent inhibitory dilution (ID(50)) titers of neutralizing antibody for samples when discharged from hospital (geometric mean titer [GMT], 82; 95% CI, 56 to 121) were significantly higher than those at 6 to 7 months after discharge (GMT, 47; 95% CI, 35 to 63) (P < 0.001). After 7 months from symptom onset, the convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have high IgG seropositive; however, many plasma samples decreased neutralizing activity. IMPORTANCE The long-term characteristics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Tracking the longevity of these antibodies can provide a forward-looking reference for monitoring COVID-19. We conducted a comprehensive assessment combining the kinetics of specific and neutralizing antibodies over 7 months with age and disease severity and revealed influencing factors of the protection period of convalescent patients. By observing the long-term antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and comparing antibody levels at two time points after symptom onset, we found that the convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have a high IgG seropositive rate; however, their plasma samples decreased neutralizing activity. These findings provide evidence supporting that the neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons should be monitored and the administration of vaccine may be needed.","output":"Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Specific and Neutralizing Antibodies over Seven Months after Symptom Onset in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is characterized by a severe pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in about 20% of infected patients.

Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires infected or unstable patient to be moved to the Radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, CT room needs proper sanification after use, and is underutilized in children and pregnant women for radioexposition concerns. The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a non-invasive, bedside and emerging technique for the diagnosis of interstitial lung syndrome by evaluating and quantifying the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations. In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS shows a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity, and peripheral consolidations. LUS showed to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings fairly correlate with chest CT scan. Compared to CT, LUS have several other advantages, such as preventing exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low-cost and easier application in low-resource settings. Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).

We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid\\\\19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial cytokine storm, as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl\\\\coenzyme A (acetyl\\\\CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian resetting of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl\\\\CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N\\\\acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus\\\\ and cytokine\\\\storm\\\\driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus\\\\and cytokine storm\\\\driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short\\\\chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Survival is highly dependent on surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is increasingly chosen over open thoracotomy (OT) because of the possible benefits of the minimally invasive approach. Consequently, our aim was to compare the 30-day morbidity and mortality for lung cancer patients operated by VATS lobectomy or lobectomy by OT. METHOD Data were obtained from prospective national and regional databases, including patients who underwent lobectomy for lung cancer in the eastern part of Denmark from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. All patients operated before 2009 were re-staged according to the latest International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer lung cancer classification. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, pathology and operative data were assessed using an independent samples t-test, Pearson's (2), Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test. Morbidity was assessed using multinomial logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, cancer stage, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), year of surgery and Charlson comorbidity score. RESULTS In total, 1379 patients underwent lobectomy, 785 patients via VATS and 594 patients via thoracotomy. The two groups were similar in gender and FEV1. The patients operated by VATS were older (P < 0.001), and had a lower Charlson comorbidity score (P = 0.034), higher frequency of adenocarcinomas (P < 0.001) and lower cancer stage (P < 0.001). Among the VATS patients, 285 (36.3%) and among the thoracotomy patients, 288 (48.5%) had minor complications (P < 0.001); and 157 (20.0%) VATS patients and 212 (35.7%) thoracotomy patients had major complications (P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate was 1% in the VATS group and 1.5% in the thoracotomy group (P = 0.47). Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that the prevalence of both minor [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.18-1.96] and major complications (OR = 1.91, 95% Cl = 1.44-2.53) was significantly higher for patients who underwent lobectomy via thoracotomy compared with VATS. CONCLUSION Patients undergoing lobectomy via VATS were less likely to have at least one minor complication within the first 30 postoperative days and less likely to have at least one major complication, compared with patients operated by thoracotomy. These findings remained after adjusting for gender, age, FEV1, cancer stage, year of surgery and Charlson comorbidity score.","output":"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy for lung cancer is associated with a lower 30-day morbidity compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increase of COVID-19 cases worldwide, an effective way is required to diagnose COVID-19 patients. The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19 patients is the shortage and reliability of testing kits, due to the quick spread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty in identifying the positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the organizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are the major concerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a framework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various hospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain-based federated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated learning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the organization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with the heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals having different kinds of Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based segmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design a method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain technology with federated learning while preserving privacy. Additionally, we collected real-life COVID-19 patients&#x2019;data open to the research community. The proposed framework can utilize up-to-date data which improves the recognition of CT images.

We review work that describes the prevalence of the virus on common objects, the longevity of the virus on solids, and surface coatings that are designed to inactivate the virus. Engineered coatings have already succeeded in producing a large reduction in viral infectivity from surfaces. We also review work describing inactivation on facemasks and clothing, and discuss probable mechanisms of inactivation of the virus at surfaces.","output":"The Viability of SARS-COV-2 on Solid Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory illness, myocardial injury is increasingly reported and associated with adverse outcomes. However, the pathophysiology, extent of myocardial injury and clinical significance remains unclear. METHODS: COVID-HEART is a UK, multicentre, prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and elevated troponin (sex-specific > 99th centile). Baseline assessment will be whilst recovering in-hospital or recently discharged, and include cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, quality of life (QoL) assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), serum biomarkers and genetics. Assessment at 6-months includes repeat CMR, QoL assessments and 6-min walk test (6MWT). The CMR protocol includes cine imaging, T1/T2 mapping, aortic distensibility, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in selected patients. The main objectives of the study are to: (1) characterise the extent and nature of myocardial involvement in COVID-19 patients with an elevated troponin, (2) assess how cardiac involvement and clinical outcome associate with recognised risk factors for mortality (age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities) and genetic factors, (3) evaluate if differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months are dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, (4) understand the impact of recovery status at 6 months on patient-reported QoL and functional capacity. DISCUSSION: COVID-HEART will provide detailed characterisation of cardiac involvement, and its repair and recovery in relation to comorbidity, genetics, patient-reported QoL measures and functional capacity.

Hence the awareness of healthcare workers in regards with biomedical waste (BMW) management is crucial in this pandemic. This study is therefore conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices in BMW management among health care workers in our institution. RESULTS: A total of 280 subjects consisting of doctors, nursing staff and group D workers were included in the study after obtaining informed consent. The knowledge among healthcare workers was satisfactory, but comparatively group D workers were lagging behind. Overall they all have a good attitude towards BMW management but practices on BMW management needs improvement mostly among group D workers. CONCLUSIONS: There have to be regular training programmes on biomedical waste management and its hazards for all the healthcare workers including group D workers.

Intramyocardial dissecting hematoma (IDH) is one such complication of myocardial infarction. Case A 51 year-old male patient with a background of hypertension presented with a 7 hour history of typical chest pain. His initial ECG showed anterolateral ST segment elevation with reciprocal ST depression in the inferior leads, consistent with STEMI. Urgent angiography revealed a 100% acute occlusion in the mid-LAD. TIMI 3 flow was restored using a Xience 3.00 x 18mm stent, with resolution of pain and interval ECG improvement. Laboratory investigations revealed new significant anaemia. Decision-making Post-procedural transthoracic echocardiography revealed severely impaired systolic function and moderate concentric biventricular hypertrophy, and raised the suspicion of a mechanical complication (see image). This was further supported by his delayed presentation and extensive infarct area. His anaemia was suggestive of active haemorrhage. Endoscopic investigation failed to show a gastrointestinal source. Cardiac MRI (CMR) confirmed the presence of IDH.

Generally, COVID-19 has three possible transmission routes, including pre-symptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, among which the last one has brought a severe challenge for the containment of the disease. One core scientific question is to understand the influence of asymptomatic individuals and of the strength of control measures on the evolution of the disease, particularly on a second outbreak of the disease. To explore these issues, we proposed a novel compartmental model that takes the infection of asymptomatic individuals into account. We get the relationship between asymptomatic individuals and critical strength of control measures theoretically. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of our model and the accuracy of the theoretical analysis by using the real confirmed cases of COVID-19 contamination.

Longitudinal Neuropsychiatric Inventory and psychotropic medication prescription data from neuropathologically diagnosed pure ADNC (n = 78), pure LATE-NC (n = 14) and mixed ADNC/LATE-NC (n = 39) brain bank donors were analysed using analysis of variance and linear mixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between diagnostic group and neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Nearly all donors had dementia; three (two pure LATE-NC and one pure ADNC) donors had mild cognitive impairment and another two donors with LATE-NC did not have dementia. The mixed ADNC/LATE-NC group was older than the pure ADNC group, had a higher proportion of females compared to the pure ADNC and LATE-NC groups, and had more severe dementia versus the pure LATE-NC group. After adjustment for length of follow-up, cognitive and demographic factors, mixed ADNC/LATE-NC was associated with lower total Neuropsychiatric Inventory and agitation factor scores than pure ADNC, and lower frontal factor scores than pure LATE-NC. Our findings indicate that concomitant LATE pathology in Alzheimers disease is not associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Future longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate whether mixed ADNC/LATE-NC may be protective against agitation and frontal symptoms in dementia caused by Alzheimers disease or LATE pathology.","output":"Neuropsychiatric symptoms in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and Alzheimers disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite considerable progress in tackling cardiovascular disease over the past 50 years, many gaps in the quality of care for cardiovascular disease remain.

The virus selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. Furthermore, it can be genetically engineered to increase tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, treatment with measles virus activates antitumor immune responses. A number of clinical trials using measles virus for cancer treatment have been completed or are ongoing. Future studies will further harness the possibilities of virus engineering and potential of combination immunotherapies to improve clinical outcome. ABSTRACT: Measles virus (MeV) preferentially replicates in malignant cells, leading to tumor lysis and priming of antitumor immunity. Live attenuated MeV vaccine strains are therefore under investigation as cancer therapeutics. The versatile MeV reverse genetics systems allows for engineering of advanced targeted, armed, and shielded oncolytic viral vectors. Therapeutic efficacy can further be enhanced by combination treatments. An emerging focus in this regard is combination immunotherapy, especially with immune checkpoint blockade. Despite challenges arising from antiviral immunity, availability of preclinical models, and GMP production, early clinical trials have demonstrated safety of oncolytic MeV and yielded promising efficacy data. Future clinical trials with engineered viruses, rational combination regimens, and comprehensive translational research programs will realize the potential of oncolytic immunotherapy.","output":"Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the possibility of a surge of COVID-19-infected patients requiring ventilatory support in Intensive Care Units (ICU), the Singapore Hospice Council and the Chapter of Palliative Medicine Physicians forward its position on the guiding principles that ought to drive the allocation of ICU beds and its role in care of these patients and their families.","output":"The role of palliative medicine in ICU bed allocation in COVID-19: a joint position statement of the Singapore Hospice Council and the Chapter of Palliative Medicine Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Este artigo analisa como o federalismo brasileiro tem afetado o combate  COVID-19.

Although early recognition and treatment can prevent the development of permanent damage, psoriatic disease remains underdiagnosed and undertreated due in part to the disparity between disease prevalence and relative lack of access to clinical specialists in dermatology and rheumatology. Remote patient self-assessment aided by smartphone sensor technology may be able to address these gaps in care, however, these innovative disease measurements require robust clinical validation. Methods We developed smartphone-based assessments, collectively named the Psorcast suite, that can be self-administered to measure cutaneous and musculoskeletal signs and symptoms of psoriatic disease. The image and motion sensor data collected by these assessments was processed to generate digital biomarkers or machine learning models to detect psoriatic disease phenotypes. To evaluate these digital endpoints, a cross-sectional, in-clinic validation study was performed with 92 participants across two specialized academic sites consisting of healthy controls and participants diagnosed with psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. Findings In the domain of skin disease, digital patient assessment of percent body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis demonstrated very strong concordance (CCC = 0.94, [95%CI = 0.91-0.96]) with physician-assessed BSA. Patient-captured psoriatic plaque photos were remotely assessed by physicians and compared to in-clinic Physician Global Assessment parameters for the same plaque with fair to moderate concordance (CCCerythema=0.72 [0.59-0.85]; CCCinduration=0.72 [0.62-0.82]; CCCscaling=0.60 [0.48-0.72]). Arm range of motion was measured by the Digital Jar Open assessment to classify physician-assessed upper extremity involvement with joint tenderness or enthesitis, demonstrating an AUROC = 0.68 (0.47-0.85). Patient-captured hand photos were processed with object detection and deep learning models to classify clinically-diagnosed nail psoriasis with an accuracy of 0.76, which is on par with remote physician rating of nail images (avg. accuracy = 0.63) with model performance maintaining accuracy when raters were too unsure or image quality was too poor for a remote assessment. Interpretation The Psorcast digital assessments, performed by patient self-measurement, achieve significant clinical validity when compared to in-person physical exams. These assessments should be considered appropriately validated for self-monitoring and exploratory research applications, particularly those that require frequent, remote disease measurements. However, further validation in larger cohorts will be necessary to demonstrate robustness and generalizability across populations for use in evidence-based medicine or clinical trial settings.

The aims of this study were to (1) describe the prepartum and calf-rearing systems, as well as the management practices that may influence calf welfare in pastured dairy herds in Uruguay, (2) estimate the annual calf mortality risk from birth to weaning, and (3) identify the primary clinical disease syndromes shown by the calves before death. A survey comprising a farm visit and a questionnaire was conducted on 225 randomly selected dairies with >30 milking cows, in 3 strata (31-99, 100-299, and 300 milking cows) of 6 Uruguayan departments where dairies are concentrated. Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive  100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively. There was no continuous veterinary advice in 61.3% of the farms, 20.0% lacked data records, 38.5% had poor drainage in the prepartum area with waterlogging after rainfall, 52.1% monitored the prepartum area 2 times per day during the calving season, 65.1% did not perform navel antisepsis on newborns, 62.3% separated the calves from their dams at >24 h postpartum, 95.2% did not have a colostrum management program, 72.4% did not rotate the calf-rearing areas, 59.0% did not disinfect the calf feeders, 85.7% did not have staff dedicated exclusively to calf rearing, and 39.8% did not separate sick from healthy calves.

Within several years after the accident, a high-concentration water plume of the FNPP1-derived radiocesium at the sea surface had been transported from Japan to the North American continent across the subarctic gyre of the North Pacific Ocean. We measured vertical profiles of dissolved radiocesium along the nominal 47N zonal line across the North Pacific subarctic gyre twice, in summer 2012 and summer 2014. Using these data and published data, we quantitatively discussed the zonal and vertical transports of the water plume until 2014.

Morbidity and mortality have been highest in adults, particularly in those with underlying conditions including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Children, thus far, have largely remained either asymptomatic or presented with mild symptoms. However, sickle cell disease (SCD) was classified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease in both adults and pediatric patients. Objective: To describe the one-year experience of the clinical course, management, and treatment of COVID-19 in children, and young adults with SCD at Children's National Hospital (CNH). Methods: This was a single-center, observational cohort study of 55 children (age <18 years) and young adult (age  18 years) patients with SCD and PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at CNH between March 31, 2020, and February 12, 2021 (Figure 1A). Results: Sixty-nine percent were children (N=38) and 31% were young adults (N=17). The mean age was 11.6 years with 51% females (N=28) and 49% males (N=27). Seventy-five percent of cases were Hgb SS, 15% Hgb SC, and 11% Hgb SBeta Thalassemia Zero (Table 1). Fever (45%) was the most common presenting symptom; only 9% had a loss of taste or smell (Figure 1B). Twenty-two percent were asymptomatic at presentation. Among the 40 patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized, 50% (N=20) presented with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC), 42% with Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS), 2% with splenic sequestration, and 2% with Venous Thromboembolism. Only 3% were admitted to the ICU (N=2 young adults, N=1 children); none of whom were on hydroxyurea. There were no differences in hospitalization rates between Hgb SS and Hgb SC patients (Table 1). Lower oxygen saturation (02 Sat)(02 Sat <95%: 62% vs 16% p=0.004), fevers (69% vs 16%, p=0.001), VOC pain crisis (50% vs 24%, p=0.047), and ACS (65% vs 3%, p<0.001) were more common in hospitalized patients vs. non-hospitalized patients. Patients with ACS experienced a longer length of stay (6 days vs. 3 days p=0.008), lower oxygen saturation (02Sat<95%: 81% vs 13% p<0.001), higher white blood cell count (13.3 vs 9.0 K/mcL, p=0.009), lower hemoglobin nadir (6.8 vs. 9.6 gm/dL, p= 0.049), and elevated D-dimers (4.1 vs. 0.8 ug/mL, p=0.002) compared to those without ACS. The types of treatment received by patients requiring hospitalization or ED visits included ceftriaxone (N=28, 70%), azithromycin (N=15, 37.5%), remdesivir (N=6,15%) convalescent plasma(N=1,2.5%). Blood transfusion was required in 29% of the 55 SCD COVID-19 cases (N=16) and 76% (N=13) of the ACS patients. Twenty-six percent (N=17) of hospitalized patients were anticoagulated with either enoxaparin or rivaroxaban according to CNH's COVID-19 anticoagulation treatment protocol. There were similar rates of healthcare utilization, SCD modifying therapies, acute COVID-19 clinical presentation, respiratory support, and laboratory findings (hematologic, inflammatory) between the children and young adults. However, young adults were more likely to be on crizanlizumab treatment (18% vs 0%, p=0.026) and have an elevated D-Dimer (4.0 vs 1.0, p=0.012) on laboratory evaluation. Conclusion: Our case series reveals that the demographics and clinical presentation between our SCD children and young adult patients with COVID-19 were similar overall. While the morbidity was high, there was no mortality. Those that were hospitalized had lower oxygen saturation levels, higher incidences of fever, and higher morbidity presenting with VOC and ACS. Patients with ACS and/or an oxygen requirement had significantly higher WBC count, lower nadir hemoglobin, and higher D-dimers in a small subset of patients supporting a pro-inflammatory and coagulopathic picture.

METHODS: Acute cardiovascular hospitalizations were tracked between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Daily hospitalization rates were estimated using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There were 43.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 compared with March 2019 (p < 0.001). The daily rate of hospitalizations did not change throughout 2019 (-0.01% per day [95% CI: -0.04% to +0.02%]; p = 0.50), January 2020 (-0.5% per day [95% CI: -1.6% to +0.5%]; p = 0.31), or February 2020 (+0.7% per day [95% CI: -0.6% to +2.0%]; p = 0.27). There was significant daily decline in hospitalizations in March 2020 (-5.9% per day [95% CI: -7.6% to -4.3%]; p < 0.001).

We aimed to describe the health-related quality of life, and burnout in frontline physicians diagnosed with anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the first-wave phase of COVID-19, from September to October 2020. Questionnaires were sent electronically to 450 physicians from State of Bahia, assessing symptoms of anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and burnout syndrome. For the categorical variables, the Pearson's chi-square test was used and difference between means was compare using the Mann-Whitney test. was Groups with and without anxiety symptoms were compared using prevalence ratios (PR). Pearson's correlation measured the correlation between WHOQOL-BREF and MBI (Maslach Burnout Inventory) domains. The Fisher r-to-z transformation was used to assess the significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients. The significance level was <0.05. RESULTS: Out of the 450 physicians, 223 (49,6%) completely answered the questionnaire and 38 (17%) showed symptoms of anxiety. Physicians with anxiety had higher scores in emotional exhaustion (EE) (38.31  8.59 vs 25.310.87; p = 0.0001) and depersonalization (DP) (9.0  5.6 vs 5.9  5.3; p = 0.001) domains, and lower scores in personal accomplishment (PA) (32.1  8.2 vs 36.3  7.6; p = 0.004), than those without anxiety. All correlations between WHOQOL-BREF domains and MBI in physicians without anxiety were significant (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Physicians with anxiety showed more emotional exhaustion, less personal accomplishment, and lower quality of life. All domains of WHOQOL BREF were correlated with all MBI domains among physicians without anxiety. Differences in correlation according to anxiety were remarkable in psychological HOQOL BREF domain and emotional exhaustion and depersonalization MBI domains. The effect of anxiety leading to poorer levels of perceived health needs to be further investigated.","output":"Anxiety, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of burnout in frontline physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate clinical features and outcomes of children in Taiwan with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vs those of children with influenza to differentiate the 2 diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients 20 years or younger with clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory evidence of SARS from March to July 2003 vs children with virus culture-confirmed influenza in a 1:1 age- and sex-matched control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of symptoms, abnormal laboratory data, and outcomes of recovery, sequelae, or death. RESULTS The 15 SARS patients (9 girls and 6 boys) had a median age of 17 years (age range, 4-20 years). Nine patients (60%) were infected through household contact, 4 (27%) nosocomially, 1 (7%) through contact with a neighbor, and 1 (7%) after returning from Hong Kong. All 15 patients had fever, 3 (20%) had chills, and 11 (73%) had cough. Only 1 patient (7%) had sputum production; 1 (7%) had rhinorrhea. At presentation, 5 patients (33%) had leukopenia, 6 (40%) had lymphopenia, and 5 (33%) had monocytopenia. All children recovered without sequelae. Children with SARS had significantly lower incidences of rhinorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.09), sputum production (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63), and sore throat (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85) than children with influenza. Both groups had similar incidences of leukopenia or lymphopenia, but SARS patients had a significantly higher incidence of monocytopenia (33% vs 0%, P = .04).

Three primary factors influence transfer: trainee characteristics, training design and work environment influences. Within medical education, the work environment factors influencing transfer of training remain underexplored. Burke and Hutchins review of training transfer outlined five work environment influences: opportunity to perform, supervisor/peer support, strategic link, transfer climate and accountability. This study aimed to explore the ways in which work environment factors influence the transfer of training for medical trainees. METHODS: Internal Medicine Training in Scotland includes a three-day boot camp involving simulation-based mastery learning of procedural skills, immersive simulation scenarios and communication workshops. Following ethical approval, trainees were invited to take part in interviews at least three months after following their boot camp. Interviews were semi-structured, anonymised, transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis. Member checking interviews were performed to verify findings. RESULTS: A total of 26 trainees took part in interviews between January 2020 and January 2021. Trainees reported a lack of opportunities to perform procedures in the workplace and challenges relating to the transfer climate, including a lack of appropriate equipment and resistance to change in the workplace. Trainees described a strong sense of personal responsibility to transfer and they felt empowered to change practice in response to the challenges faced. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights barriers to transfer of training within the clinical workplace including procedural opportunities, a transfer climate with challenging equipment availability and, at times, an unsupportive workplace culture. Trainees are driven by their own sense of personal responsibility; medical educators and healthcare leaders must harness this enthusiasm and take heed of the barriers to assist in the development of strategies to overcome them.

It has improved our understanding of sources of infection and transmission routes for important healthcare-associated pathogens, including Clostridioides difficile and Staphylococcus aureus. Transmission from known infected or colonised patients in hospitals may explain fewer cases than previously thought and multiple introductions of these pathogens from the community may play a greater a role. The findings have had important implications for infection prevention and control. Sequencing has identified heterogeneity within pathogen species, with some subtypes transmitting and persisting in hospitals better than others. It has identified sources of infection in healthcare-associated outbreaks of food-borne pathogens, Candida auris and Mycobacterium chimera, as well as individuals or groups involved in transmission and historical sources of infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequencing has been central to tracking variants during the COVID-19 pandemic and has helped understand transmission to and from patients and healthcare workers despite prevention efforts. Metagenomic sequencing is an emerging technology for culture-independent diagnosis of infection and antimicrobial resistance. In future, sequencing is likely to become more accessible and widely available. Real-time use in hospitals may allow infection prevention and control teams to identify transmission and to target interventions. It may also provide surveillance and infection control benchmarking. Attention to ethical and well-being issues arising from sequencing identifying individuals involved in transmission is important.

We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults. METHODS Infection with HMPV was identified in 3 prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons 19-40 years old, healthy adults > or =65 years old, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort for 4 consecutive winters (November 15 through April 15 for the years 1999 through 2003). The incidence and clinical impact were compared with those of influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus infection in the same groups. RESULTS Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and serologic testing, we identified HMPV infection in 2.2% to 10.5% of the 3 prospectively followed-up outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 38.8% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they occurred, were typical of an upper respiratory tract illness, although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized patients, HMPV was identified in 8.5% (range, 4.4%-13.2%), depending on the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to those for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection. CONCLUSIONS In adults of all ages, HMPV is a common infection, and, although often asymptomatic, it can result in serious infection that requires hospitalization.

However, some elderly and immune-compromised populations are unable to raise an effective immune response against traditional vaccines. AIMS: We hypothesised that passive immunity engineered by the in vivo expression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), an approach termed vectored-immunoprophylaxis (VIP), could offer sustained protection against COVID-19 in all populations irrespective of their immune status or age. METHODS: We developed three key reagents to evaluate VIP for SARS-CoV-2: (i) we engineered standard laboratory mice to express human ACE2 via rAAV9 in vivo gene transfer, to allow in vivo assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) to simplify in vivo challenge studies, we generated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vectors as a simple mimic of authentic SARS-CoV-2 that could be used under standard laboratory containment conditions and (iii) we developed in vivo gene transfer vectors to express anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. CONCLUSIONS: A single intranasal dose of rAAV9 or rSIV.F/HN vectors expressing anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 mimic infection in the lower respiratory tract of hACE2-expressing mice. If translated, the VIP approach could potentially offer a highly effective, long-term protection against COVID-19 for highly vulnerable populations; especially immune-deficient/senescent individuals, who fail to respond to conventional SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The in vivo expression of multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs could enhance protection and prevent rapid mutational escape.","output":"Lung directed antibody gene transfer confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac evaluations, including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and biomarker results, are needed in children during mid-term recovery after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of CMR abnormalities 1C3 months after recovery is over 50% in older adults and has ranged between 1 and 15% in college athletes. Abnormal cardiac biomarkers are common in adults, even during recovery. METHODS: We performed CMR imaging in a prospectively-recruited pediatric cohort recovered from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We obtained CMR data and serum biomarkers. We compared these results to age-matched control patients, imaged prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: CMR was performed in 17 children (13.9 years, all  18 years) and 29 age-matched control patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cases were recruited with symptomatic COVID-19 (11/17, 65%) or MIS-C (6/17, 35%) and studied an average of 2 months after diagnosis. All COVID-19 patients had been symptomatic with fever (73%), vomiting/diarrhea (64%), or breathing difficulty (55%) during infection. Left ventricular and right ventricular ejection fractions were indistinguishable between cases and controls (p = 0.66 and 0.70, respectively). Mean native global T1, global T2 values and segmental T2 maximum values were also not statistically different from control patients (p  0.06 for each). NT-proBNP and troponin levels were normal in all children.

The development of medicinal agents to treat PEDV infection is therefore crucial. In this study, antiviral activities against PEDV of ethanol and aqueous extracts of 17 Vietnamese traditional medicinal plants were evaluated using the cytopathic effect-based assay. The results showed that 14 out of 17 medicinal plants could inhibit the cytopathic effect of PEDV. The ethanol extract of Stixis scandens was identified as the most active extract with its MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) being 0.15 g/mL. Other plant extracts also displayed strong antiviral activity against PEDV, including Anisomeles indica, Pericampylus glaucus and Croton kongensis. The results demonstrate that certain medicinal plants have a high antiviral potential and may serve as a lead to develop novel pharmaceutical agents to cure PED as well as the diseases caused by other coronaviruses.","output":"In vitro antiviral activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts of Vietnamese traditional medicinal plants against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus: a coronavirus family member"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 was caused by a novel Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that infects humans through the binding of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 protein to the glycosylated ACE2 receptor. The spike 2 protein recognizes the N-terminal helices of the glycosylated metalloprotease domain in the human ACE2 receptor. To understand the susceptibility of animals for infection and transmission, we did sequence and structure-based molecular interaction analysis of 16 ACE2 receptors from different mammalian species with SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 receptor binding domain. Our comprehensive structure analysis revealed that the natural substitution of amino acid residues Gln24, His34, Phe40, Leu79 and Met82 in the N-terminal 1 and 2 helices of the ACE2 receptor results in loss of crucial network of hydrogen-bonded and hydrophobic interactions with receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Another striking observation is the absence of N-glycosylation site Asn103 in all mammals and many species, lack more than one N-linked glycosylation site in the ACE2 receptor. Based on the loss of crucial interactions and the absence of N-linked glycosylation sites we categorized Felis catus, Equus caballus, Panthera tigris altaica, as highly susceptible while Oryctolagus cuniculus, Bos Tauras, Ovis aries and Capra hircus as moderately susceptible species for infection. Similarly, the E. asinus, Bubalus bubalis, Canis lupus familiaris, Ailuropoda melaleuca and Camelus dromedarius are categorized as low susceptible with Loxodonta Africana, Mus musculus, Sus scrofa and Rattus rattus as least susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results: The COVID-19 crisis disrupted the inclusion of patients relatives in the ICU. Their inclusion had been established by various means before the crisis: 24-hour visits, participation in mortuary toilets, pets visits, logbooks, family lounges, and volunteer visits. These options led to better inclusion in the ICU, even if there were still difficulties: involving the patients loved ones during the acute phase, communicating with the visitors, waiting for care, choosing a healthcare proxy, and coping with restricted visiting hours. The COVID-19 crisis added barriers: the initial closure of all the wards in which the interviewed caregivers worked, followed by their partial reopening;a fear of the virus;equipment related constraints;exacerbated communication difficulties;and an extreme lack of medical time. The caregivers tried to implement new means of including relatives in this context: videoconferencing, virtual logbooks, and regular telephone interviews. However, the global context of the pandemic made it difficult for hospital professionals to accommodate the patients loved ones, thus deteriorating caregivers relationships with relatives, resulting in negative experiences for both relatives and caregivers.Conclusion: The COVID-19 crisis has made it challenging for caregivers to accommodate the relatives of hospitalised patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness (falls reduction) and cost-effectiveness, of a multi-professional medication review (MPMR) service in care homes for older people. METHOD A total of care homes in the East of England were cluster randomised to 'usual care' or two multi-professional (General practitioner, clinical pharmacist and care homes staff) medication reviews during the 12-month trial period. Target recruitment was 900 residents with 10% assumed loss to follow-up. Co-primary outcome measures were number of falls and potentially inappropriate prescribing assessed by the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions. KEY FINDINGS A total of 826 care home residents were recruited with 324 lost to follow-up for at least one primary outcome measure. The mean number of falls per resident per annum was 3.3 for intervention and 3.0 for control (P = 0.947). Each resident was found to be prescribed 0.69 (intervention) and 0.85 (control) potentially inappropriate medicines after 12 months (P = 0.046). No significant difference identified in emergency hospital admissions or deaths. Estimated unadjusted incremental mean cost per resident was 374.26 higher in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS In line with other medication review based interventions in care homes, two MPMRs improved medication appropriateness but failed to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes.

Objective: To examine the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of an intensive treatment programme containing prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, physical activities and psycho-education, delivered via home-based telehealth. Method: The treatment was carried out within four consecutive days during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of six (four female) patients suffering from severe or Complex PTSD resulting from exposure to multiple traumatic events, mostly during early childhood. Four of them fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of complex PTSD. Outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ). Results: CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment (Cohens ds 1.04 and 0.93), and from post-treatment to follow-up (Cohens ds 0.92 and 1.24). Four of the six patients lost their PTSD or Complex PTSD diagnostic status. No patient dropped out, no personal adverse events and no reliable symptom worsening occurred.

This is a retrospective investigation and no intervention was applied. The numbers are presented as mean  Standard Deviation (SD). We used Graphpad Prism (version 8.2.1 Windows version, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Fisher's exact test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 was used to identify potential risk factor (s) for intubation providers. A P value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. A total of 211 anesthesiologists from four provinces were involved in the intubation of 664 patients with confirmed or potential COVID-19. Of these 644 patients, 640 cases were eventually confirmed with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the 211 anesthesiologists who performed intubation, 10 of them had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 afterwards. Coughing is a risk factor for provider infection (P = 0.0001). The number of intubation attempts (within three attempts) did not increase the risk of the infection.

It is found that the physical structure of the waterways of Hongcun Village has been well preserved, but the water pollution caused by tourism, with a combination of changes of land use and demographic structure, has changed the functions and cultural meanings of waterways. Although there remains quite a daunting task towards sustainability in terms of technology, heritage protection, and desire for development, we claim the waterways environmental governance in which local governments play a crucial role in resilience strategies by controlling the sewage from homestays, restaurants, and pigment sewage from sketches. However, the ways in which landscape animates, including the daily lives, processual daily practices, and mundane activities of different social actors related to waterways, deserve further implementation to build the resilience of cultural landscape from the perspective of non-representational theory. This paper adds to a new narrative to the waterway landscape research by presenting a water utilization pattern that could profitably coexist with a specific environment in the Huizhou region in the agricultural society of ancient China and discussing how the non-representational theory contributes to analyzing and managing waterway landscapes in modern times.

Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations. RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patient's total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs. The interactive map can also aid in proactive planning and preparations among employers that are deemed critical, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities.","output":"Distribution of Patients at Risk for Complications Related to COVID-19 in the United States: Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Quebec prioritized in-person learning after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with school closures being implemented temporarily in selected schools or in hot-spot areas. Quebecs decision to keep most schools open was controversial, especially in Montreal, which was the epicenter of Canadas first and second waves; therefore, understanding the extent to which children were infected with SARS-CoV-2 provides important information for decisions about school closures. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children and teenagers in 4 neighborhoods of Montreal, Canada. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (the Enfants et COVID-19: tude de sroprvalence [EnCORE] study) enrolled a convenience sample of children aged 2 to 17 years between October 22, 2020, and March 22, 2021, in Montreal, Canada. EXPOSURES: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, collected using dried blood spots (DBSs) and analyzed with a research-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Parents also completed an online questionnaire that included questions on self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and tests, along with sociodemographic questions. RESULTS: This study included 1632 participants who provided a DBS sample from 30 day cares, 22 primary schools, and 11 secondary schools. The mean (SD) age of the children who provided a DBS sample was 9.0 (4.4) years; 801 (49%) were female individuals, with 354 participants (22%) from day cares, 725 (44%) from primary schools, and 553 (34%) from secondary schools. Most parents had at least a bachelors degree (1228 [75%]), and 210 (13%) self-identified as being a racial or ethnic minority. The mean seroprevalence was 5.8% (95% CI, 4.6%-7.0%) but increased over time from 3.2% (95% CI, 0.7%-5.8%) in October to November 2020 to 8.4% (95% CI, 4.4%-12.4%) in March to April 2021. Of the 95 children with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody results, 78 (82%) were not tested or tested negative with reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and all experienced mild (49 [52%]) or no clinical symptoms (46 [48%]). The children of parents who self-identified as belonging to a racial and ethnic minority group were more likely to be seropositive compared with children of White parents (adjusted seroprevalence ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results provide a benchmark of the seroprevalence status in Canadian children. The findings suggest that there was more transmission occurring in children compared with what was being detected by RT-PCR, although children experienced few or mild symptoms. It will be important to continue monitoring the serological status of children, particularly in the context of new COVID-19 variants of concern and in the absence of mass vaccination campaigns targeting young children.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Children in School and Day Care in Montreal, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020.

However, natura abhorret vacuum, and new pathogens come to replace disappearing ones. Over the past ten years, humanity has faced two pandemics: swine flu A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2019, providing scientists with a unique opportunity to learn more about a relationship between respiratory viruses and their pathogenesis. Together with viruses of pandemic significance, a large number of seasonal respiratory viruses circulate, which contribute to the structure of human morbidity, and coinfections aggravate the condition of the illness. In the conditions of the spread of new viruses with unexplored characteristics, in the absence of means of prevention and therapy, it is especially important to prevent the aggravation of morbidity due to mixed infections. Here we review the mutual involvement of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and seasonal respiratory viruses in the epidemic process, discuss some issues related to their spread, potential causes affecting the spread and severity of the morbidity. The given facts testify to the existence of seasonality and temporal patterns of the beginning and end of respiratory viruses circulation. Interestingly, the beginning of circulation of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus led to a shift in the timing and intensity of circulation of some respiratory viruses, which is probably caused by existence of replication conflicts between them, and did not affect others. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2-19 and other respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus and rhinoviruses, was quite often observed. At the current stage, no aggravating effect of influenza on the course of COVID-19 in mixed infection has been established. Whether this is due to the mild course of influenza infection in the 2020 epidemic season, or the competitive impact of SARS-CoV-2 on influenza viruses is not yet clear.

Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low-passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1 : P4 and Munich : P1) were cultured twice in Vero E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1 : P6 and minor variants in the Munich : P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies, we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titres in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal.

Operational challenges such as supply problems and personnel shortages have led to these bottlenecks and inhibited the scale-up of testing to needed levels. This paper uses operational simulations to facilitate rapid scale-up of testing capacity during this public health emergency. Specifically, discrete event simulation models were developed to represent the RT-PCR testing process in a large University of Maryland testing center, which retrofitted high-throughput molecular testing capacity to meet pandemic demands in a partnership with the State of Maryland. The simulation models support analyses that identify process steps which create bottlenecks, and evaluate what-if scenarios for process changes that could expand testing capacity. This enables virtual experimentation to understand the trade-offs associated with different interventions that increase testing capacity, allowing the identification of solutions that have high leverage at a feasible and acceptable cost. For example, using a virucidal collection medium which enables safe discarding of swabs at the point of collection removed a time-consuming deswabbing step (a primary bottleneck in this laboratory) and nearly doubled the testing capacity. The models are also used to estimate the impact of demand variability on laboratory performance and the minimum equipment and personnel required to meet various target capacities, assisting in scale-up for any laboratories following the same process steps. In sum, the results demonstrate that by using simulation modeling of the operations of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, preparedness planners are able to identify high-leverage process changes to increase testing capacity.","output":"Supporting scale-up of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing processes with discrete event simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article provides data on the embryogenesis of the eyeball, nasolacrimal canal and nasal cavity.

We sought to determine the use of adaptive designs in dialysis clinical trials and quantify trends in their use over time. STUDY DESIGN: We completed a novel full-text systematic review that used a machine learning classifier (RobotSearch) for filtering randomized controlled trials and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. SETTING & STUDY POPULATIONS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov using sensitive dialysis search terms. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We included all randomized clinical trials with patients receiving dialysis or clinical trials with dialysis as a primary or secondary outcome. There was no restriction of disease type or intervention type. DATA EXTRACTION & ANALYTICAL APPROACH: We performed a detailed data extraction of trial characteristics and a completed a narrative synthesis of the data. RESULTS: 57 studies, available as 68 articles and 7 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries, were included after full-text review (initial search, 209,033 PubMed abstracts and 6,002 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries). 31 studies were conducted in a dialysis population and 26 studies included dialysis as a primary or secondary outcome. Although the absolute number of adaptive design methods is increasing over time, the relative use of adaptive design methods in dialysis trials is decreasing over time (6.12% in 2009 to 0.43% in 2019, with a mean of 1.82%). Group sequential designs were the most common type of adaptive design method used. Adaptive design methods affected the conduct of 50.9% of trials, most commonly resulting in stopping early for futility (41.2%) and early stopping for safety (23.5%). Acute kidney injury was studied in 32 trials (56.1%), kidney failure requiring dialysis was studied in 24 trials (42.1%), and chronic kidney disease was studied in 1 trial (1.75%). 27 studies (47.4%) were supported by public funding. 44 studies (77.2%) did not report their adaptive design method in the title or abstract and would not be detected by a standard systematic review. LIMITATIONS: We limited our search to 2 databases (PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov) due to the scale of studies sourced (209,033 and 6,002 results, respectively).

This investigation aims to measure the utilization of health applications among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted in the Jazan region in Saudi Arabia between October 2020 and March 2021. Data were collected during interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire collected items about the patients demographics, morbidity, and use of electronic devices and health applications developed by the Saudi MoH. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with odds of reporting use of applications. RESULTS: A total of 658 patients were recruited. The mean age of the patients was 51 years, and 59% of them were females. The most frequently reported diagnosed condition was diabetes (53.5%), followed by hypertension (42.7%). Majority of the patients reported not using any health applications developed by the Saudi MoH (68.2%). Patients with higher educational levels and younger patients were more likely to report use of the applications (ORs: 4.2, 2.6 respectively). Comorbidity history and disease duration did not seem to influence the probability of reporting use of health applications (P-values >0.05).

In a previous study, we found that the seroprevalence in the adult population of Ischgl had reached 45% by the end of April, representing an exceptionally high level of local seropositivity in Europe. We performed a follow-up study in Ischgl, which is the first to show persistence of immunity and protection against SARS-CoV-2 and some of its variants at a community level. Methods Of the 1259 adults that participated in the baseline study, 801 have been included in the follow-up in November 2020. The study involved the analysis of binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. In addition, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in Ischgl was compared to the incidence in similar municipalities in Tyrol until April 2021. Findings For the 801 individuals that participated in both studies, the seroprevalence declined from 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9C54.9) to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0C49.0). Median antibody concentrations dropped considerably (5.345, 95% CI 4.833 C 6.123 to 2.298, 95% CI 2.141 C 2.527) but antibody avidity increased (17.02, 95% CI 16.49 C 17.94 to 42.46, 95% CI 41.06 C 46.26). Only one person had lost detectable antibodies and T cell responses. In parallel to this persistent immunity, we observed that Ischgl was relatively spared, compared to similar municipalities, from the prominent second COVID-19 wave that hit Austria in November 2020. In addition, we used sequencing data to show that the local immunity acquired from wild-type infections also helped to curb infections from variants of SARS-CoV-2 which spread in Austria since January 2021. Interpretation The relatively high level of seroprevalence (40C45%) in Ischgl persisted and might have been associated with the observed protection of Ischgl residents against virus infection during the second COVID-19 wave as well as against variant spread in 2021.

WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates. METHODS: A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for 15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 40 days (IQR 23C43) and the median serial interval was 40 days (30C50). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 750% (95% CI 190C990; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 100% (12C320; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 51% (26C89; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts. INTERPRETATION: Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

However, the active constituents in it that parasitize different hosts vary, affecting its clinical efficacy. Given the complexity of the host origins, evaluating the quality of TAXH is critical to ensure the safety and effectiveness of clinical medication. In the present study, a quantitative method based on ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UFLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) was established, which simultaneously determined the content of 33 active constituents, including 12 flavonoids, 4 organic acids, 12 amino acids, and 5 nucleosides in 45 samples. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to classify and distinguish between TAXH and its adulterants, Tolypanthi Herba (TOLH). A hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was conducted combined with a heatmap to visually observe the distribution regularity of 33 constituents in each sample. Furthermore, gray relational analysis (GRA) was applied to evaluate the quality of samples to get the optimal host. The results demonstrated that TAXH excelled TOLH in quality as a whole. The quality of TAXH parasitizing Morus alba was also better, while those that were parasitic on Cinnamomum camphora and Glyptostrobus pensilis had relatively poor quality.

The state of carbohydrate metabolism in patients with COVID-19 has not been sufficiently studied in clinical studies. In isolated studies, it is noted that infection with the virus may be accompanied by an increase in the concentration of glycated hemoglobin in patients with viral pneumonia.Objective. Estimation of the hyperglycemia incidence and cases of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus in patients with COV-ID-19 and acute pulmonary lesions aged 4180 years hospitalized in a repurposed infectious diseases hospital in Moscow with a diagnosis of pneumonia.Material and methods. The observational study analyzed laboratory and clinical diagnostic data of 278 patients (163 men and 115 women) aged 4180 years who did not have signs of impaired glucose tolerance and manifest diabetes ac-cording to the history and medical reports presented. They were admitted to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment in the period from 04/12/2020 to 11/10/2020 with a diagnosis according to ICD-10: U07.1 Coronavirus infection. In the selected groups of patients, the initial and subsequent fasting blood glucose levels were analyzed after 8 hours of fasting determined using a stationary automatic analyzer. The concentration of glucose and ketones in urine was determined by a semi-quantitative method. The dynamics of indicators was assessed in identifying pathological values of glucose concentration. The glucose level above 6.1 mmol/L was taken as pathological.Results. In patients aged 4180 years hospitalized with a new coronavirus infection and pneumonia, fasting hyperglycemia was di-agnosed in 3451% of cases, glucosuria  in 1.96.1%, ketonuria  in 20.446.2%. In 63.374.3% of cases in patients with COVID-19 after treatment and regression of changes in the lungs the glucose levels were normalized;in 15.416.7% of cases the changes persisted;in 913% of patients after additional investigation the diabetes was newly diagnosed. Hyperglycemia was detected significantly more often in patients with arterial hypertension of the 23rd degree and with a tendency to significance  in patients with obesity of 23rd degree. Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and specific changes in lipid metabolism with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes were significantly often diagnosed in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with acute and chronic lung pathology without proven infection with SARS-CoV-2 but only in the group of patients aged 4160.Conclusion.

T cell immunogenicity towards peptides is contingent on binding to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules of the given individual. HLA is highly polymorphic, and each variant typically presents a different repertoire of peptides. This polymorphism combined with pathogen diversity challenges the rational selection of peptide sets with broad immunogenic potential and population coverage. Here we propose PopCover-2.0, a simple yet highly effective method, for resolving this challenge. The method takes as input a set of (predicted) CD8 and/or CD4 T cell epitopes with associated HLA restriction and pathogen strain annotation together with information on HLA allele frequencies, and identifies peptide sets with optimal pathogen and HLA (class I and II) coverage. PopCover-2.0 was benchmarked on historic data in the context of HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Further, the immunogenicity of the selected SARS-CoV-2 peptides was confirmed by experimentally validating the peptide pools for T cell responses in a panel of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In summary, PopCover-2.0 is an effective method for rational selection of peptide subsets with broad HLA and pathogen coverage.

This study focuses on the development of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing. We discuss the flow structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far-field wake. Vorticity is introduced from the wing surface into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional manner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three dimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings (), the wake remains stable due to the strong tip-vortex induced downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops. For higher-aspect-ratio wings (), the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the midspan region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the unsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is found to be related to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high angles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge near the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis performed in this paper reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force distributions.","output":"On the formation of three-dimensional separated flows over wings under tip effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections usually result in alterations in the host cell proteome, which determine the fate of infected cells and the progress of pathogenesis.

All patients had at least 3 months of follow-up, and those who underwent combined surgeries were excluded. Ulcers were assessed at baseline and then at 72 hours, 1 month, and 3 months. Population demographics, follow-up time, ulcer etiologies, epithelial defect size, ulcer depth, and complications were also recorded. RESULTS Baseline characteristics and clinical features of both groups were comparable. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of overlay AM transplantations (P = 0.52) or early detachments (P = 0.57). At 3 months, the corneal healing rate was almost the same in both groups (89% and 91% for FD-AM and C-AM, respectively; P = 0.87). Complications were equally uncommon (11% and 9%, respectively; P = 0.92). In logistic regression, the type of the membrane did not influence corneal healing at 1 month (P = 0.42) or 3 months (P = 0.99), regardless of the depth of the ulcer. However, whatever the type of AM used, the deeper the ulcer was, the less likely it was to heal at 3 months (P = 0.02).

METHODS: Surviving SARS patients were seen at least twice within 3 months after discharge and underwent SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody testing, pulmonary function testing, and chest radiography and/or high-resolution CT (HRCT) examinations at Chinese PLA General Hospital. The treatments received at Xiaotangshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively and were correlated to later status. RESULTS: Positive SARS-Co virus IgG antibody results were seen in 208 of 258 patients, with 21.3% (55 of 258 patients) still having a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco < 80% of predicted). By comparing the 155 survivors with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and Dlco  80% predicted with the 50 patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results, we found that 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality had endured a much longer course of fever and received larger doses of glucocorticoid, as well as higher ratios of oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation treatment. For these patients, 51 of 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality underwent pulmonary function testing after approximately 1 month.

METHODS Objective and subjective outcomes were assessed by radiological and endoscopic methods, symptom questionnaire and quality-of-life index at a minimum follow-up of 12 (mean 758) months. RESULTS The study included 129 consecutive patients who had laparoscopic redo surgery after fundoplication had failed. The most frequent patterns of failure were hiatal herniation (50 patients) and slippage (45). Resolution of the symptoms that led to redo surgery was achieved in 27 of 37 and 11 of 16 patients operated for recurrence and for dysphagia respectively. Objective failure was demonstrated in 16 of 39 patients with herniation and six of 22 with slippage. Seven patients underwent an additional surgical procedure. CONCLUSION Long-term assessment of objective and subjective results after laparoscopic repair for failed fundoplication revealed a high failure rate that increased with the length of follow-up. Unexpected and untreated oesophageal shortening may be responsible for this failure rate.","output":"Long-term results after laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 epidemic in China, elderly and multimorbid subjects showed a higher mortality rate However, other factors could influence the mortality and the spread of contagion such as the population density An archival research based on the Italian data stratified by region was performed in order to quantify the association between the population density, ageing index, number of positive cases, number of deaths, case-fatality rate, and medical equipment (gloves, masks, and ventilators) Results showed a significant positive linear relationship between the population density and cases, deaths, and case-fatality rate No correlation with the ageing index was shown Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation between the number of medical supplies and population density, cases, and deaths However, the medical supplies did not show any correlation with the case-fatality rate Taken together, these findings suggest that the population density and the lack of medical equipment are key factors explaining morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in Italy","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Italy: Population Density correlates with Morbidity and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A large number of studies have explored the association between frailty and mortality among COVID-19 patients, with inconsistent results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on this issue. METHODS: Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to 20th January 2021 were searched for relevant literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality bias, and STATA was employed to pool the effect size by a random effects model. Additionally, potential publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 23,944 COVID-19 patients, for quantitative analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of frailty was 51% (95% CI: 44-59%). Patients with frailty who were infected with COVID-19 had an increased risk of mortality compared to those without frailty, and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.78-3.46), respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis based on population showed that the pooled ORs for hospitalized patients in eight studies and nursing home residents in two studies were 2.62 (95% CI: 1.68-4.07) and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.40-3.11), respectively. Subgroup analysis using the frailty assessment tool indicated that this association still existed when using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) (assessed in 6 studies, pooled OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.52-5.45; assessed in 5 studies, pooled HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and other frailty tools (assessed in 4 studies, pooled OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.81-2.16). In addition, these significant positive associations still existed in the subgroup analysis based on study design and geographic region. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that frailty is an independent predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Thus, frailty could be a prognostic factor for clinicians to stratify high-risk groups and remind doctors and nurses to perform early screening and corresponding interventions urgently needed to reduce mortality rates in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Frailty as a predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-cigarette use has been increasing among middle school students. Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students.

In the current study, two simulations were used, one based on retrospectively collected data (literature-based) on pertussis cases and another one on a synthetic data set created by the researchers. The sensitivity, specificity, false alarm, and false-negative rate, positive and negative likelihood ratios, under ROC areas and median timeliness were used to assess the performance of the methods. RESULTS In a literature-based outbreak simulation, the highest and lowest sensitivity, false negative in the detection of injected outbreaks were seen in Daubechies 10 (db10), with sensitivity 0.59 (0.56-0.62), and Haar wavelets with 0.57 (0.54-0.60). In the researcher simulated data, the EWMA (K=0.5) with sensitivity 0.92 (0.90-0.94) had the best performance.

We previously demonstrated that prophylaxis with a multimechanistic monoclonal antibody (MAb) combination against alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) and ClfA (11H10) provided greater strain coverage and improved efficacy in an S. aureus lethal bacteremia model. Subsequently, 11H10 was found to exhibit reduced affinity and impaired inhibition of fibrinogen binding to ClfA002 expressed by members of a predominant hospital-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clone, ST5. Consequently, we identified another anti-ClfA MAb (SAR114) from human tonsillar B cells with >100-fold increased affinity for three prominent ClfA variants, including ClfA002, and potent inhibition of bacterial agglutination by 112 diverse clinical isolates. We next constructed bispecific Abs (BiSAbs) comprised of 11H10 or SAR114 as IgG scaffolds and grafted anti-alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) single-chain variable fragment to the amino or carboxy terminus of the anti-ClfA heavy chains. Although the BiSAbs exhibited in vitro potencies similar to those of the parental MAbs, only 11H10-BiSAb, but not SAR114-BiSAb, showed protective activity in murine infection models comparable to the respective MAb combination. In vivo activity with SAR114-BiSAb was observed in infection models with S. aureus lacking ClfA. Our data suggest that high-affinity binding to ClfA sequesters the SAR114-BiSAb to the bacterial surface, thereby reducing both alpha-toxin neutralization and protection in vivo.

Using mathematical and computational methods, the applied tool was developed to analyze and manage the COVID-19 pandemic (from an epidemiological point of view), with a particular focus on population heterogeneity in terms of age, susceptibility, and symptom severity. We show improved strategies to prevent an epidemic outbreak. We evaluated the model in three countries, obtaining an average mean square error of 0.067 over a full month of the basic reproduction number (R0). The goal of this study is to create a theoretical framework for crisis management that integrates accumulated epidemiological considerations.

If the virus enters a feed mill, it becomes widely distributed and is difficult to decontaminate from both feed contact and non-feed contact surfaces. The objective of this study was to evaluate a variety of liquid and dry decontamination treatments that could be used to reduce the amount of PEDV found on feed manufacturing surfaces. This experiment was designed as a 5  10 factorial with five different feed manufacturing surfaces and 10 decontamination treatments with three replicates of each combination. Surfaces included stainless steel, solid polyethylene, woven polypropylene tote bag, rubber, and sealed concrete coupons. One mL (110(5) TCID(50)/mL) of stock PEDV was applied to each surface and allowed to dry completely for 60 min. Next, for decontamination requiring surface application, the application was performed and allowed 15 min contact time. The quantity of PEDV RNA was determined using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. A decontamination treatment  surface interaction was observed (P < 0.0001), indicating the efficacy of treatment is dependent upon the surface in which it is applied. Within the cement surfaces, the sodium hypochlorite resulted in the greatest (P < 0.05) cycle threshold (Ct) value, followed by formaldehyde which had a greater (P < 0.05) Ct value compared to remaining treatments. Within polyethylene, rubber, and stainless steel surfaces, the formaldehyde treated surfaces had the greatest Ct values (P < 0.05), followed by the sodium hypochlorite treatment, with other treatments all having lower Ct values (P < 0.05).

This warrants exploration of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the case series during the initial passive case detection phase in Sri Lanka, in order to understand the success in containment of the disease for more than nine months in the country through its initial early and rapid pandemic response. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using secondary data (hospital records and investigation reports) extracted from all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to the three main state-sector hospitals in Sri Lanka from 11 March to 7 April 2020. Clinical outcomes were categorized as mild, severe and critical, as per the international classification. Kruskal-Wallis H, Mann Whitney U and Fishers exact tests compared differences between the variables. RESULTS: The case series comprised 146 live discharges and six deaths. Majority were males (63.2%); mean age of 40.9 (SD = 17.9); and symptomatic (72.4%). Sixty-one (40.1%) had co-morbidities, the commonest being diabetes (20.4%) and hypertension (17.8%). Mild (93.4%), severe (2.6%) and critical (4.0%) disease outcomes were noted. Disease severity was significantly higher with older age (p = 0.037), co-morbidities (p = 0.026); and higher white-cell (p = 0.045) and lymphocyte (p = 0.043) counts; but not with being symptomatic (p = 0.683). The commonest symptoms were fever (62.5%), dry cough (48.0%) and sore throat (26.9%). The median duration (IQR) was 3.0 (1.0C5.0) and 18.0 (15.0C29.5) days, respectively before and during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to high-risk countries, the younger age, milder disease and low mortality observed in local patients during the initial phase of the pandemic, reflect the early success in containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka. However, once the disease becomes severe, the factors determining disease fatality remain the same as in other countries. This highlights the value of establishing strong public health systems and disease surveillance in a country, which could provide long-term effects on disease control.","output":"Sri Lankas early success in the containment of COVID-19 through its rapid response: Clinical & epidemiological evidence from the initial case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review provides a detailed look at the attributes and immunologic mechanisms of plasmid DNA vaccines and their utility as laboratory tools as well as potential human vaccines. The immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccines in a variety of preclinical models is used to illustrate how they differ from traditional vaccines in novel ways due to the in situ antigen production and the ease with which they are constructed. The ability to make new DNA vaccines without needing to handle a virulent pathogen or to adapt the pathogen for manufacturing purposes demonstrates the potential value of this vaccine technology for use against emerging and epidemic pathogens. Similarly, personalized anti-tumor DNA vaccines can also readily be made from a biopsy. Because DNA vaccines bias the T-helper (Th) cell response to a Th1 phenotype, DNA vaccines are also under development for vaccines against allergy and autoimmune diseases. The licensure of four animal health products, including two prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, one immunotherapy for cancer, and one gene therapy delivery of a hormone for a food animal, provides evidence of the efficacy of DNA vaccines in multiple species including horses and pigs. The size of these target animals provides evidence that the somewhat disappointing immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in a number of human clinical trials is not due simply to the larger mass of humans compared with most laboratory animals. The insights gained from the mechanisms of protection in the animal vaccines, the advances in the delivery and expression technologies for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines, and encouragingly potent human immune responses in certain clinical trials, provide insights for future efforts to develop DNA vaccines into a broadly useful vaccine and immunotherapy platform with applications for human and animal health.","output":"DNA vaccines: an historical perspective and view to the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is necessary to understand early perception, behavior, and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventive practices in relation to suggested policies and information accessible to the Palestinian population during the early stages of the pandemic.

Whole genome sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignment, from which Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the general time reversible model. Of the 227 genetic sequences obtained for 9 African countries (DRC=133, Senegal=23, South Africa=20, Ghana=15, Tunisia=6, Algeria=3, Gambia=3, Egypt=2 and Nigeria=2), 220 were whole genome sequences while 7 were partial genome sequences of the surface glycoprotein S.

The very close alignment of three viruses - Ghana/1659_S14/2020;EPI_ISL_422405 , DRC/KN0054/2020;EPI_ISL_417437 , and South_Africa/R05475/2020;EPI_ISL_435059 C to the reference Wuhan strain on the time tree, suggests possible introduction and circulation of the virus into the continent much earlier than when the first case was announced on February 15 2020. In conclusion, this study provided evidence to support multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Africa, and further suggests that the virus may have already been circulating in the continent prior to official reporting of the first case. Also, there is strong impression to infer likely genetic adaptation of the virus in the continent that may account for the close clustering of isolates from different countries.","output":"Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses of COVID-19 in Africa using open-source sequence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we study the trending behaviour of COVID-19 data at country level, and draw attention to some existing econometric tools which are potentially helpful to understand the trend better in future studies.

In this review, the importance of performing clinical autopsies in people dying from cardiovascular disease, even in the era of advanced cardiovascular imaging is addressed. Autopsies are most helpful in the setting of sudden unexpected deaths, particularly when advanced cardiovascular imaging has not been performed. In this setting, the autopsy is often the only chance to make the correct diagnosis. In previously symptomatic patients who had undergone advanced cardiovascular imaging, autopsies still play many roles. Post-mortem examinations are important for furthering the understanding of key issues related to the underlying diseases. Autopsy can help to increase the knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of advanced cardiovascular imaging modalities. Autopsies are particularly important to gain insights into both the natural history of cardiovascular diseases as well as less common presentations and therapeutic complications.

Cryo-EM structures of the WT and MT S-Trimers, determined at 3.2 ? and 2.6 ? respectively, revealed that both antigens adopt a tightly closed conformation and their structures are essentially identical to that of the previously solved full-length WT S protein in detergent. The tightly closed conformation is stabilized by fatty acid and polysorbate 80 binding at the receptor binding domains (RBDs) and the N terminal domains (NTDs) respectively. Additionally, we identified an important pH switch in the WT S-Trimer that shows dramatic conformational change and accounts for its increased stability at lower pH.

According to the guidelines, the routine treatment group was recommended to receive lopinavir/ritonavir 500 mg + &#945;-aerosolized interferon 500104 U, twice daily; the artesunate treatment group was given artesunate 60 mg, twice daily besides the routine treatment, for 10 days in both groups. During the treatment period, the pharynx swab test of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid was carried out every 2 days, and the routine blood test, liver and kidney functions, blood coagulation function and myocardial enzymes were re-examined. Chest CT was checked every 3 days after the treatment, and re-examined every 5 days after the condition was improved. The routine blood test and biochemical results of two groups were observed, and the efficacy evaluation was performed by monitoring the time for significant improvement of symptoms, negative conversion time of throat swab virus nucleic acid, lung lesion absorption time, adverse drug reactions and the length of hospital stay of the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, body weight, routine blood test and biochemical results before treatment. In artesunate treatment group, the time for significant improvement of symptoms (days: 3.331.91 vs. 4.842.19), negative conversion time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (days: 4.722.16 vs. 6.683.76), lung lesion absorption starting time (days: 5.392.36 vs. 7.483.78), lung lesion absorption greater than 70% time (days: 14.114.16 vs. 17.044.42) and the length of hospital stay (days: 16.563.71 vs. 18.043.97) were significantly shorter than those in routine treatment group, with significant differences (all P < 0.05).

A major innovation compared to the existing model programme was the introduction of thematic focuses. A longitudinal communication skills curriculum was integrated into the new thematic focus professional and personal development C inner work (IAP). With the start of the new programme, the IAP curriculum has been built step-by-step over time, i.e. the first four semesters have already been implemented, the following semesters are being planned. Project description: IAP aims to provide students with patient-centred medicine. Five areas of competence were defined: Doctor-patient communication, team competence, staying healthy, my paths to becoming a doctor, medicine and society. The focus of this article is on the communication curriculum. The first year of study focusses on the training of basic communication skills. In the 2(nd) year of study, students practice these basic skills in small groups with simulated patients (SP), whereby the emphasis in the 3(rd) semester is on history taking and in the 4(th) semester is on sharing information. In the 3(rd) semester, students complete a communication station in an OSCE. From the 5(th) semester onwards, the focus of training is on the consolidation of basic and advanced communication skills, which can be applied in clinical clerkships, and the reflection of clinical experiences. Key didactic elements are, in addition to teaching the theoretical basics, experience-based small group work with and without SP, feedback and reflection. The evaluation of the summer semester 2020 showed high agreement ratings of the students regarding the overall satisfaction with the individual courses (83-100% agreement). Discussion: The introduction of IAP has been very positively received by the students. Challenges are the adequate handling of the increasing student workload when planning new courses, the implementation of a longitudinal e-portfolio as well as the recruitment and training of clinical teachers and SPs. Conclusion: As the evaluation results of the summer semester 2020 show, the first steps of implementing a longitudinal communication curriculum at UW/H have been successful. Helpful strategies were the orientation on published examples from other faculties as well as regular feedback and discussions with students and teachers in order to adapt and integrate educational considerations into the existing model programme in Witten.","output":"Communicative competencies anchored longitudinally C the curriculum personal and professional development in the model study programme in undergraduate medical education at the University of Witten/Herdecke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental factor(s), such as viral infection, has been implicated as one of the triggering events leading to neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis.

Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were imaged by [(18)F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET/CT). Whole-body [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT, performed according to good clinical practice, was qualitatively (comparison with background/liver) and semi-quantitatively (target-to-blood pool ratio calculated as average SUVmax artery/average SUVmean inferior vena cava) analyzed. Negative follow-up [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT images of oncologic patients matched for age/sex served as controls. Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences between groups. SPSS version 26 was used for analyses. RESULTS: Ten recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients (seven male and three females, median age 52 years, range 46C80) with persisting symptoms were enrolled in the study. Common findings at visual analysis were increased [(18)F]FDG uptake in bone marrow and blood vessels (8/10 and 6/10 cases, respectively). [(18)F]FDG uptake in bone marrow did not differ between cases and controls (p = 0.16). The total vascular score was similar in the two groups (p = 0.95). The target-to-blood pool ratio resulted higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients than in controls. CONCLUSION: Although the total vascular score was similar in the two groups, the target-to-blood pool ratio was significantly higher in three vascular regions (thoracic aorta, right iliac artery, and femoral arteries) in the recovered COVID-19 cohort than in controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 induces vascular inflammation, which may be responsible for persisting symptoms.","output":"Vasculitis changes in COVID-19 survivors with persistent symptoms: an [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We synthesized a biodegradable, elastomeric, and functionalizable polyurethane (PU) that can be electrospun for use as a scaffold in soft tissue engineering. The PU was synthesized from polycaprolactone diol, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA) chain extender using two-step polymerization and designated as PU-DMPA. A control PU using 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) as a chain extender was synthesized similarly and designated as PU-BDO. The chemical structure of the two PUs was verified by FT-IR and (1)H-NMR. The PU-DMPA had a lower molecular weight than the PU-BDO (~16,700 Da vs. ~78,600 Da). The melting enthalpy of the PU-DMPA was greater than that of the PU-BDO. Both the PUs exhibited elastomeric behaviors with a comparable elongation at break ([Formula: see text] 13.2). The PU-DMPA had a higher initial modulus (19.8 MPa vs. 8.7 MPa) and a lower linear modulus (0.7 MPa vs. 1.2 MPa) and ultimate strength (9.5 MPa vs. 13.8 MPa) than the PU-BDO. The PU-DMPA had better hydrophilicity than the PU-BDO. Both the PUs displayed no cytotoxicity, although the adhesion of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells on the PU-DMPA surface was better. Bead free electrospun PU-DMPA membranes with a narrow fiber diameter distribution were successfully fabricated. As a demonstration of its functionalizability, gelatin was conjugated to the electrospun PU-DMPA membrane using carbodiimide chemistry. Moreover, hyaluronic acid was immobilized on the amino-functionalized PU-DMPA. In conclusion, the PU-DMPA has the potential to be used as a scaffold material for soft tissue engineering.","output":"Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrospinning of a Functionalizable, Polycaprolactone-Based Polyurethane for Soft Tissue Engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency events require early detection, quick response, and accurate recovery. In the era of big data, social media users can be seen as social sensors to monitor real-time emergency events. This paper proposed an integrated approach to detect all four kinds of emergency events early, including natural disasters, man-made accidents, public health events, and social security events. First, the BERT-Att-BiLSTM model is used to detect emergency-related posts from massive and irrelevant data. Then, the 3 W attribute information (what, where, and when) of the emergency event is extracted. With the 3 W attribute information, we create an unsupervised dynamical event clustering algorithm based on text similarity and combine it with the supervised logistical regression model to cluster posts into different events. Experiments on Sina Weibo data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Case studies on some real emergency events show that the proposed framework has good performance and high timeliness. Practical applications of the framework are also discussed, followed by future directions for improvement.","output":"Early detection of emergency events from social media: a new text clustering approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Viral respiratory tract infections (VRI) are a major reason for hospitalization in children younger than 5 years. A case control study was conducted to investigate the potential role of breastfeeding in protecting children <1 year of age from VRI. Methods: Patients admitted for a respiratory tract infections routinely underwent a nasopharyngeal aspirate, which was tested with an RT-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses. Hospitalized infants positive for viruses were enrolled as cases; healthy controls were enrolled among patients admitted for ultrasound hip screening. The effect of breastfeeding on pertussis was investigated through multivariable analysis. Results: We enrolled a total of 496 patients: 238 cases and 258 healthy controls. Among cases, eighty-six patients (36.1%) had a rinovirus, 78 (32.8%) an RSV, 22 (9.2%) an adenovirus, and 37 (15.5%) a coinfections with multiple viruses. The number of households was significantly higher in cases (mean in cases 4.5; mean 3.7 in controls, p < 0.001) and the proportion of infants having siblings (79% in cases vs. 43% in controls, p < 0.001). Proportion of smoking mothers was higher in cases than in controls (21.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Among cases 44.5% were exclusively breastfed at symptoms onset vs. 48.8% of healthy controls. According to the multivariable analysis, being exclusively breastfed at symptom onset was associated with a higher risk of viral respiratory infection (3.7; 95% CI 1.64C8.41), however a longer breastfeeding duration was protective (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97C0.99). Also having at least one sibling was associated to a higher risk (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.14C5.92) as well as having a smoking mother (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.33C4.89). Conclusions: Breastfeeding remains a mainstay of prevention for numerous diseases and its protective role increases with duration. However, being breastfed when mothers carry a respiratory infection may increase the risk of transmission, acting as a proxy for closer contacts. In future studies, potential confounding variables as pattern of contacts with other individuals, should be taken into account.","output":"Breastfeeding and Respiratory Infections in the First 6 Months of Life: A Case Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNAs are a powerful therapeutic class.

Circularization of RNA has been demonstrated as a means to improve persistence, however simple and scalable approaches to achieve this are lacking.

This approach enables icRNA delivery as simple linear RNA that is circularized upon delivery into the cell, thus making them compatible with routine synthesis, purification, and delivery formulations. We confirmed extensive protein translation from icRNAs both in vitro and in vivo and explored their utility in three contexts: first, we delivered the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein in vivo as icRNAs and showed corresponding induction of humoral immune responses; second, we demonstrated robust genome targeting via zinc finger nucleases delivered as icRNAs; and third, to enable compatibility between persistence of expression and immunogenicity, we developed a novel long range multiplexed (LORAX) protein engineering methodology to screen progressively deimmunized Cas9 proteins, and demonstrated efficient genome and epigenome targeting via their delivery as icRNAs.

Pain is mainly characterized by pain intensity and may induce disability in all areas of daily life. Nevertheless, pain is influenced by emotional and social factors as well. Social distancing measures or quarantine, as reaction to rapidly rising infections with the COVID-19 virus due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, were implemented across Europe to prevent the spread of the virus and social distancing measures were imposed by the German government by beginning of March 2020 with initiation of the lockdown by the end of March 2020. The objective of this study was to assess, how social distancing measures during the lockdown impacted the various aspects of pain perception in a group of chronic pain patients, such as women suffering from endometriosis. Methods: Between 6th to 27th April 2020, an online questionnaire was activated at internet platforms of endometriosis patients support groups. Participants were asked retrospectively at one time point about their visual pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and pain disability via pain disability index (PDI) prior to initiation of social distancing measures in Germany (VASP, PDIP), as well as the pain intensity and pain disability since implementation of social distancing measures (VASI, PDII). Differences of VAS and PDI previous and after implementation of social distancing measures were displayed as DELTAVAS and DELTAPDI. Pain experience and social support were assessed by a 5-point Likert scale. Results: 285 participants completed at least one question regarding pain intensity, disability, pain experience or social support. Dysmenorrhea, the symptom with the highest level of pain assessed by VAS, decreased significantly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compared to the time period prior to social isolation (45.30% respondents experienced improvemenet vs 40.50% who experienced worsening;p = 0.025). The global physical impairment improved significantly (improvement of pain induced disability in 48.20% vs 40.90% with worsening of pain symptoms;p = 0.032) after the implementation of social distancing measures. Pain experience was negatively affected by social distancing measures, since frequency of pain awareness increased in 43.6% (p < 0.001) of participants and 30.0% (p < 0.001) more participants experienced pain as a threat. Verbalization of pain experience was reduced in 36.6% (p = 0.001) of participants and 14.6% (p = 0.91), 21.9% (p < 0.001) and 31.5% (p < 0.001) of participants reported less social support from their partner, family and friends.

To gain some insight into these questions, the work at hand looks at five COVID vaccine development companies and evaluates their correlations over the development of the vaccine as well as after the rollout start. The process was conducted by using python including various libraries. The result of this analysis was that there is a significant correlation between the Google Trend data and the respective stock prices (retrieved from yahoo!

Scalable conversational agents, designed to assist health care professionals, may play a significant role in supporting this collaboration in a scalable way by reaching out to the everyday lives of patients and their family members. However, to date, it remains unclear whether conversational agents, in such a role, would be accepted and whether they can support this multistakeholder collaboration. OBJECTIVE: With asthma in children representing a relevant target of chronic disease management, this study had the following objectives: (1) to describe the design of MAX, a conversational agentCdelivered asthma intervention that supports health care professionals targeting child-parent teams in their everyday lives; and (2) to assess the (a) reach of MAX, (b) conversational agentCpatient working alliance, (c) acceptance of MAX, (d) intervention completion rate, (e) cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and (f) human effort and responsiveness of health care professionals in primary and secondary care settings. METHODS: MAX was designed to increase cognitive skills (ie, knowledge about asthma) and behavioral skills (ie, inhalation technique) in 10-15-year-olds with asthma, and enables support by a health professional and a family member. To this end, three design goals guided the development: (1) to build a conversational agentCpatient working alliance; (2) to offer hybrid (human- and conversational agentCsupported) ubiquitous coaching; and (3) to provide an intervention with high experiential value. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, asthma experts, and young patients with their parents developed the intervention collaboratively. The conversational agent communicates with health care professionals via email, with patients via a mobile chat app, and with a family member via SMS text messaging. A single-arm feasibility study in primary and secondary care settings was performed to assess MAX. RESULTS: Results indicated an overall positive evaluation of MAX with respect to its reach (49.5%, 49/99 of recruited and eligible patient-family member teams participated), a strong patient-conversational agent working alliance, and high acceptance by all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, MAX led to improved cognitive and behavioral skills and an intervention completion rate of 75.5%. Family members supported the patients in 269 out of 275 (97.8%) coaching sessions. Most of the conversational turns (99.5%) were conducted between patients and the conversational agent as opposed to between patients and health care professionals, thus indicating the scalability of MAX. In addition, it took health care professionals less than 4 minutes to assess the inhalation technique and 3 days to deliver related feedback to the patients. Several suggestions for improvement were made. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that conversational agents, designed as mediating social actors involving health care professionals, patients, and family members, are not only accepted in such a team player role but also show potential to improve health-relevant outcomes in chronic disease management.","output":"Conversational Agents as Mediating Social Actors in Chronic Disease Management Involving Health Care Professionals, Patients, and Family Members: Multisite Single-Arm Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 is best known as a respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic disease manifestations including coagulopathies.

The EpiShuttle is a patient transport system that was developed to fit into an air ambulance. A validated decontamination procedure is required before the system can be adopted in the UK. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) vapour fumigation may offer better penetration of the inaccessible parts than the liquid disinfectant wiping that is currently suggested. To validate this, an EpiShuttle was fumigated in a sealed test chamber. Commercial bacterial spore indicators (BIs), alongside organic liquid suspensions and dried surface samples of MS2 bacteriophage (a safe virus surrogate), were placed in and around the EpiShuttle, for the purpose of evaluation. The complete kill of all of the BIs in the five test runs demonstrated the efficacy of the fumigation cycle. The log reduction of the MS2 that was dried on the coupons ranged from 2.66 to 4.50, but the log reduction of the MS2 that was in the organic liquids only ranged from 0.07 to 1.90, confirming the results of previous work. Fumigation with H(2)O(2) alone may offer insufficient inactivation of viruses in liquid droplets, therefore a combination of fumigation and disinfectant surface wiping was proposed.

Genome-wide annotation of thousands of genomes revealed that more than 1,407 nucleotide mutations and 722 amino acids replacements occurred at different positions of the SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Drawing on county-level reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since February 2020, we calculated the number of excess deaths per county compared to 2018. Starting with a balanced panel dataset of county observations over time, we used coarsened exact matching to create a smaller but more similar set of communities which differ primarily in terms of social capital.

This study analysed the response of F81 cells to CPV infection at successive infection time points by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during 60 h of infection and at selected time points post-infection were identified by an analysis of variance test and a two-tailed unpaired t test, respectively. DEPs with similar quantitative changes were clustered by hierarchical clustering and analysed by gene ontology enrichment, revealing that 12 h and 60 h post-infection were the optimal times to analyse the autonomous parvovirus replication and apoptosis processes, respectively. Using the Metacore(TM) database, 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation. Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection.

During the peak time of COVID-19, as the long queues at health care facilities can result in spread of the virus. ICT can play an effective role especially for reducing the extended waiting time of patients to consult a medical practitioner which is considered as a source of hazard during the pandemic. However, in developing countries where majority population is semiliterate so find difficulty when come into contact with appointment systems which are not particularly designed keeping in consideration the requirements of semiliterate users. It is extremely important to better understand how to design user interface which allow semiliterate users to effectively perform the tasks. So there is a dire need to develop a simple, effective, easy to learn user interface (UI) of an online appointment system for the productive doctor-patient consultation. Therefore, this study aimed to providing an effective user interface of web based online appointment system to semi-literate users through User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology. To achieve this, a prototype was designed to overcome issues in the existing appointment systems gathered through a field study. The needs and expectation for semiliterate users were fulfilled by incorporating the requirements of UI development for the target users. A sample of forty-two semiliterate users was used to evaluate the prototype. The evaluation results showed that semiliterate users performance measured using effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction significantly improved while interacting with the prototype as compared to existing interfaces. The effectiveness is measured through number of errors and tasks accomplished in UI, efficiency by the time required to complete the task and satisfaction by System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS score improved from 50.8 to 77.6 for the prototype. ? 2021, Tech Science Press.

To understand the complex relationship between aerosol and lightning, two different regions with different climatic and weather conditions, a humid region R1 (22C29 N, 89C92 E) and an arid region R2 (23C28 N, 70C76 E) of northern India, were chosen for the study domain. The results show that lightning activity was observed to occur more over the humid region R1, i.e., 1141 days (1/3 of total days), than over the arid region R2, i.e., 740 days (1/5 of total days). Also, over the humid region R1, the highest lightning flash density was recorded as nearly 4.6  10(C4) flashes/km(2)/day observed for 18 days (1.5%); on the contrary, over the arid region R2, the maximum lightning flash density was observed to be 2.5  10(C4) flashes/km(2)/day and occurred for about 22 days (2.9%). The analysis shows that a nonlinear relationship exists between aerosol and lightning with a highly associated influence of relative humidity. A very significant positive and negative co-relation that varies with relative humidity has been observed between AOD and lightning for both humid and arid regions. This shows relative humidity is the key factor in determining the increase or decrease of lightning activity. This study also shows that the larger the cloud droplet size, the higher the relative humidity and vice versa. This study emphasizes that aerosol concentration in the atmosphere influences cloud microphysics by modulating the size of cloud droplets and thereby regulating the lightning frequency. The atmospheric humidity is the driving factor in deciding the positive or negative co-relationship between aerosol and lightning.

However, not much evidence is available regarding the experience of a tele-psychiatry consultation for both the care-providing clinician as well as the recipient. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the experience and satisfaction of the clinician and the patients/their caregiver during a telepsychiatry consultation. METHODS: Clinicians scored their experience of providing the consultation to patients over a call(video/audio) in a detailed Google form based questionnaire on a 6 point Likert scale, ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. Patients sociodemographic details were collected in a standard manner. Patients were sent a modified version of the Google form questionnaire on their registered mobile number to report their degree of satisfaction, after the call ended. RESULTS: 371 consecutive teleconsultations between April to June 2021 were assessed by 3 clinicians, of which 132 patients/caregivers responded back. The patients had a mean age of 43.5 years, were mostly male, married, educated beyond matric, employed and belonged to urban nuclear families. The average distance of their location from the hospital was 178 km and more than 80% of the patients were accompanied by their relatives in the teleconsultation. 53.6% of the consultations did not face any technological problems, while 24% had connectivity issues from the patient side. Overall, ~66.8% clinicians and 62% of the patients reported being satisfied to a large extent. 66% of the clinicians felt teleconsultation experience was same as an in-person consultation.

Prevalence data on 24-hour movement behaviours is lacking, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper describes the development of the SUNRISE International Study of Movement Behaviours in the Early Years protocol, designed to address this gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SUNRISE is the first international cross-sectional study that aims to determine the proportion of 3- and 4-year-old children who meet the WHO Global guidelines. The study will assess if proportions differ by gender, urban/rural location and/or socioeconomic status. Executive function, motor skills and adiposity will be assessed and potential correlates of 24-hour movement behaviours examined. Pilot research from 24 countries (14 LMICs) informed the study design and protocol. Data are collected locally by research staff from partnering institutions who are trained throughout the research process. Piloting of all measures to determine protocol acceptability and feasibility was interrupted by COVID-19 but is nearing completion. At the time of publication 41 countries are participating in the SUNRISE study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SUNRISE protocol has received ethics approved from the University of Wollongong, Australia, and in each country by the applicable ethics committees. Approval is also sought from any relevant government departments or organisations. The results will inform global efforts to prevent childhood obesity and ensure young children reach their health and developmental potential. Findings on the correlates of movement behaviours can guide future interventions to improve the movement behaviours in culturally specific ways. Study findings will be disseminated via publications, conference presentations and may contribute to the development of local guidelines and public health interventions.","output":"Cross-sectional examination of 24-hour movement behaviours among 3- and 4-year-old children in urban and rural settings in low-income, middle-income and high-income countries: the SUNRISE study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Des virus, causes de vascularites Si la plupart des vascularites systmiques sont de cause inconnue, la responsabilit dune infection virale a t dmontre de fa?on formelle pour certaines dentre elles, un traitement spcifique pouvant les gurir dfinitivement.

Summary Viruses, the cause of vasculitis Although the majority of systemic vasculitis are of unknown causes, the responsibility of a viral infection has been formally demonstrated in some of them and specific treatment can permanently cure them. Each virus incriminated accounts for a particular type of vasculitis. Hepatitis B viral infection (HBV) is the cause of polyarteritis nodosa in 36 to 50% of cases. The onset of the symptomatology is acute, usually within a few months following the infection; it is comparable to that observed in the absence of HBV infection. Cryoglobulinemia related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) The clinical manifestations are those of systemic vasculitis with particular tropism for the skin (involvement generally inaugural and almost constant), peripheral nerves and the glomerula. They occur fairly late during the infection. Vasculitis associated with HIV infection There is strong tropism for the peripheral (multi-neuritis) and central nervous system. During acute parvovirus B19 infection Vasculitis lesions have occasionally been reported following the viremic phase, generally limited to one or several flares of vascular purpura predominating on the lower limbs. Following varicella-herpes zoster infection Vasculitis occasionally develops in the form of a central neurological deficiency (locomotor deficiency with or without aphasia around one month after an ophthalmologic herpes zoster) or involving the retina or, more rarely, the skin or the kidneys. Vasculitis associated with cytomegaloviral infection Predominantly observed in immunodepressed patients, vasculitis after CMV infection is diffuse and basically involving the digestive tube, notably the colon, the central nervous system and the skin. A rare complication of an HTLV1 infection Vasculitis of the retina often in the form of necrotic retinitis is often associated with spasmodic paraparessia. Therapeutic strategy For many vasculitis of viral origin, corticosteroid and immunosuppressive treatments are only indicated in second intention following failure with antiviral agents and the combination of antivirals and plasma exchanges.","output":"Vascularites associes aux infections virales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Fisetin,quercetin and kaempferol are among the important representatives of flavonols, biological active phytocomounds, with low water solubility.

The disease burden has been heterogeneous across regions of the world, with Americas leading in cumulative cases and deaths, followed by Europe, Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa and Western Pacific. Initial responses to COVID-19 also varied between governments, ranging from proactive containment to delayed intervention. Understanding these variabilities allow high burden countries to learn from low burden countries on ways to create more sustainable response plans in the future. METHODS: This study used a mixed-methods approach to perform cross-country comparisons of pandemic responses in the United States (US), Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Italy and China. These countries were selected based on their income level, relative COVID-19 burden and geographic location. To rationalize the epidemiological variability, a list of 14 indicators was established to assess the countries preparedness, actual response, and socioeconomic and demographic profile in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: As of 1 April 2021, the US had the highest cases per million out of the nine countries, followed by Brazil, Italy, Germany, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and China. Meanwhile, Italy ranked first out of the nine countries total deaths per million, followed by the US, Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, China and Thailand. The epidemiological differences between these countries could be explained by nine indicators, and they were 1) leadership, governance and coordination of response, 2) communication, 3) community engagement, 4) multisectoral actions, 5) public health capacity, 6) universal health coverage, 7) medical services and hospital capacity, 8) demography and 9) burden of non-communicable diseases.

Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence.

Evidence-based guidelines on thromboprophylaxis strategies in patients with CS are currently lacking. We aimed to map the current clinical practice for thromboprophylaxis management in patients with CS across reference centers (RCs) of the European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN), which are endorsed specifically for the diagnosis and treatment of CS. Using the EU survey tool, a primary screening survey, and subsequently a secondary, more in-depth survey were developed. RESULTS: The majority of the RCs provided thromboprophylaxis to patients with CS (n = 23/25), although only one center had a standardized thromboprophylaxis protocol (n = 1/23). RCs most frequently started thromboprophylaxis from CS diagnosis onwards (n = 11/23), and the majority stopped thromboprophylaxis based on individual patient characteristics, rather than standardized treatment duration (n = 15/23). Factors influencing the initiation of thromboprophylaxis were medical history of VTE (n = 15/23) and severity of hypercortisolism (n = 15/23). Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparin was selected as the first-choice anticoagulant drug for thromboprophylaxis by all RCs (n = 23/23). Postoperatively, the majority of RCs reported severe immobilization as an indication to start thromboprophylaxis in patients with CS (n = 15/25). Most RCs (n = 19/25) did not provide standardized testing for variables of hemostasis in the postoperative care of CS. Furthermore, the majority of the RCs provided preoperative medical treatment to patients with CS (n = 23/25). About half of these RCs (n = 12/23) took a previous VTE into account when starting preoperative medical treatment, and about two-thirds (n = 15/23) included reduction of VTE risk as a goal of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is a large practice variation regarding thromboprophylaxis management and perioperative medical treatment in patients with CS, even in Endo-ERN RCs. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the optimal prophylactic anticoagulant regimen, carefully balancing the increased risk of (perioperative) bleeding, and the presence of additional risk factors for thrombosis.

Pollution is varied, ranging from human-made plastics and pharmaceutical compounds, to human-altered abiotic factors, such as sediment and nutrient runoff. As global population, wealth and resource consumption continue to grow, so too does the amount of potential pollution produced. This presents us with a grand challenge which requires interdisciplinary knowledge to solve. There is sufficient data on the human health, social, economic, and environmental risks of marine pollution, resulting in increased awareness and motivation to address this global challenge, however a significant lag exists when implementing strategies to address this issue. This review draws upon the expertise of 17 experts from the fields of social sciences, marine science, visual arts, and Traditional and First Nations Knowledge Holders to present two futures; the Business-As-Usual, based on current trends and observations of growing marine pollution, and a More Sustainable Future, which imagines what our ocean could look like if we implemented current knowledge and technologies. We identify priority actions that governments, industry and consumers can implement at pollution sources, vectors and sinks, over the next decade to reduce marine pollution and steer us towards the More Sustainable Future.

Standard practises that have evolved to minimise the risks associated with tracheostomy must be comprehensively reviewed in light of the numerous potential episodes for aerosol generating procedures. We meet the urgent need for safe practise standards by presenting the experience of two major London teaching hospitals, and synthesise our findings into an evidence-based guideline for multidisciplinary care of the tracheostomy patient. METHODS: This is a narrative review presenting the extensive experience of over 120 patients with tracheostomy, with a pragmatic analysis of currently available evidence for safe tracheostomy care in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tracheostomy care involves many potentially aerosol generating procedures which may pose a risk of viral transmission to staff and patients. We make a series of recommendations to ameliorate this risk through infection control strategies, equipment modification, and individualised decannulation protocols. In addition, we discuss the multidisciplinary collaboration that is absolutely fundamental to safe and effective practise. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 requires a radical rethink of many tenets of tracheostomy care, and controversy continues to exist regarding the optimal techniques to minimise risk to patients and healthcare workers. Safe practise requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach to infection control, weaning and decannulation, with integrated processes for continuous prospective data collection and audit.","output":"Tracheostomy care and decannulation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to summarize and critically appraise systematic reviews of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans that were available at the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHOs Global Research, LILACS, and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019, to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory, and radiological findings), and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). A meta-analysis was performed of the prevalence of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty (did not identify any relevant study). Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of all 18 reviews was rated as critically low. Identified symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82C95%), cough with or without sputum (58C72%), dyspnea (26C59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29C51%), sore throat (10C13%), headache (8C12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5C9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. A frequent finding on chest imaging was uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. A single review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3 to 13.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this overview of systematic reviews, we analyzed evidence from the first 18 systematic reviews that were published after the emergence of COVID-19. However, confidence in the results of all reviews was critically low. Thus, systematic reviews that were published early on in the pandemic were of questionable usefulness. Even during public health emergencies, studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodological standards.

Methods: Retrospective analysis from January 2013 to April 2021 of all ECMO cases for ARDS at a German University Hospital. In patients with IFD (IFD patients), type of IFD, time of IFD, choice of antifungal agent, duration, and success of therapy were investigated. For comparison, patients without IFD (non-IFD patients) were selected by propensity score matching using treatment-independent variables (age, gender, height, weight, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at ICU admission). Demographics, hospital and ICU length of stay, duration of ECMO therapy, days on mechanical ventilation, prognostic scores (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS), and length of survival were assessed. Results: A total of 646 patients received ECMO, 368 patients received VV ECMO. The incidence of IFD on VV ECMO was 5.98%, with 5.43% for Candida bloodstream infections (CBSI) and 0.54% for invasive aspergillosis (IA).

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in eight European countries (Albania, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia) including 18+ year olds with the goal to reach as many people as possible and generate robust data. We used various sampling approaches (convenience sampling, snowball sampling, panel data) utilizing social media, professional organisations, educational institutions and personal direct contact. To gather robust data, focus was on multiperspectivity rather than representativeness. A mix of sampling approach is possible. Digital sampling methods were feasible in the European region. RESULTS: In total 2,426 participants filled out >50% of the questionnaire in the overall sample, which is, also due to the rapidness of survey development, a good result for data on mental health and resilience during COVID-19 pandemic.

We included primary studies involving Chinese HWs during the pandemic, and data were extracted from the published articles. Our primary outcome was prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders. We pooled prevalence value with their 95% confidence interval using random effect models and assessed study quality on the basis of an 11-item checklist recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020195843). Results: We identified 25 articles comprising a total of 30,841 completed questionnaires and 22 studies for meta-analysis.

METHODS We performed a prospective, single-academic center study comparing CCE2 with OC in patients with LSTs diagnosed using OC, which was performed during the 3-month period prior to CCE2. We focused on the sensitivity and specificity of CCE2 for detecting LSTs. LSTs were classified into the LST-granular type (LST-G) or the LST-non-granular type (LST-NG). RESULTS Thirty patients (mean age 59.5 years) were enrolled. Of them, 21 LSTs (7 LST-Gs and 14 LST-NGs) were evaluated in this study. The mean diameter of the LSTs was 27  15 mm (range 10-60 mm). Histopathological diagnoses of the LSTs were as follows: tubular adenoma, 12 cases (57%); sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P), 4 cases (19%); Tis carcinoma, 1 case (5%); and T1 carcinoma, 4 cases (19 LSTs were found in the following locations: cecum, 1 case (5%); ascending colon, 6 cases (29%); transverse colon, 6 cases, (29%); descending colon, 1 case (5%); sigmoid colon, 3 cases (13%); and rectum, 4 cases (19%).

DesignQualitative cross-sectional survey. SettingNew Zealand community cohort. Participants1040 respondents entered the study (18-90 years, M = 48.18.11, SD = 15.52, 76% women). 966 completed the questions relevant to this article. Participants were recruited via online advertisement campaigns designed to maximise variation in the sample as far as practicably possible. Main outcome measuresThematic analysis of participants narratives. ResultsA majority of participants reported that the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 had allowed their life to go back to being more or less the same as before the pandemic. A small number indicated the pandemic had inspired them to become more social following elimination. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority of respondents reported being less social, even many months after SARS-CoV-2 had been eliminated. This was often because of fears that the virus might be circulating undetected, or because the March-May 2020 lockdown had led to changes in relationships and personal habits that were not easily reversed. Becoming less social was associated with having an underlying health condition that heightened ones vulnerability to COVID-19 (p = 0.00005) and older age (p = 0.007).

However, such outcomes are not inevitable. Re-establishing social connections after elimination can sometimes be a challenging process, with which people may need support.

We report the case of a 10-year-old boy patient who had pure elbow dislocation following falling onto an outstretched hand in a wrestling match. Because the physical examination findings of the patient indicated the presence of hyperlaxity, the patient was treated by closed reduction, short-term immobilization, and early strengthening of the dynamic stabilizers.

For promoting the optimization of infection prevention measures by identifying acts and situations with high risk of infection, we conducted a survey and analysis to understand the detailed process of infection spread in these cases. METHODS: A structured interview was conducted for the special training participants on their health status, changes in symptoms, training methods, and behavior history in their private lives. Additionally, a patrol of the training facility was carried out to understand the training environment, and antibody tests were conducted on the close contacts for more accurately grasping the spread of infection, by identifying subclinical infected persons. RESULTS: Within 10 days of COVID-19 onset in the first patient, 15 of the 19 original training participants developed symptoms, and 14 patients tested positive for RT-PCR. PCR tests were also performed on four patients who did not develop the disease - two were positive and negative, each. The two negatives turned positive on a later antibody test, suggesting that there was an asymptomatic infection. In addition, all five patients who participated in the training for only a day developed symptoms and tested positive for PCR in a few days. Of the 64 people who underwent testing for antibodies as close contacts, all but one who was living together with a patient were negative on antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 occurred after the start of practice-based training continuously; therefore, the practice-based training was thought to be the main cause of the transmission. We speculate that the main factors behind the rapid spread of infection are as follows: during practice-based training, increased ventilation made it difficult to wear a mask; repeated loud vocalizations at close range; and the training pair was not fixed. Physical training without shouting and desk work, however, did not possess the risk of COVID-19, and avoiding certain situations at high risk of respiratory infections may have significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If personnel become infected with SARS-CoV-2, emergency measures should be devised by identifying patients and close contacts and facilitating the investigation of their behavioral history. Furthermore, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of infection control measures is necessary by ascertaining potentially infected persons by performing PCR tests, antigen tests, antibody tests, etc. in combination.","output":"[Survey of the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the job training members with high exercise intensity: Analysis of the factors causing infection spread and the effectiveness of the prevention measures]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dire need for safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines is met with many vaccine candidates being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is evolving differently in Africa compared to other regions, with lower transmission and milder clinical presentation. Reasons for this are not fully understood. Recent data from Eastern and Southern Africa suggest that transmission may be higher than measured. Detailed epidemiological data in different African settings is urgently needed. Methods. We calculated cumulative rates of SAR-CoV-2 infections per 1,000 people at risk in The Gambia (2.42 million individuals) using publicly available data. We evaluated these rates in a cohort of 1,366 employees working at the MRC Unit The Gambia @LSHTM (MRCG) where systematic surveillance of symptomatic cases and contact tracing was implemented. Cumulative rates among the Gambian population were stratified by age groups and, among MRCG staff, by occupational exposure risk. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal samples with consistent sampling and laboratory procedures across cohorts. Findings. By September 2020, 3,579 cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 115 deaths had been identified; with 67% of cases detected in August. Among them, 191 cases were MRCG staff; all of them were asymptomatic/mild, with no deaths. The cumulative incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection among MRCG staff (excluding those with occupational exposure risk) was 129 per 1,000, at least 20-fold higher than the estimations based on diagnosed cases in the adult Gambian population.

The EU has called this as an unprecedented displacement crisis and has aimed at devising a comprehensive approach to tackle it, which has been widely criticized. Concerns about public healthcare aspects of the crisis have permanently entered the media and policy discourse even though no systematic association between migration and the importation of infectious diseases has been recorded. In this context, the literature has not filled the existing gap between discourse and evidence, and almost no publications with reliable empirical data exist, both thematic (epidemiology) and geographical (Eastern Europe and Bulgaria). Among the existing publications, the focus has been on TB and HIV (Odone et al., Euro J Public Health 25(3):506C512, 2015). In light of this, the aim of this research is to contribute to the debate by providing an overview of the refugee situation in Bulgaria, as a primary entry-point for refugees entering the EU. In order to achieve this, the article analyses the case of the refugee camp in city of Harmanly, close to the Bulgarian-Turkish border, and assesses the public health risks related to this specific situation. Based on a study of 128 patients with different symptoms we aim to draw wider implications about the linkages between public health and migration. The in-depth review of this specific case shows that both the probability and impact of migration on public health increases when the hosting country is relatively poor, the domestic public healthcare system is not efficient, and there is lack of trust in the government and public services.

The objectives of this study were to compare the prognostic ability for severe NHAP of five prediction rules (PSI, CURB-65, M-ATS, R-ATS, Espa?a rule), and to evaluate their usefulness to identify patients with less severe disease in the emergency department for outpatient care. METHODS A prospective observational study of consecutive NHAP patients was conducted at a university teaching hospital emergency department in Hong Kong between January 2004 and June 2005. The primary outcome was severe pneumonia (defined as combined 30-day mortality and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission). RESULTS 767 consecutive NHAP patients were included. Mean (SD) age was 83.4 (9.0) years; 350 (45.6%) were male and 644 (84.0%) had coexisting illness. 95 patients died within 30 days (12.4%), five patients were admitted to the ICU (0.7%) and 98 patients had severe pneumonia (12.8%). Sensitivity and specificity of each decision rule ranged from 37.8% to 95.9% and 15.1% to 87.6% respectively. The overall predictive performance of each rule was between 0.627 and 0.712. The negative likelihood ratios of PSI (0.27) and CURB-65 (0.23) were lower than M-ATS (0.71), R-ATS (0.45) and Espa?a (0.39). After excluding 204 patients with either poor functional status or those >90 years of age, sensitivities of M-ATS (96.0%) and R-ATS (100%) improved greatly with negative likelihood ratios of <0.1.

Among the 2,461 data collected, 741 were hypertensive (30.1%) and 1720 were normal (69.9%). During the data gathering process, eleven anthropometric measurements and sociodemographic data were collected. The variable selection procedure in the methodology proposed selected five parameters: weight, weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), age, sex, and ethnicity, as the input of the network model. The developed MLP model with a single hidden layer of 50 hidden neurons managed to achieve a sensitivity of 0.41, specificity of 0.91, precision of 0.65, F-score of 0.50, accuracy of 0.76, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 0.75 using the imbalanced data set. Analyzing the performance metrics obtained from the training, validation and testing data sets show that the developed network model is well-generalized. Using Bayes' Theorem, an adolescent classified as hypertensive using this created model has a 66.2% likelihood of having hypertension in the Sarawak adolescent population, which has a hypertension prevalence of 30.1%. When the prevalence of hypertension in the Sarawak population was increased to 50%, the developed model could predict an adolescent having hypertension with an 82.0% chance, whereas when the prevalence of hypertension was reduced to 10%, the developed model could only predict true positive hypertension with a 33.6% chance. With the sensitivity of the model increasing to 65% and 90% while retaining a specificity of 91%, the true positivity of an adolescent being hypertension would be 75.7% and 81.2%, respectively, according to Bayes' Theorem. The findings show that simple anthropometric measurements paired with sociodemographic data are feasible to be used to classify hypertension in adolescents using the developed MLP model in Sarawak adolescent population with modest hypertension prevalence. However, a model with higher sensitivity and specificity is required for better positive hypertension predictive value when the prevalence is low. We conclude that the developed classification model could serve as a quick and easy preliminary warning tool for screening high-risk adolescents of developing hypertension.","output":"A Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Model to Classify Hypertension in Adolescents Using Anthropometric Measurements: A Cross-Sectional Study in Sarawak, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are different factors that are the cause of abrupt spread of arbovirus.

The impact of public health measures practised by children during COVID-19 is relatively unknown. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the association between physical and social distancing measures and childrens outdoor time, sleep duration, and screen time during COVID-19. DESIGN/METHODS: A longitudinal study using repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in healthy children (0 to 10 years) between April 14 and July 15, 2020. Parents were asked to complete questionnaires about isolation, physical distancing practices, and childrens health behaviours. The primary exposure was the average number of days that children practised physical and social distancing measures per week. The three outcomes were childrens outdoor time, total screen time, and sleep duration during COVID-19. Linear mixed effects models were fitted using repeated measures of primary exposure and outcomes. RESULTS: This study included 554 observations from 265 children. Physical and social distancing measures were associated with shorter outdoor time (-17.2; 95% CI -22.07, -12.40; p < 0.001) and longer total screen time (11.3; 95% CI 3.88, 18.79; p = 0.003) during COVID-19. The association with outdoor time was stronger in younger children (< 5 years), and the associations with total screen time were stronger in females and in older children ( 5 years).

We assessed the extent to which DSD coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) dispensing intervals have changed during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Zambia. METHODS: We used client data from Zambia's electronic medical record system (SmartCare) for 737 health facilities, representing about three\\\\fourths of all ART clients nationally. We compared the numbers and proportional distributions of clients enrolled in DSD models in the 6 months before and 6 months after the first case of COVID\\\\19 was diagnosed in Zambia in March 2020.

Emerging evidence revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to genomic instability. We sought to identify and validate a genomic instability-associated lncRNA prognostic signature to assess HNSCC patient survival outcomes. Methods: RNA-sequencing data, somatic mutation files, and patient clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A total of 491 patients with completely clinical files were randomly divided into training and testing sets. In the training set, genomic instability-associated lncRNAs were screened through univariate Cox regression analyses and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses to build a genomic instability-associated lncRNA signature (GILncSig). In addition, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and clinical stratification analyses were used to evaluate the signature's reliability. Finally, in situ hybridization experiments were performed to validate GILncSig expression levels between adjacent non-tumor tissues and tumor tissues from HNSCC patients. Results: Four genomic instability-associated lncRNAs (AC023310.4, AC091729.1, LINC01564, and MIR3142HG) were selected for the prognostic signature. The model was successfully validated using the testing cohort. ROC analysis demonstrated its strong predictive ability for HNSCC prognosis. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the GILncSig was an independent predictor of prognosis. HNSCC patients with a low-risk score showed a substantially better prognosis than the high-risk groups. The in situ hybridization experiments using human HNSCC tissue revealed high GILncSig expression in HNSCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Conclusion: We developed a novel GILncSig for prognosis prediction in HNSCC patients, and the components of that signature might be therapeutic targets for HNSCC.","output":"Identification and Validation of a Novel Genomic Instability-Associated Long Non-Coding RNA Prognostic Signature in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, causing major destructions to human life directly and indirectly to the economic crisis around the world.

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei. A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases. The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases.

Over 128 million people have been infected with it and 2.8 million deaths have already taken place, till 30th March 2021. The identification of materials positive cases is the first step towards its containment and treatment. However, testing of individuals is an extensive, expensive and time-consuming exercise. In addition, societal taboos are also associated with infected individuals resulting in very few people volunteering for testing, esp. in the developing and under-developed world. An alternative approach that circumvents individual testing is the wastewater-based epidemiology. A state-of-the-art review of this method is provided in context of its utility for COVID-19 detection. This technique relies on collecting and testing samples from sewers and/or wastewater treatment plants for the presence of pathogens and then using that data to determine and predict the spread of the infection, thereby allowing the provision of appropriate containment and treatment steps. The study covers key aspects of wastewater-based epidemiology application for COVID-19 detection including its need, detailed process of detection and assessment, data analysis, economics and challenges to its application. Findings from a number of case studies are presented to elucidate the utility of this technique. It is clearly seen that WBE-based approach is a much better strategy as compared to individual testing and can be adopted to prevent further spread of Covid-19. The work is expected to further emphasize the application of this method for COVID (and other pandemic) detection and implementing containment strategies.

We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. RESULTS: We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to -0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2. Anxiety decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.09/21 (95% CI: -0.24 to -0.07) and by 0.77/21 (95% CI: -0.93 to -0.61) to FU2. Stress decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.30/21 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.09) and by 1.32/21 (95% CI: -1.55 to -1.09) to FU2. Students with pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality or pre-pandemic mental health problems did not have worse trajectories of mean mental health symptoms.

Antiviral drugs are an indispensable weapon to treat infected people and reduce the impact on human health, nevertheless anti-Flu armamentarium still remains inadequate. In search for new anti-Flu drugs, our group has focused on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) developing disruptors of PA-PB1 subunits interface with the best compounds characterized by cycloheptathiophene-3-carboxamide and 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-2-carboxamide scaffolds. By merging these moieties, two very interesting hybrid compounds were recently identified, starting from which, in this paper, a series of analogues were designed and synthesized. In particular, a thorough exploration of the cycloheptathiophene-3-carboxamide moiety led to acquire important SAR insight and identify new active compounds showing both the ability to inhibit PA-PB1 interaction and viral replication in the micromolar range and at non-toxic concentrations. For few compounds, the ability to efficiently inhibit PA-PB1 subunits interaction did not translate into anti-Flu activity. Chemical/physical properties were investigated for a couple of compounds suggesting that the low solubility of compound 14, due to a strong crystal lattice, may have impaired its antiviral activity. Finally, computational studies performed on compound 23, in which the phenyl ring suitably replaced the cycloheptathiophene, suggested that, in addition to hydrophobic interactions, H-bonds enhanced its binding within the PA(C) cavity.","output":"Synthesis and Characterization of 1,2,4-Triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-2-carboxamide-based Compounds Targeting the PA-PB1 Interface of Influenza A Virus Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As advances occur in surgical technique, postoperative care, and immunosuppressive therapy, the rate of mortality in the early postoperative period following lung transplantation continues to decline.

We state the consolidated and systematic approach for academic medical centres in response to the evolving pandemic outbreaks for sustaining medical education.Discussion: Academic medical centres need to establish a 'COVID-19 response team' in order to make time-sensitive decisions while managing pandemic threats. Major themes of medical education management include leveraging on remote or decentralised modes of medical education delivery, maintaining the integrity of formative and summative assessments while restructuring patient-contact components, and developing action plans for maintenance of essential activities based on pandemic risk alert levels. These core principles must be applied seamlessly across the various fraternities of academic centres: undergraduate education, residency training, continuous professional development and research. Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.Conclusions: While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.","output":"Coordinated responses of academic medical centres to pandemics: Sustaining medical education during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the aftermath of the Second World War, the goal of contributing to conflict prevention and post-conflict reconciliation emerged as the main driver of city diplomacys expansion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have faced stressful situations that have negatively impacted their psychological health. In this study, we explored impacts of the emotional wellbeing of healthcare professionals on their intention to quit their jobs. A cross-sectional survey design was used for this study. The respondents were selected based on simple random sampling. In total, 345 questionaries were returned and used for the analysis. Respondents were healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, midwives, technicians, etc.) working in a pandemic hospital in Turkey. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict the emotions that encouraged the respondents to intend to quit their jobs. Emotions including anxiety, burnout, and depression were measured using validated scales. We found that the COVID-19 situation increased the turnover intention, especially among doctors and nurses (OR(nurse/midwife) = 22.28 (2.78C41.25), p = 0.01; OR(doctors) = 18.13 (2.22C2.27), p = 0.01) mediating the emotional pressure it was putting them under.

In this study, we compared the incidence curves of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in different countries and reported the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in our institute, as well as the kinetics and sources of the infections. We used mortality collected from a COVID-19 data repository for 221 countries. Viral variants were defined based on 5 hallmark mutations along the whole genome shared by 30 genomes. SARS-CoV-2 genotype was determined for 24,181 patients using next-generation genome and gene sequencing (in 47 and 11% of cases, respectively) or variant-specific qPCR (in 42% of cases). Sixteen variants were identified by analyzing viral genomes from 9,788 SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed patients. Our data show that since the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic episode in Marseille, importation through travel from abroad was documented for seven of the new variants. In addition, for the B.1.160 variant of Pangolin classification (a.k.a. Marseille-4), we suspect transmission from farm minks. In conclusion, we observed that the successive epidemic peaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not linked to rebounds of viral genotypes that are already present but to newly introduced variants. We thus suggest that border control is the best mean of combating this type of introduction, and that intensive control of mink farms is also necessary to prevent the emergence of new variants generated in this animal reservoir.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variants From 24,181 Patients Exemplifies the Role of Globalization and Zoonosis in Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether epidural steroid injections (ESI) are superior to epidural or non-epidural placebo injections in sciatica patients. METHODS The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification. RESULTS Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (- 8.6 [- 13.4; - 3.9]) and 3 months (- 5.2 [- 10.1; - 0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (- 4.1 [- 6.5; - 1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low. CONCLUSION The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies.

We used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 as a model to gain insight into how coronaviruses affect the type I alpha/beta interferon (IFN) system. We demonstrate that MHV is resistant to type I IFN. Protein kinase R (PKR) and the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor are not phosphorylated in infected cells. The RNase L activity associated with 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase is not activated or is blocked, since cellular RNA is not degraded. These results are consistent with lack of protein translation shutoff early following infection. We used a well-established recombinant vaccinia virus (VV)-based expression system that lacks the viral IFN antagonist E3L to screen viral genes for their ability to rescue the IFN sensitivity of the mutant.

While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt estimates to different data sources representing COVID-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths with confirmed COVID-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of the disease. We highlight that policy makers could better target interventions by considering the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.

However, the proper deployment of air filtration has been hampered by an insufficient understanding of its principles. These misconceptions have led to uncertainty about the effectiveness of air filtration at arresting potentially infectious aerosol particles. A correct understanding of how air filtration works is critical for further decision-making regarding its use in managing the spread of COVID-19. The issue is significant because recent evidence has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain airborne longer and travel farther than anticipated earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with diminishing concentrations and viability. While SARS-CoV-2 virions are around 60-140 nm in diameter, larger respiratory droplets and air pollution particles (>1 m) have been found to harbor the virions. Removing particles that could carry SARS-CoV-2 from the air is possible using air filtration, which relies on the natural or mechanical movement of air. Among various types of air filters, high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters have been recommended. Other types of filters are less or more effective and, correspondingly, are easier or harder to move air through. The use of masks, respirators, air filtration modules, and other dedicated equipment is an essential intervention in the management of COVID-19 spread. It is critical to consider the mechanisms of air filtration and to understand how aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 virions interact with filter materials to determine the best practices for the use of air filtration to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Air filtration and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence based interventions (EBIs) can improve patient care and outcomes. Understanding the process for successfully introducing and implementing EBIs can inform effective roll-out and scale up. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework can be used to evaluate and guide the introduction and implementation of EBIs. In this study, we used kangaroo mother care (KMC) as an example of an evidence-based neonatal intervention recently introduced in selected Chinese hospitals, to identify the factors that influenced its successful implementation. We also explored the utility of the PARIHS framework in China and investigated how important each of its constructs (evidence, context and facilitation) and sub-elements were perceived to be to successful implementation of EBIs in a Chinese setting. METHOD: We conducted clinical observations and semi-structured interviews with 10 physicians and 18 nurses in five tertiary hospitals implementing KMC. Interview questions were organized around issues including knowledge and beliefs, resources, culture, implementation readiness and climate. We used directed content analysis to analyze the interview transcript, amending the PARIHS framework to incorporate emerging sub-themes. We also rated the constructs and sub-elements on a continuum from low (weak), moderate or high (strong) highlighting the ones considered most influential for hospital level implementation by study participants. RESULTS: Using KMC as an example, our finding suggest that clinical experience, culture, leadership, evaluation, and facilitation are highly influential elements for EBI implementation in China. External evidence had a moderate impact, especially in the initial awareness raising stages of implementation and resources were also considered to be of moderate importance, although this may change as implementation progresses. Patient experience was not seen as a driver for implementation at hospital level. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings examining KMC implementation as a case example, the PARIHS framework can be a useful tool for planning and evaluating EBI implementation in China. However, its sub-elements should be assessed and adapted to the implementation setting.

Bacterial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), synthesised by endosymbionts living in specialised shipworm cells called bacteriocytes and located in the animal's gills, play an important role in wood digestion in shipworms. However, the main site of lignocellulose digestion within these wood-boring molluscs, which contains both endogenous lignocellulolytic enzymes and prokaryotic enzymes, is the caecum, and the mechanism by which bacterial enzymes reach the distant caecum lumen has remained so far mysterious. Here, we provide a characterisation of the path through which bacterial CAZymes produced in the gills of the shipworm Lyrodus pedicellatus reach the distant caecum to contribute to the digestion of wood. RESULTS Through a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, X-ray microtomography, electron microscopy studies and in vitro biochemical characterisation, we show that wood-digesting enzymes produced by symbiotic bacteria are localised not only in the gills, but also in the lumen of the food groove, a stream of mucus secreted by gill cells that carries food particles trapped by filter feeding to the mouth. Bacterial CAZymes are also present in the crystalline style and in the caecum of their shipworm host, suggesting a unique pathway by which enzymes involved in a symbiotic interaction are transported to their site of action. Finally, we characterise in vitro four new bacterial glycosyl hydrolases and a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase identified in our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses as some of the major bacterial enzymes involved in this unusual biological system. CONCLUSION Based on our data, we propose that bacteria and their enzymes are transported from the gills along the food groove to the shipworm's mouth and digestive tract, where they aid in wood digestion.","output":"Characterisation of the enzyme transport path between shipworms and their bacterial symbionts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi complex prior to exocytosis. The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which require residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E in a recombinant virus background results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (WT) IBV-infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with an increased Golgi luminal pH. Infection with IBV or expression of IBV E induces neutralization of Golgi pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cell factors, protecting IBV S from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus-induced alteration in the microenvironment of the secretory pathway. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. Understanding the role of the CoV E protein in virus assembly and release is thus an important prerequisite for potential vaccines as well as in identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.","output":"The Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH To Protect the Spike Protein and Promote the Release of Infectious Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Few data are available concerning the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the persistent symptoms associated with COVID-19, also called long-COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Patients and methods: We conducted a nationwide online survey among adult patients with PACS as defined by symptoms persisting over 4 weeks following a confirmed or probable COVID-19, without any identified alternative diagnosis. Information concerning PACS symptoms, vaccine type and scheme and its effect on PACS symptoms were studied. Results: Six hundred and twenty surveys were completed and 567 satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Respondents were 83.4% of women of median age 44 (IQR 25-75: 37-50). Initial infection was proven in 365 patients (64%) and 5.1% had been hospitalized to receive oxygen. 396 patients had received at least one injection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time of the survey, after a median of 357 [198-431] days following the initially-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 380 patients who reported persistent symptoms at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 201 (52.8%) reported variation of symptoms following the injection, without difference based on the type of vaccine used. After a complete vaccination scheme, 93.3% (28/30) of initially seronegative patients reported a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 170 PACS patients had not been vaccinated. The most common reasons for postponing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were a fear of worsening PACS symptoms (55.9%) and the idea that vaccination was contraindicated because of PACS (15.6%).

METHODS: This was a nested caseCcontrol study using data from an established cohort including 121 IAH cases identified from 1756 patients who were admitted to ICU in a tertiary care facility in Japan. We included patients who were admitted with a normal range of serum sodium concentrations (130C149 mEq/L) from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 and remained in ICU for  2 days. Hypernatremia was defined as serum sodium concentration  150 mEq/L. Each case was matched to one control. RESULTS: Multivariable conditional logistic regression revealed high-dose glucocorticoid {odds ratio (OR), 4.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29C13.4]}, acute kidney injury (AKI) [OR, 2.72 (95% CI 1.31C5.62)], and osmotic diuretics [OR, 3.44 (95% CI 1.41C8.39)] to be significantly associated with IAH.

The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-&#954;B signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling.

Due to the ongoing pecuniary disaster that ensued because of COVID-19, many immigrants are coming back to their ancestry from different migrant-friendly countries for several reasons. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to segregate these countries into five vulnerability labels based on probabilistic likelihood score (LHS) and unsupervised clustering algorithms (CA). A survey dataset of returnee people including various information has been collected and leveraged as attributes in this study. Depending on the dissemination of attributes, LHS has been generated using Bayes' Theorem for each vulnerable country and three unsupervised mining algorithms (KMeans++, Agglomerative and BIRCH) have been applied to the LHS for categorization. Output labels obtained from CA are then evaluated appropriating the average LHS. Multiple performance measurement metrics (Adjusted Rand Index, Mutual Information based Score) have been consolidated to get an incisive comparison of vulnerability labels resulting from CA and expected LHS. The highest value of 0.74 has been attained as Normalized Mutual Information based Score for BIRCH clustering accompanying ample results for the remaining algorithms.

Delays in access to elective surgery are not uniform in their impact on patients with different attributes. The objective of this study is to measure the change in patients cost utility due to delayed elective cholecystectomy. METHODS: This study is based on retrospective analysis of a longitudinal sample of participants who have had elective cholecystectomy and completed the EQ-5D(3L) measuring health status preoperatively and postoperatively. Emergent cases were excluded. Patients younger than 19 years of age, unable to communicate in English or residing in a long-term care facility were ineligible. Quality-adjusted life years attributable to cholecystectomy were calculated by comparing health state utility values between the pre- and postoperative time points. The loss in quality-adjusted life years due to delayed access was calculated under four assumed scenarios regarding the length of the delay. The mean cost per quality-adjusted life years are shown for the overall sample and by sex and age categories. RESULTS: Among the 646 eligible patients, 30.1% of participants (N = 195) completed their preoperative and postoperative EQ-5D(3L). A delay of 12 months resulted in a mean loss of 6.4%, or 0.117, of the quality-adjusted life years expected without the delay. Among patients older than 70 years of age, a 12-month delay in their surgery corresponded with a 25.1% increase in the cost per quality-adjusted life years, from $10 758 to $13 463. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to focus on minimizing loss of quality of life for patients affected by delayed surgeries. Faced with equal delayed access to elective surgery, triage may need to prioritize older patients to maximize their health over their remaining life years.","output":"Measuring the impact of delayed access to elective cholecystectomy through patients cost-utility: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during April/May COVID-19 'stay at home' restrictions. METHODS: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants (adults: n=1,188, 82% female, mean age=37.415.1 years; adolescents: n=963, 71% female, mean age=16.21.2 years) reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (non-users). RESULTS: Overall, 39% of adults and 26% of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (OR=2.0, 95%CI 1.5-2.7), muscle strengthening (OR=3.3, 95%CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR=2.7, 95%CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to non-users.

CONCLUSIONS: Digital platform users were more likely than non-users to meet moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines during the April/May COVID-19 'stay at home' restrictions.

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest.

This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the comprehensive delay behaviors and to evaluate its effect on outcomes in patients with breast cancer in Dalian, a northeast city of China. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted using a cancer registry dataset including 298 patients. The KaplanCMeier survival analysis was used to identify the threshold of total delay, dividing the patients into a group with significant uncertainty and a group without substantial delay. The factors associated with the significant total delay were investigated from the potential candidates, like income level and marital status, by using the chi-squared test. The difference of the clinicopathologic characteristics between the patients grouped by the significant total delay, like tumor size and lymph node metastasis, was also investigated to find out the effect of the total delay. RESULTS: A total of 238 charts were used for analysis. The mean age was 57.3. The median of total delays was 3.75 months. Thirty days was identified as a threshold, more than which the total delay can lead to worse survival. Patients marital status (p = 0.010), income levels (p = 0.003), smoking status (p = 0.031), initial visiting hospital level (p = 0.005), self-health care (p = 0.001), and self-concern about initial symptom (p  0.000) were identified as the independent predictors of the total delay. Metastasis (p  0.000) was identified as the significant result relating to the significant total delay. CONCLUSIONS: A total delay of more than 30 days predicts worse survival in breast cancer patients in Dalian.

Pre-existing health conditions and early morphological alterations may precipitate cardiac injury and dysfunction after contracting the virus. The current study aimed at assessing potential risk factors for COVID-19 cardiac complications in patients with pre-existing conditions and imaging predictors. Methods and Results: The multi-center, retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled 400 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in six Chinese hospitals remote to the Wuhan epicenter. Patients were diagnosed with or without the complication of myocardial injury by history and cardiac biomarker Troponin I/T (TnI/T) elevation above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. The majority of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury exhibited pre-existing health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease. They had increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and more in-hospital adverse events (admission to an intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Chest CT scan on admission demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had higher epicardial adipose tissue volume ([EATV] 139.1 (83.8C195.9) vs. 92.6 (76.2C134.4) cm(2); P = 0.036). The optimal EATV cut-off value (137.1 cm(2)) served as a useful factor for assessing myocardial injury, which yielded sensitivity and specificity of 55.0% (95%CI, 32.0C76.2%) and 77.4% (95%CI, 71.6C82.3%) in adverse cardiac events, respectively.

UPR resolves ER stress by activating a cascade of cellular responses, including the induction of molecular chaperones, translational attenuation, ER-associated degradation, and other mechanisms. Under prolonged and irremediable ER stress, however, the UPR can also trigger apoptosis. Here, we report that in cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), ER stress was induced and the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of UPR was activated. Knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrated that IRE1 protects infected cells from IBV-induced apoptosis, which required both its kinase and RNase activities. Our data also suggest that splicing of XBP1 mRNA by IRE1 appears to convert XBP1 from a proapoptotic XBP1u protein to a prosurvival XBP1s protein. Moreover, IRE1 antagonized IBV-induced apoptosis by modulating the phosphorylation status of the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the prosurvival RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt). Taken together, the data indicate that the ER stress sensor IRE1 is activated in IBV-infected cells and serves as a survival factor during coronavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Animal coronaviruses are important veterinary viruses, which could cross the species barrier, becoming severe human pathogens. Molecular characterization of the interactions between coronaviruses and host cells is pivotal to understanding the pathogenicity and species specificity of coronavirus infection. It has been well established that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is closely associated with coronavirus replication. Here, we report that inositol-requiring protein 1 alpha (IRE1), a key sensor of ER stress, is activated in cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Moreover, IRE1 is shown to protect the infected cells from apoptosis by modulating the unfolded-protein response (UPR) and two kinases related to cell survival. This study demonstrates that UPR activation constitutes a major aspect of coronavirus-host interactions. Manipulations of the coronavirus-induced UPR may provide novel therapeutic targets for the control of coronavirus infection and pathogenesis.","output":"The endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1 protects cells from apoptosis induced by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the isolation of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus in Vero and porcine cell cultures, and the influence of age on disease in experimental infection.

We thus profiled the serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and specific memory B- and T-cell responses in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods Altogether 119 samples from 88 convalescent donors who experienced mild to critical disease were tested for the presence of elevated anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibody levels over a period of eight months. In addition, level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, specific memory B- and T-cell responses were tested in a subset of samples. Findings Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 85% of the samples collected within 4 weeks after onset of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Levels of specific IgM/IgA antibodies declined after 1 month while levels of specific IgG antibodies and plasma neutralizing activities remained relatively stable up to 6 months after diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were still present, though at a significantly lower level, in 80% of the samples collected at 6-8 months after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B- and T-cell responses developed with time and were persistent in all patients followed up till 6-8 months. Conclusions Our data suggest that protective adaptive immunity following natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 might persist for at least 6-8 months, regardless of disease severity.

Finally, we characterized their interactions by gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. The results showed that their affinities were too low to form complexes, which suggest that pAPN may be controversial as the genuine receptor for PEDV.

Outbreak management was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was comparable with real-time TaqMan? PCR. METHODS: Designed, screened, selected and optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial dilutions (1.34  10(10?) 1.34  10(1) copies/L) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured Ebolavirus as established by real-time TaqMan? PCR that was performed using ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains C Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further tested for Dengue virus 1C4, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin strain). RESULTS: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per L of plasmid containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated from clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay could be suitable for implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating block and centrifuge is required for operation.

METHODS In this study, we compare DETECTR with qRT-PCR to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 on 378 patient samples. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared with qRT-PCR; however, this was not confirmed in this large patient cohort, where we report 95% reproducibility between the 2 tests.

DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of coronavirus disease 2019 literature on PubMed and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram.

In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, A?-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of A? toxicity.

Exosomes are nano-sized inert membrane vesicles derived from the endocytic pathway that play a critical role in intercellular communication. DC-derived exosomes (DCexos) additionally carried MHC class I/II (MHCI/II) often complexed with antigens and co-stimulatory molecules, thus capable of priming antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Indeed, vaccines with DCexos have been shown to exhibit better anti-tumor efficacy in eradicating tumors compared to DC vaccines in pre-clinical models. Coupled with their resistance to tumor immunosuppression, DCexo-based cancer vaccines have been heralded as the superior alternative cell-free therapeutic vaccines over DC vaccines, and have now been tested in multiple clinical trials. In this review, current studies of DCexo cancer vaccines as well as potential future directions will be discussed. ABSTRACT: As the initiators of adaptive immune responses, DCs play a central role in regulating the balance between CD8 T cell immunity versus tolerance to tumor antigens. Exploiting their function to potentiate host anti-tumor immunity, DC-based vaccines have been one of most promising and widely used cancer immunotherapies. However, DC-based cancer vaccines have not achieved the promised success in clinical trials, with one of the major obstacles being tumor-mediated immunosuppression. A recent discovery on the critical role of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) play in cross-priming tumor-specific CD8 T cells and determining the anti-tumor efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, however, has highlighted the need to further develop and refine DC-based vaccines either as monotherapies or in combination with other therapies. DC-derived exosomes (DCexos) have been heralded as a promising alternative to DC-based vaccines, as DCexos are more resistance to tumor-mediated suppression and DCexo vaccines have exhibited better anti-tumor efficacy in pre-clinical animal models. However, DCexo vaccines have only achieved limited clinical efficacy and failed to induce tumor-specific T cell responses in clinical trials. The lack of clinical efficacy might be partly due to the fact that all current clinical trials used peptide-loaded DCexos from monocyte-derived DCs. In this review, we will focus on the perspective of expanding current DCexo research to move DCexo cancer vaccines forward clinically to realize their potential in cancer immunotherapy.","output":"DC-Derived Exosomes for Cancer Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MERS-CoV spread in South Korea in 2015 was not only the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV in the region other than the Middle East but also a historic epidemic in South Korea.

RESULTS: In the survey, we engaged 6,350 persons, of whom 1,065 agreed to participate and after an eligibility logic check, 1,052 participated (16.6%). We accessed 412 internet posts as to PPE availability. Health workers satisfied with current preparedness to address COVID-19 were more likely to be female, to obtain knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from government organizations, and to consider their hospital prepared for the outbreak management. Health workers with more confidence in their abilities to respond were those with more faith in their institutions response capacities. Elements of readiness included having airborne infection isolation room, visitor control procedures, training in precautions and PPE use. Both survey and web post assessments suggested that health workers in need were unable to reliably obtain PPE. CONCLUSION: Health workers self-confidence depends on perceived institutional readiness.

We hypothesise that the most stringent social distancing (SD) measures (100% of level in Australia in April 2020) deliver better public health and economy outcomes. Design: Fit-for-purpose (individual-based and compartment) models were used to simulate the effects of different SD and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. Public reported COVID-19 data were used to estimate model parameters. Main outcome measures: Public health and economy outcomes for multiple social distancing levels were evaluated, assessing hard versus soft lockdowns, and for early versus later relaxation of social distancing. Outcomes included costs and the timing and magnitude of observed COVID-19 cases and cumulative deaths in Australia from March to June 2020. Results: Higher levels of social distancing achieve zero community transmission with 100% probability and lower economy cost while low levels of social distancing result in uncontrolled outbreaks and higher economy costs. High social distancing total economy costs were $17.4B versus $41.2B for 0.7 social distancing. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs. Conclusion(s): Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.","output":"Health and economic effects of COVID-19 control in Australia: Modelling and quantifying the payoffs of hard versus soft lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Negative effects of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) on depression have been reported, but the relative contribution of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) to such effects remains unclear. Our objective was to precisely quantify the effects modified or mediated by PA and SB using the recently developed four-way effect decomposition. METHODS: Our analysis included 22,117 adults (aged&#8805;20 years) participating in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moderate recreational activity (MRA), moderate work activity (MWA), and walk or bicycle for transportation, were measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A four-way decomposition was applied with PA and SB as mediator to decompose the total effects of CVDs on depression into four components: controlled direct effect (CDE), pure indirect effect (PIE), reference interaction (INTref), and mediated interaction effect (INTmed). RESULTS: There were statistically significant associations between CVDs, MRA, and depression, with the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of being 1.73 (1.42~2.30), 1.81 (1.42~2.30), respectively. With MRA as a mediator, there were interaction and mediation effects in the associations between CVDs and depression, and the proportions attributable of INTref, INTmed, and PIE were 94.08% (P<0.001), 3.92% (P = 0.007), and 1.68% (P = 0.006), respectively. Furthermore, the mediation effect was statistically significant in females rather than males. CONCLUSIONS: MRA strongly modified and mediated the effects of CVDs on depression, especially in females. Our results suggested that sufficient MRA (at least 150 min per week) was considered as requirement for preventing depression in CVDs patients in females.","output":"The effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the associations between cardiovascular diseases and depression: A four-way decomposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe disease that affects people of all ages. It can occur as an idiopathic disorder at birth or as part of a variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (IPV) can reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and improve RV function with minimal systemic effects. IPV includes inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled aerosolized prostacyclin, or analogs, including epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil, and other vasodilators. In addition to pulmonary vasodilating effects, IPV can also be used to improve oxygenation, reduce inflammation, and protect cell. Off-label use of IPV is common in daily clinical practice. However, evidence supporting the inhalational administration of these medications is limited, inconclusive, and controversial regarding their safety and efficacy. We conducted a search for relevant papers published up to May 2020 in four databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science. This review demonstrates that the clinical using and updated evidence of IPV. iNO is widely used in neonates, pediatrics, and adults with different cardiopulmonary diseases. The limitations of iNO include high cost, flat dose-response, risk of significant rebound PH after withdrawal, and the requirement of complex technology for monitoring. The literature suggests that inhaled aerosolized epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil and others such as milrinone and levosimendan may be similar to iNO.

Vaccination, initially targeting the elderly and vulnerable before later expanding to the entire adult population, has been transformative in the control of SARS-CoV-2 in England. However, early concerns over adverse events and the lower risk associated with infection in younger individuals means that the expansion of the vaccine programme to those under 18 years of age needs to be rigorously and quantitatively assessed. METHODS: Here, using a bespoke mathematical model matched to case and hospital data for England, we consider the potential impact of vaccinating 12C17 and 5C11-year-olds. This analysis is reported from an early model (generated in June 2021) that formed part of the evidence base for the decisions in England, and a later model (from November 2021) that benefits from a richer understanding of vaccine efficacy, greater knowledge of the Delta variant wave and uses data on the rate of vaccine administration. For both models, we consider the population wide impact of childhood vaccination as well as the specific impact on the age groups targeted for vaccination. RESULTS: Projections from June suggested that an expansion of the vaccine programme to those 12C17 years old could generate substantial reductions in infection, hospital admission and deaths in the entire population, depending on population behaviour following the relaxation of control measures. The benefits within the 12C17-year-old cohort were less marked, saving between 660 and 1100 (95% PI (prediction interval) 280C2300) hospital admissions and between 22 and 38 (95% PI 9C91) deaths depending on assumed population behaviour. For the more recent model, the benefits within this age group are reduced, saving on average 630 (95% PI 300C1300) hospital admissions and 11 (95% PI 5C28) deaths for 80% vaccine uptake, while the benefits to the wider population represent a reduction of 8C10% in hospital admissions and deaths. The vaccination of 5C11-year-olds is projected to have a far smaller impact, in part due to the later roll-out of vaccines to this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of 12C170-year-olds and 5C11-year-olds is projected to generate a reduction in infection, hospital admission and deaths for both the age groups involved and the population in general. For any decision involving childhood vaccination, these benefits needs to be balanced against potential adverse events from the vaccine, the operational constraints on delivery and the potential for diverting resources from other public health campaigns.

Different brief assessment instruments have been developed as efficacy measures of geriatric anxiety in order to overcome psychometric weaknesses of its long form. Among these, the 10-item Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS-10) showed strong psychometric properties in community-dwelling samples. However, its diagnostic accuracy is still unexplored, as well as its discriminative power in clinical samples. METHODS: In the present study, we explored the psychometric performance of the GAS-10 in the elderly through Item Response Theory in a sample of 1200 Italian community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly adults (53.8% males, mean age = 65.21  9.19 years). Concurrent validity, as well as diagnostic accuracy, was examined in a non-clinical sample (N = 229; 46.72% males) and clinical sample composed of 35 elderly outpatients (74.28% females) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). RESULTS: The GAS-10 displayed good internal construct validity, with unidimensional structure and no local dependency, good accuracy, and no signs of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) or measurement bias due to gender, but negligible due to the age. Differences in concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy among the long form version of the GAS and the GAS-10 were not found significant. The GAS-10 may be more useful than the longer versions in many clinical and research applications, when time constraints or fatigue are issues. CONCLUSION: Using the ROC curve, the GAS-10 showed good discriminant validity in categorizing outpatients with GAD disorder, and high anxiety symptoms as measured by the GAS-SF cut-off. The stable cut-off point provided could enhance the clinical usefulness of the GAS-10, which seems to be a promising valid and reliable tool for maximize diagnostic accuracy of geriatric anxiety symptoms.","output":"Psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy of the short form of the geriatric anxiety scale (GAS-10)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Coronavirus disease-2019 impacted the governments and public health systems worldwide, with the psychological impact including an increase in the level of stress, anxiety and depression We determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), and to determine the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic amongst medical students in Sarawak, Malaysia using the revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) Methods: We analysed 355 medical students data obtained from an online survey All the undergraduate medical students were the sample population IBM SPSS version 22 0 was used for data analysis A p-value of  05 was considered statistically significant Results: Analysis indicated that three-fourths of the students had no mental health issues More than one-tenth of the students were moderately depressed (12 4%) and 4 3% severely depressed A similar pattern of prevalence of anxiety was noted with 10% reported moderate anxiety, and 6 8% had severe anxiety 15 8% of the students had mild stress, 4 2% moderately stressed, and 2% severely stressed A hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis showed that hyperarousal appeared to be a predictor of depression (= 466, p&lt; 001), anxiety (= 481, p&lt; 001) and stress = 508, p&lt; 001) Along with hyperarousal, intrusion (= 148, p&lt; 05) predicts stress among the students Conclusion: Our analysis revealed that hyperarousal symptoms related to the global pandemic of COVID-19 led to significant mental health issues among students Therefore, urgent strategies to support the students psychosocial wellbeing and self-care and to strengthen their coping skills and resilience need to be implemented ? 2021 UPM Press All rights reserved","output":"Psychological impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health among medical students in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has brought serious challenges for the medical field.

Clinical data about acute kidney injury (AKI) during SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. We aimed to investigate the proportion, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in critical patients affected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A case/control study was conducted in two intensive care units of a tertiary teaching hospital. RESULTS: Among 109 patients, 75 were male (69%) with median age at 64 years and 48 (44%) developed AKI within 4 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1C9). Of them, 11 (23%), 9 (19%), and 28 (58%) were classified as stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. AKI patients were older and presented more sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis; higher initial urea and creatinine; more marked inflammatory syndrome and hematological disorders; and required more mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. An elevated D-dimers level (odds ratio [OR], 12.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9C85) was an independent factor of AKI. Sepsis was near to significance (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 0.94C28; P=0.058). AKI was independently related to mortality (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.49C105) and significantly reduced the survival (14.7 days; IQR, 12-17 vs. 19.9 days; IQR, 17-22.7; P=0.011) in AKI and no AKI group respectively. Hypoxemia with the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and the inspiratory concentration of oxygen <70, and vasopressors were identified as mortality factors.

Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germanys National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy) or within residential areas, and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases for public mobility in retail and recreational areas or workplaces, awareness measured by searches for corona in Google, higher rainfall, and some socio-demographic factors.

Emerging adults with pre-existing mood or anxiety disorders were of concern for worsening symptoms. We sought to demonstrate a method for monitoring mental health status of a group of patients with reduced access to their usual mental health services during quarantine. METHODS: A total of 326 patients enrolled in the First-Episode Mood and Anxiety Program in London, Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in online questionnaires regularly. Patients were flagged for high level of risk based on depression scores, suicidal ideation and worsening in anxiety, depression or quality of health. All patients were also asked if they wanted contact with a clinician. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen (35%) patients completed at least one questionnaire. Thirty were flagged based on scores; 37 (32.5%) participating patients requested help. Participants who were flagged for concerning scores were younger, more likely to be on the wait list for treatment, to have been laid off from work and have more functional impairment. Participants requesting support had higher symptom scores for depression and lower scores on quality of health. CONCLUSIONS: The process utilized here identified patients at risk and in need of clinical support in the context of pandemic quarantine. It provided an accessible avenue for invited patients to communicate both symptom status and need for contact. Such a process can provide valuable monitoring during times when the usual communications between patients and health care providers is compromised and clinician time is limited.

The first objective is to examine the mediating roles of spatial presence and co-presence in the relationship between technology enabled co-creation and service experience. The second objective is to investigate if healthcare service experience impacts patients' relationship value with hospitals and subsequent patronage intention. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 516 customers of three leading hospitals in India during the social isolation period of COVID-19. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings The study results demonstrate that customers' favourably perceived technology-enabled co-creation generates feelings of spatial presence and co-presence in the technology-enabled platform. The feeling of presence enhances patients' health care service experiences which in turn predict their relationship value perceptions towards the healthcare service provider. Co-presence dominates as a mediator in terms of magnitude over spatial presence. The favourable value perception positively impacts patients' intention to come back to the same hospital. Research limitations/implications The study uses cross-sectional data, which does not incorporate any temporal variations in the investigated relationships. The study does not account for differences in government vs. private undertakings of healthcare system. Practical implications The findings envisage a digital healthcare retail system, where hospitals can enhance patients' perceptions of healthcare service experience, relational value and re-patronage intention, based on the digital mediated environment design elements, i.e. spatial presence and co-presence. As co-presence is a dominant factor, ensuring that human healthcare experts (rather than technology based e-service elements like chatbots) participate in healthcare service co-creation is of prime importance to provide enriching service experience to the patients. Originality/value The value of the research lies in extending the theories of presence, UTAUT and S-O-R to understand digital healthcare retailing, in order to identify the mechanism of how online co-creative platform can generate hospital patronage behaviour among patients through the serial mediation of presence, augmented service experience and relationship value.","output":"Digital healthcare retail: role of presence in creating patients' experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, there is increasing evidence of neuronal injury by the means of elevated serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels. However, the role of systemic inflammation and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)Cspecific immune response with regard to neuronal injury has not yet been investigated. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, we recruited patients with mildCmoderate (n = 39) and severe (n = 14) COVID-19 and measured sNfL levels, cytokine concentrations, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies including neutralizing antibody titers, and cell-mediated immune responses at enrollment and at 28(7) days. We explored the association of neuro-axonal injury as by the means of sNfL measurements with disease severity, cytokine levels, and virus-specific immune responses. Results: sNfL levels, as an indicator for neuronal injury, were higher at enrollment and increased during follow-up in severely ill patients, whereas during mildCmoderate COVID-19, sNfL levels remained unchanged. Severe COVID-19 was associated with increased concentrations of cytokines assessed [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-)], higher anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG concentrations, and increased neutralizing antibody titers compared with mildCmoderate disease. Patients with more severe disease had higher counts of defined SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Increases in sNfL concentrations from baseline to day 28(7) positively correlated with anti-spike protein IgG antibody levels and with titers of neutralizing antibodies. Conclusion: Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased serum concentration of cytokines and subsequent neuronal injury as reflected by increased levels of sNfL. Patients with more severe disease developed higher neutralizing antibody titers and higher counts of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells during the course of COVID-19 disease. Mounting a pronounced virus-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect from neuro-axonal damage as by the means of sNfL levels.","output":"Neuro-axonal injury in COVID-19: the role of systemic inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic hit all over the world and cancer patients are more vulnerable for COVID-19. Mortality rate may increase up to 25% in solid malignancies. In parallel to increased mortality rates among cancer patients, safety concerns regarding cancer treatment has increased over time. However, there were contradictory results for the cancer treatment during pandemic. In this study, we assessed the effect of cancer treatment on the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched on September 01, 2020. Primary endpoints were severe disease and death in the cancer patients treated within the last 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. Quality of included studies were assessed by New Castle-Ottawa Scale. Generic inverse variance method was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included for this meta-analysis. Chemotherapy within the last thirty days before COVID-19 diagnosis increased the risk of death in cancer patients after adjusting for confounding variables (OR: 1.85; 95% CI:1.26-2.71). However, severe COVID-19 risk did not increase. Furthermore, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy did not increase the severe disease and death risk in cancer patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy increased the risk of death from COVID-19 in cancer patients.

Proper disinfection of surfaces after cleaning, an important consideration at all times, has assumed special significance during the current pandemic. The global shortage of disposable equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE), specifically N95 masks and surgical 3 ply masks, and other items makes the HCWs vulnerable to transmission of infection while caring for these patients. Therefore, resterilization of such items has assumed equal importance. Cleaning, the first step in the process of sterilization, is of vital importance to reduce bioburden. The type of disinfection required depends on the nature of the equipment and its intended use. For example, critical items need high-level decontamination. In this narrative review, we elaborate on the methods of decontamination and sterilization. Many chemicals can be used for both sterilization and disinfection, and the difference lies in the concentration of the chemical and exposure time. We have also summarized strategies which can be used for resterilization of single-use items, in view of the shortages caused by the current pandemic.

Herein, we report the comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion using trypsin and trypsin/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6 most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit.

There is a need to investigate the impact on anesthesia and intensive care doctors (ICU), especially after the rise of vaccination. Anesthesia and ICU doctors are among the frontline HCW dealing with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Their job puts them at risk of developing psychological disorders because of the daily stress. The aim of the current study was to assess factors affecting anxiety and depression among vaccinated anesthesia and ICU doctors working in United Arab Emirates (UAE). A cross-sectional study targeting vaccinated anesthesia and ICU doctors in UAE was conducted during March 2021. Data were collected using an online questionnaire uploaded to Google Forms including two sections; the first section included question assessing personal data, professional background data, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and type of vaccine received. The second section of the questionnaire included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of different factors with anxiety and depression. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Significantly higher anxiety (46%) and depression (53.6%) were associated with the PfizerCBioNTech vaccine. The lowest anxiety (23.9%) and depression (21.6%) scores were related to the Sinopharm vaccine. Anxiety was significantly higher for participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR = 2.55), and depression was lower for those who deal with COVID-19-positive patients (AOR = 0.28). Anesthesiologists had significantly lower anxiety and depression than those specialized in both anesthesia and ICU (AOR = 0.32 and 0.51) CONCLUSIONS: Previous diagnosis with COVID-19, female gender, and medical comorbidities were associated with high rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression among anesthesia and ICU doctors.

Multiple utility metrics have been proposed and used to evaluate synthetic data. However, they have not been validated in general or for comparing SDG methods. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the ability of common utility metrics to rank SDG methods according to performance on a specific analytic workload. The workload of interest is the use of synthetic data for logistic regression prediction models, which is a very frequent workload in health research. METHODS: We evaluated 6 utility metrics on 30 different health data sets and 3 different SDG methods (a Bayesian network, a Generative Adversarial Network, and sequential tree synthesis). These metrics were computed by averaging across 20 synthetic data sets from the same generative model. The metrics were then tested on their ability to rank the SDG methods based on prediction performance. Prediction performance was defined as the difference between each of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve values on synthetic data logistic regression prediction models versus real data models. RESULTS: The utility metric best able to rank SDG methods was the multivariate Hellinger distance based on a Gaussian copula representation of real and synthetic joint distributions. CONCLUSIONS: This study has validated a generative model utility metric, the multivariate Hellinger distance, which can be used to reliably rank competing SDG methods on the same data set.

This study also examines the opportunity cost of cigarette expenditure to children's nutritional adequacy. METHODS We used an Indonesian cross-sectional household level nationwide data of 2018 National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS). Using multivariate Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression, we estimated the impact of cigarette consumption on household's NA as defined by household protein and energy intakes. With the same specification, we further ran a segregated OLS regression by household quintile expenditure. While the opportunity cost of cigarette consumption to children's nutrition adequacy defined the estimated forgone nutrition due to cigarette consumption by following the Ministry of Health (MOH) definition of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for children aged 4 - 6. RESULTS Cigarette consumption decreases household's protein and energy intakes. We found statistically significant correlation between household's cigarette consumption and household's per capita protein intake while no statistically significant correlation on energy intake. Furthermore, the segregated estimate is significant for both protein and energy intakes among 60% lowest household quintile expenditure groups. The lower the quintile expenditure, the higher the decline in household NA due to cigarette consumption. With the average cigarette expenditure of IDR12,956 per household per day, giving up daily cigarette spending could meet children's energy intake by 27% - 85,4% of RDA and protein intake by 180.12% - 300.48% of RDA.

The chapter aims to provide a detailed methodology of LBDD and the current research endeavors that have utilized the technique to identify, screen, or design potential drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Ligand-Based Approaches for the Development of Drugs Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple studies regarding the use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) in patients with non-compressible torso injuries and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock were recently published. To date, the clinical evidence of the efficacy of REBOA is still debated. We aimed to conduct a systematic review assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of REBOA in patients with major trauma and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and CENTRAL up to June 2020. All randomized controlled trials and observational studies that investigated the use of REBOA compared to resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) with/without REBOA or no-REBOA were eligible. We followed the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Two authors independently extracted data and appraised the risk of bias of included studies. Effect sizes were pooled in a meta-analysis using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Primary outcomes were mortality, volume of infused blood components, health-related quality of life, time to haemorrhage control and any adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were improvement in haemodynamic status and failure/success of REBOA technique. RESULTS: We included 11 studies (5866 participants) ranging from fair to good quality. REBOA was associated with lower mortality when compared to RT (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20C0.74), whereas no difference was observed when REBOA was compared to no-REBOA (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 0.79C2.46). No significant difference in health-related quality of life between REBOA and RT (p = 0.766). The most commonly reported complications were amputation, haematoma and pseudoaneurysm. Sparse data and heterogeneity of reporting for all other outcomes prevented any estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on overall mortality suggest a positive effect of REBOA among non-compressible torso injuries when compared to RT but no differences compared to no-REBOA. Variability in indications and patient characteristics prevents any conclusion deserving further investigation. REBOA should be promoted in specific training programs in an experimental setting in order to test its effectiveness and a randomized trial should be planned.

Diminishing of the virulence of bacteria is a promising approach to decrease the development of bacterial resistance. Quorum sensing (QS) systems orchestrate the bacterial virulence in inducerCreceptors manner. Bacteria can spy on the cells of the host by sensing adrenergic hormones and other neurotransmitters, and in turn, these neurotransmitters can induce bacterial pathogenesis. In this direction, -adrenergic blockers were proposed as an anti-virulence agents through inhibiting the bacterial espionage. The current study aimed to explore the -blockers anti-QS activities. Within comprehensive in silico investigation, the binding affinities of seven -adrenoreceptor blockers were evaluated towards structurally different QS receptors. From the best docked -blockers into QS receptors, terazosin was nominated to be subjected for further in vivo and in vitro anti-QS and anti-virulence activities against Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Terazosin showed a significant ability to diminish the QS-controlled pigment production in C. violaceum. Moreover, Terazosin decreased the P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and down-regulated its QS-encoding genes. Terazosin protected mice from the P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.

Based on our analysis, we develop the following five propositions to advance our understanding of emotions' role in customer experience research. First, we argue that positive and negative emotions can coexist during the consumption experience. Second, positive emotions do not automatically lead to positive consumption outcomes, and negative emotions may not necessarily generate negative results. Third, positive or negative emotions toward a company employee might not automatically transfer to the company as a whole. Fourth, customers are not apathetic victims of their emotions with no capability to control their emotional experiences. Our last proposition is that consumption emotions are not a purely intrapersonal phenomenon, but that the social context matters and influences the consumption experience.

The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers, required students to follow the entire arc of the empirical research cycle twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of experimental research and the scientific method. The flipped classroom approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or elsewhere without the supervision of an instructor. Despite the COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful research projects. While there were of course difficulties encountered in the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design of the course were vital to the resilience of the course: the choice for fully open-inquiry projects, the decision to use Arduinos as measurement tools, and the flipped aspect of the instruction methods.

The resultant foam was immersed in ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP). PU, NL-PU, and PU-NL/EEP foams were characterized from mechanical, morphological, and chemical perspectives. NL Incorporation into PU increased mechanical strength, while EEP coating showed lower strength than PU-NL/EEP. Morphological investigations confirmed an open-celled structure with a pore diameter of 150C200 m, a density of nearly 0.2 g/cm(3,), and porosity greater than 85%, which led to significantly high water absorption (267% for PU-NL/EEP). The hydrophilic nature of foams, measured by the contact angle, proved to be increased by NL addition and EEP coating. PU and PU-NL did not show important antibacterial features, while EEP coating resulted in a significant antibacterial efficiency. All foams revealed high biocompatibility toward L929 fibroblasts, with the highest cell viability and cell attachment for PU-NL/EEP. In vivo wound healing using Wistar rats full-thickness skin wound model confirmed that PU-NL/EEP exhibited an essentially higher wound healing efficacy compared with other foams.

We found eyebrow wave detection performance was worse for synchronous movements of the eyebrows and mouth. Subsequently, we found this effect was specific to stimuli presented to the right visual field, implicating the involvement of left lateralised visual speech areas. Adaptation has been used as a tool in low-level vision to establish the presence of separable visual channels. Adaptation to moving eyebrows and mouths with various relative timings reduced eyebrow wave detection but only when the adapting mouth and eyebrows moved asynchronously. Inverting the face led to a greater reduction in detection after adaptation particularly for asynchronous facial motion at test.

AD neurons exhibit a reduced ability to form autophagosomes and degrade proteins via autophagy. Using genetically manipulated colon cancer cells we determined whether drugs that directly inhibit the chaperone ATPase activity or cause chaperone degradation and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling leading to macroautophagy could reduce the levels of these proteins. The antiviral chaperone ATPase inhibitor AR12 reduced the ATPase activities and total expression of GRP78, HSP90, and HSP70, and of Tau, Tau 301L, APP, APP692, APP715, SOD1 G93A and TDP-43. In parallel, it increased the phosphorylation of ATG13 S318 and eIF2A S51 and caused eIF2A-dependent autophagosome formation and autophagic flux. Knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 prevented chaperone, APP and Tau degradation. Neratinib, used to treat HER2+ breast cancer, reduced chaperone levels and expression of Tau and APP via macroautophagy, and neratinib interacted with AR12 to cause further reductions in protein levels. The autophagy-regulatory protein ATG16L1 is expressed as two isoforms, T300 or A300: Africans trend to express T300 and Europeans A300. We observed higher basal expression of Tau in T300 cells when compared to isogenic A300 cells. ATG16L1 isoform expression did not alter basal levels of HSP90, HSP70 or HSP27, however, basal levels of GRP78 were reduced in A300 cells.

In the D-dimer blood concentrations to exclude LA thrombus in patients with AF study, two D-dimer cut-offs were compared to exclude LA thrombus prior to cardioversion. One was fixed to 500 ng/mL (DD500), based on clinical practice where such values are commonly accepted to exclude a thrombus. The other cut-off was adjusted to 10 times the patient's age (DDAge), based on the cut-off used to exclude pulmonary embolism. METHODS 142 consecutive patients with non-valvular AF aged 69.711.4 years (52% with paroxysmal AF) referred for precardioversion TOE to exclude LA thrombus were prospectively enrolled. D-dimers were measured at the time of TOE by an ELISA test. RESULTS LA thrombus was excluded with TOE in 129 (91%) and confirmed in 13 (9%) patients. D-dimers were significantly lower in patients without LA thrombus (729611 vs 23761081 ng/L; p<0.05). DDAge indicated absence of LA thrombus with higher specificity than DD500 (66.4% vs 50.4%; p<0.05). Both cut-offs were able to identify all 13 patients with LA thrombus (false negative 0%).

While several research groups have made strides in developing candidate vaccines and therapeutics against henipaviruses, such countermeasures have not been licensed for human use, and significant gaps in knowledge about the human immune response to these viruses exist. To address these gaps, we isolated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of an individual with prior occupation-related exposure to the equine HeV vaccine (Equivac? HeV). Competition-binding and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies identified at least six distinct antigenic sites on the HeV/NiV receptor binding protein (RBP) that are recognized by human mAbs. Antibodies recognizing multiple antigenic sites potently neutralized NiV and/or HeV isolates in vitro. The most potent class of cross-reactive antibodies achieved neutralization by blocking viral attachment to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. Antibodies from this class mimic receptor binding by inducing a receptor-bound conformation to the HeV-RBP protein tetramer, exposing an epitope that appears to lie hidden in the interface between protomers within the HeV-RBP tetramer. Antibodies that recognize this cryptic epitope potently neutralized HeV and NiV. Flow cytometric studies using cell-surface-displayed HeV-RBP protein showed that cross-reactive, neutralizing mAbs from each of these classes cooperate for binding. In a highly stringent hamster model of NiVB infection, antibodies from both classes reduced morbidity and mortality and achieved synergistic protection in combination and provided therapeutic benefit when combined into two bispecific platforms.

It is possible that NK cells, known to have great cytokine secreting potential are competent at the onset of the condition and that in some individuals, the viral load is able to exhaust them. Balance between tolerant (CD27- CD11b-), secretory (CD27+ CD11b-/ CD27+ CD11b+) and cytotoxic (CD27- CD11b+) NK cells involved in the inflammatory response and their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity are still not well established. Strategies that can restore function of NK cells against the virus are worth investigating. Here, we aimed to characterize NK cells frequency, functional subtypes and maturation in early phase of COVID-19 patients, by Multiparametric Flow Cytometry (MFC). Methods Peripheral blood from 15 COVID-19 patients in early stage of infection (day 1-14, confirmed by RT-PCR), categorized according comorbidities in: G1 (not oncologic; n = 6), G2 (oncologic; n = 3), G3 (hematologic neoplasms; n = 3) and G4 (without comorbidities; n = 3), and 10 healthy samples enrolled the study. Clinical and laboratorial data were collected from electronic medical records. Samples were stained with CD45, CD19, CD3, CD56, CD11b, CD27, acquired on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed with FlowJo V10 software. Results A lower frequency of lymphocytes was observed in the disease when compared to controls (P < 0.0001) and frequency of NK cells were similar in both groups (P = 0.6605). Although frequency of CD27- CD11b- NK cells was lower in the disease (P = 0.0109), there was a significantly higher frequency of CD27+ CD11b- NK cells in COVID-19 samples when compared to controls (P < 0.0001), featuring a mostly immature profile in the disease. On the other hand, no statistical significance was observed regarding the frequencies of CD27+ CD11b+ (P = 0.1370) and CD27- CD11b+ NK cells with a more mature profile (P = 0.3094). Amongst disease groups, no statistical significance was found regarding frequency of NK cells and G1 showed lower frequency of CD27- CD11b- NK cells (P = 0.0226), while G3 group had an increased frequency of CD27+ CD11b- NK cells (P = 0.0238) when compared to the other groups and controls. Finally, no statistical significance was found in the frequency of CD27+ CD11b+ (P = 0.6691) and CD27- CD11b+ (P = 0.6270) NK cells between disease groups and controls. Conclusion Although the frequency of NK cells did not show a significant difference between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, our findings showed a possible change in their maturation profile, which seems to be inversely proportional to normal, with the frequency of CD27+ CD11b- NK cells considerably higher in the disease. This phenotype is directly associated with secretory function of a more immature NK cell and is responsible for triggering inflammatory responses that could lead to severe respiratory failure, what seems to be consistent with COVID-19 profile. A high frequency of cytotoxic cells was observed, which seemed to be similar to what we found in normal heathy samples. Even though unregulated maturation might be associated to a dysfunctional mature NK cell, additional studies of cytotoxicity and activation of NK cells in COVID-19 are required to affirm whether there is functional exhaustion or hyperactivation of the cytotoxic subtypes of these cells.","output":"ANTIVIRAL RESPONSE OF NATURAL KILLER CELLS IN EARLY STAGE OF COVID-19 PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to detect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with persistent positive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which viable virus can be inferred due to the presence of subgenomic (SG) viral RNA, which is expressed only in replicating viruses RNA remnants purified from diagnostic nasopharyngeal specimens were used as the templates for RT-PCR-specific detection of SG E gene RNA As controls, we also detected viral genomic RNA for the E gene and/or a human housekeeping gene (RNase P) We assessed the samples of 60 RT-PCR-positive cases with prolonged viral SARS-CoV-2 shedding (24 to 101 days) since the first diagnostic RT-PCR SG viral RNA was detected in 12/60 (20%) of the persistent cases, 28 to 79 days after the onset of symptoms The age range of the cases with prolonged viral shedding and the presence of SG RNA was quite wide (40 to 100 years), and the cases were equally distributed between males (42%) and females (58%) No case was HIV positive, although seven were immunosuppressed According to the severities of the COVID-19 episodes, they were mild (40%), intermediate (20%), and severe (40%) In a percentage of persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases, the presence of actively replicating virus may be inferred, far beyond diagnosis We should not assume a universal lack of infectiousness for COVID-19 cases with prolonged viral shedding","output":"Inference of Active Viral Replication in Cases with Sustained Positive Reverse Transcription-PCR Results for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Poverty and health illiteracy, combined with inappropriate systems to track disease and infection rates, contribute to children-and-mothers poor adherence to nutrient-rich foods intake in Bangladesh. Although risk factors for child and pregnant women malnutrition have been explored, the relationship between Bangladeshi adults nutrition literacy and their demographics and personal beliefs remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between adults nutrition literacy, demographics and personal beliefs in a large sample of Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: Four hundred adults from two districts (Dhaka and Chattogram) of Bangladesh participated in a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected by interviews using a structured questionnaire containing the Nutrition Literacy Scale. Multiple linear regression models were employed to analyze associations between nutrition literacy and related factors. RESULTS: The mean nutrition literacy score was 21.6 (SD: 3.7; range: 11C32) on a scale of 32. Multiple linear regression revealed that being a businessman ( = 1.66, p = 0.013) or private employee ( = 1.08, p = 0.030), having a higher family income ( = 1.17, p = 0.009), and a higher educational level were positively associated with higher nutrition literacy scores compared to their counterparts. Participants who had ever completed a nutrition-related course ( = 4.95, p < 0.001), and who perceived themselves as having a need for accessing nutrition-related information were positively associated with the higher nutrition literacy compared to their counterparts.

However, due to its high resolution and large number of channels, how to process and interpret the image data from IMC remains a key challenge to its further applications. Accurate and reliable single cell segmentation is the first and a critical step to process IMC image data.

The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on job organization, exploring the effects of lockdown measures on the psychological distress and perceived well-being of workers experiencing telework. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey has been used to collect data. The participants answered the questionnaire from April 1 to April 30, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, which investigated: 1) demographic and occupational variables, 2) lifestyle and habits variables, 3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been used to evaluate psychological distress and the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to explore subjective well-being. RESULTS: Psychological distress was associated with educational level, with habits, and with reporting poor well-being. Poor well-being was associated with a higher job demand during pandemic, lifestyle and habits variables, and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the perceived well-being and psychological distress of workers experiencing telework.

Here we describe our experience using the social virtual reality (VR) platform Mozilla Hubs for the pre-interview social during the 2020-2021 radiology residency virtual recruitment season, provide results of a survey sent to assess applicants attitudes towards the VR pre-interview social, and outline additional use-cases for the emerging technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VR Meeting Hall dedicated to the pre-interview social was designed in Mozilla Hubs. To assess applicants impressions of the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, applicants were sent an optional web-based survey. Survey respondents were asked to respond to a series of eleven statements using a five-point Likert scale of perceived agreement: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Statements were designed to gauge applicants attitudes towards the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social and its usefulness in helping them learn about the residency program, particularly in comparison with pre-interview socials held on conventional video conferencing software (CVCS). RESULTS: Of the 120 residency applicants invited to the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, 111 (93%) attended. Of these, 68 (61%) participated in the anonymous survey. Most applicants reported a better overall experience with Mozilla Hubs compared to CVCS (47/68, 69%), with 10% (7/68) reporting a worse overall experience, and 21% (14/68) neutral. Most applicants reported the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social allowed them to better assess residency culture than did pre-interview socials using CVCS (41/68, 60%). Seventy-two percent of applicants reported that the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social positively impacted their decision to strongly consider the residency program (49/68). CONCLUSION: Radiology residency applicants overall preferred a pre-interview social hosted on a social VR platform, Mozilla Hubs, compared to those hosted on CVCS.

The efficacy of these responses directly depends on the social behaviors of the target society. People react to these actions with respect to the information they received from different channels, such as news and social networks. Thus, analyzing news demonstrates a brief view of the information users received during the outbreak. METHODS: The raw data used in this study is collected from official news channels of news wires and agencies in Telegram messenger, which exceeds 2,400,000 posts. The posts that are quoted by NCRCs members are collected, cleaned, and divided into sentences. The topic modeling and tracking are utilized in a two-stage framework, which is customized for this problem to separate miscellaneous sentences from those presenting concerns. The first stage is fed with embedding vectors of sentences where they are grouped by the Mapper algorithm. Sentences belonging to singleton nodes are labeled as miscellaneous sentences. The remained sentences are vectorized, adopting Tf-IDF weighting schema in the second stage and topically modeled by the LDA method. Finally, relevant topics are aligned to the list of policies and actions, named topic themes, that are set up by the NCRC. RESULTS: Our results show that major concerns presented in about half of the sentences are (1) PCR lab. test, diagnosis, and screening, (2) Closure of the education system, and (3) awareness actions about washing hands and facial mask usage. Among the eight themes, intra-provincial travel and traffic restrictions, as well as briefing the national and provincial status, are under-presented. The timeline of concerns annotated by the preventive actions illustrates the changes in concerns addressed by NCRC. This timeline shows that although the announcements and public responses are not lagged behind the events, but cannot be considered as timely. Furthermore, the fluctuating series of concerns reveal that the NCRC has not a long-time response map, and members react to the closest announced policy/act. CONCLUSION: The results of our study can be used as a quantitative indicator for evaluating the availability of an on-time public response of Irans NCRC during the first three months of the outbreak. Moreover, it can be used in comparative studies to investigate the differences between awareness acts in various countries. Results of our customized-design framework showed that about one-third of the discussions of the NCRCs members cover miscellaneous topics that must be removed from the data.","output":"Track Iran's National COVID-19 Response Committees Major Concerns using Two-stage Unsupervised Topic Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces B-cell responses that continue to evolve for at least one year.

Here, we examine memory B cell evolution 5 months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccines in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge 5 months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with breadth equivalent to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.","output":"Antibody Evolution after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Postoperative infection is a potentially devastating complication after THA and TKA. In the early postoperative period, clinicians often find nonspecific indicators of infection. Although leukocytosis may be a sign of a developing infection in the early postoperative period, it may also be part of a normal surgical response. QUESTIONS AND PURPOSES: We determined (1) the natural history of white blood cell values after primary THA and TKA, (2) factors associated with early postoperative leukocytosis, and (3) the predictive value of white blood cell count for early postoperative periprosthetic joint infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using our institutional database, we identified all THA and TKA cases between January 2000 and December 2008. We determined the incidence of leukocytosis and characterized the natural history of postoperative white blood cell counts. We then investigated potential indicators of postoperative leukocytosis, including development of early periprosthetic infection. RESULTS The average postoperative white blood cell count increased to approximately 3  10(6) cells/L over the first 2 postoperative days and then declined to a level slightly higher than the preoperative level by Postoperative Day 4. The incidence of postoperative leukocytosis for all patients was 38%. Factors associated with postoperative leukocytosis included TKA, bilateral procedures, older age, and higher modified Charlson Comorbidity Index. The sensitivity and specificity of white blood cell count for diagnosing early periprosthetic infection were 79% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative leukocytosis is common after THA and TKA and represents a normal physiologic response to surgery.

These hypotheses are tested using the cultural practice scores from GLOBE studies after controlling for certain covariates identified in literature. Multiple regression results reveal that societal culture significantly explains Covid-19 outcomes beyond the explanation due to control variables.

The outcomes included psychological distress, mothers fear of their children contracting COVID-19, change in childrens behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown and pregnant womens concerns. Multivariable ordinary least squares regression models were employed to examine the adjusted associations between sociodemographic factors and psychological distress, as well as fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 628 women, 11.8% (n = 74) were pregnant at the time of survey. Most of the pregnant women (89.2%, n = 66) had some degree of concerns about their unborn babies getting infected during delivery in the hospital.

Within the context of the one-shot collective risk dilemma, where enough members of a group must cooperate in order to avoid a collective disaster, we study the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in a hybrid population made of both adaptive and fixed-behavior agents. Specifically, we show how the first learn to adapt their behavior to compensate for the behavior of the latter. The less the (artificially) fixed agents cooperate, the more the adaptive population is motivated to cooperate, and vice-versa, especially when the risk is higher. By pinpointing how adaptive agents avoid their share of costly cooperation if the fixed-behavior agents implement a cooperative policy, our work hints towards an unbalanced hybrid world. On one hand, this means that introducing cooperative AI agents within our society might unburden human efforts.

Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive value beyond the HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of human development and vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. The metrics of economic inequality, perceived corruption, poverty, and inputs into the health system have strong bivariate correlations with COVID-19 vaccination but no longer remain statistically significant when controlling for the HDI.

The mobilization and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals, scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and inequity.","output":"Vaccination, life expectancy, and trust: Patterns of COVID-19 vaccination rates around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious disease pandemics are associated with social consequences and stigma that are noticeably similar in various health conditions, health systems, and cultures Stigma impacts health-related outcomes, not only as a barrier to receiving the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment but also as an important variable that increases mental health issues such as anxiety and depression The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with stigma too Studying similarities as well as differences in the features of stigma observed in each outbreak can provide us with the knowledge and deeper understanding of the situation, which is necessary for approaching the issue comprehensively The stigma needs to be addressed rigorously by professionals and health care providers as well as authorities Here, we narratively review stigma due to some well-known infectious diseases and how it parallels to the current COVID-19 situation After discussing its effects on both individuals and societies, we provide solutions to manage this important issue","output":"A Narrative Review of Stigma Related to Infectious Disease Outbreaks: What Can Be Learned in the Face of the Covid-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Acute patellar tendon rupture is easy to diagnose but is still often overlooked. The aim of this study was to assess early and late results of surgical treatment of acute patellar tendon rupture. Our hypothesis was that functional outcome is satisfactory. METHODS A retrospective study included 38 knees in 37 patients (4 female, 33 male). Mean age was 42.6  9.9 years (range, 23-81 years). Lesions comprised 15 tendon body ruptures, 20 avulsions from the tip of the patella and 3 avulsions from the anterior tibial tuberosity. Tendon repair was protected in more than 95% of cases by a reinforcement frame: hamstring (21 cases), synthetic ligament (12 cases) or metallic wire (3 cases). Results were evaluated in 2 steps: on patient files at a mean follow-up of 7.1 months (range, 3-24 months) to assess complications and early functional and radiological results; and by phone at a mean follow-up of 9.3 years (range, 19-229 months) in order to assess long-term functional outcome on Lysholm score and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Thirty-one knees were assessed at a mean 7.1 months. Mean knee flexion was 128.5  7.5 (range, 85-150), extension -1 (range, -15 to 0) and Caton-Deschamps index 0.96 (range, 0.57-1.29). Twenty-three knees were further assessed at a mean 9.3 years. Mean Lysholm score was 93.7 points (range, 61-100). Ninety-six percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the result. All had returned to their previous job, and 20 had returned to sports activities, including 8 at pretrauma level.

Its multi-systemic features include pulmonary, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), renal, and neurological manifestations. Its incidence is estimated to be 10.2 cases per million population. It is challenging to diagnose when its symptoms are treated in isolation from one another. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing GPA in a patient with respiratory symptoms during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and describes the challenges of managing it in the context of a subsequent COVID-19 infection as the mainstay of treatment remains immunosuppression. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old female non-smoker with a history of leg ulcers developed a 3-month history of cough and haemoptysis and was treated in primary care for suspected sinus and chest infections. She then presented to Accident and Emergency twice for the same symptoms and was discharged after having her antibiotics changed. 2 weeks later, she presented for the third time with cough, ongoing haemoptysis, conjunctivitis in the right eye, pain over the right side of her head, and discharge from her right ear. She was admitted as she was pyrexical, tachycardic and her CRP was 60. COVID-19 swabs were negative. ENT team recommended IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected orbital cellulitis. Blood cultures remained negative. CT sinuses with contrast showed right sided thrombosis of transverse sinus and bilateral mastoid effusion of the middle ear. Following neurology review, she was anticoagulated with dalteparin. A day later, she was transferred to the Respiratory ward and dropped her Haemoglobin level to 70. Her chest radiograph showed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and CT images showed widespread bilateral peri-hilar consolidation. A rheumatology opinion was sought and vasculitic screen showed ANCA 268, and PR3 >177. Her urinary protein/creatinine ratio was elevated at 90. Rheumatology team confirmed multi-systemic GPA and recommended starting oral Prednisolone 60 mg daily. After the renal team was consulted, she was moved to a side-room and started on IV Methylprednisolone (pulsed with three doses), along with cyclophosphamide and rituximab. Dalteparin was discontinued. 2 days later, she desaturated, and became pyrexical. Repeat COVID-19 swabs were positive. Three Consultants agreed that Plasma Exchange and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) would be inappropriate. A Do Not Attempt Resuscitation form was signed, and prognosis was discussed with the patient and her 78-year-old husband who requested to visit. Patient deteriorated and unfortunately died 6 days later. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This case is interesting because it highlights the diagnostic challenge of GPA. Retrospectively, it may be noted that doctors persisted in treating suspected infection although the patient continued to deteriorate. However, a diagnosis should be re-considered if the patient does not respond to treatment and it is important to consider vasculitis as a cause of haemoptysis. Anticoagulation was started since the benefits were considered to outweigh the risks as her haemoptysis was of small volume. The patient soon developed pulmonary haemorrhage, so the risks of anticoagulation should not be underestimated in vasculitis. The Rheumatology teams cautious approach to immunosuppression was in stark contrast to the renal teams aggressive approach. The Renal team believed that concerns about protecting the patient from COVID-19 when she was negative from this infection should not take precedence over appropriate immunosuppression from a potentially fatal vasculitis. The patient was admitted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and was negative for COVID-19 on admission. She was nursed in a bay on the Respiratory ward where she later became COVID-19 positive. This raises questions about whether the earlier test was a false negative result or whether her infection was hospital-acquired. Infection control guidelines were changing rapidly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to avoid plasma exchange was based on the findings of the PEXIVAS trial. NIV was avoided as it required a full-face mask to minimize particle dispersion but would pose an asphyxiation risk as patient was coughing up blood. Finally, the team learnt to be flexible in these extraordinary circumstances when dealing with the end-of-life decisions of the COVID-19 positive patient. Although her husband was a vulnerable person because of his age, he was given the opportunity to visit while wearing Personal Protective Equipment and agreed to self-isolate for two weeks. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: This case helped me appreciate the complexity of deciding to immunosuppress an already severely ill patient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. I recognised that the patient had a poor prognosis with or without immunosuppression and our role as healthcare professionals was to give her the best chance of recovery. The conference will allow me to interact with other colleagues and discuss what they would do in this situation as our Rheumatology and Renal teams had different approaches. After further reading on false negative results, we found that Johns Hopkins researchers found that testing people for SARS-CoV2 too early in the course of infection is likely to result in a false negative test even though they may eventually test positive for the virus. I have also learnt about the PEXIVAS trial which found that the addition of plasma exchange to standard therapy does not reduce the risk for all-cause mortality among patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. Moreover, a reduced-dose regimen of glucocorticoids is non-inferior to a standard-dose protocol, while reducing the risk for serious infections. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is not treatable with arterial embolization or bronchoscopic methods due to the diffuse nature of the bleeding. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to support patients with DAH but the use of ECMO is controversial due to the need for anticoagulation. The conference will help me deepen my understanding of epidemic rheumatology which will be useful for my clinical practice going forward, especially if there is a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am keen to use this event to engage with other clinicians on immunosuppression in the context of infection so that I may confidently manage similarly complex cases in the future.","output":"EP08 A case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis complicated by COVID-19: challenges in diagnosis and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest respiratory pandemic resulting from zoonotic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Severe symptoms include viral pneumonia secondary to infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, in some cases causing death We developed primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection Differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of proximal airway epithelium and 3D organoid cultures of alveolar epithelium were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response We validated the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirming that Remdesivir strongly suppressed viral infection/replication We provide a relevant platform for studying COVID-19 pathobiology and for rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent respiratory pathogens One Sentence Summary: A novel infection model of the adult human lung epithelium serves as a platform for COVID-19 studies and drug discovery","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human lung epithelium for COVID-19 modeling and drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the world is facing a global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19.

This survey represents an overview of the current policies regarding the surgical management of patients with GD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Web-based survey was conducted among 36 Hepato-Prancreato-Biliary surgeons from 14 Countries. Through a 17-item questionnaire, participants were asked about the local management of patients with GD since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The majority (n = 26,72.2%) of surgeons reported an alarming decrease in the cholecystectomy rate for GD since the start of the pandemic, regardless of the Country: 19(52.7%) didn't operate any GD, 7(19.4%) reduced their surgical activity by 50C75%, 10(27.8%) by 25C50%, 1(2.8%) maintained regular activity. Currently, only patients with GD complications are operated. Thirty-two (88.9%) participants expect these changes to last for at least 3 months. In 15(41.6%) Centers, patients are currently being screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection before cholecystectomy [in 10(27.8%) Centers only in the presence of suspected infection, in 5(13.9%) routinely]. The majority of surgeons (n = 29,80.6%) have adopted a laparoscopic approach as standard surgery, 5(13.9%) perform open cholecystectomy in patients with known/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2(5.6%) in all patients. CONCLUSION: In the ongoing COVID-19 emergency, the surgical treatment of GD is postponed, resulting in a huge number of untreated patients who could develop severe morbidity. Updated guidelines and dedicated pathways for patients with benign disease awaiting elective surgery are mandatory to prevent further aggravation of the overloaded healthcare systems.","output":"Global management of a common, underrated surgical task during the COVID-19 pandemic: Gallstone disease - An international survery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to explore the essence of the hydration process of chitin or chitosan in the presence of cation, the cooperativity effects between the H-bonding and Na+molecule interactions in the 1,4-dimethoxy-D-glucosamine (DMGA) complexes with H2O and Na+ were investigated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), M06-2X/6-311++G(2df,2p), and B97X-D/6-311++G(2df,2p) levels. The result shows that the complexes in which Na+ or H2O is bonded simultaneously to the -NH and -OH groups connected to the C3 atom of DMGA are the most stable. The cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects occur in DMGAH2ODMGA and DMGANa+H2O, while only the cooperativities are confirmed in DMGANa+DMGA. The cooperativity occurs in the DMGANa+H2O complexes without the hydration, while the anti-cooperativity occurs in those with the hydration. Furthermore, the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity in DMGANa+H2O are far stronger than those in DMGANa+DMGA or DMGAH2ODMGA. Therefore, a deduction is given that the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects play an important role in the hydration of chitin or chitosan in the presence of Na+. When only Na+ is linked with -OH and -NH groups of chitosan or chitin, due to the cooperativity effect, the hydration does not occur. When both Na+ and H2O are linked with -OH and -NH groups, the anti-cooperativities are dominant in controlling of the aggregation process of Na+, H2O, chitosan, and chitin, leading to the possible hydration. Atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis confirms the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects.

It is one of the larger NATO installations in Afghanistan, and with its location being one of the main hubs for international transit, the base has been at the frontline since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamid Karzai International Airport base commanders and medical staff have been at the forefront, continually developing policies and procedures to mitigate the pandemic in a deployed setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On base, approximately 4,000 people from 58 different nations lived within 0.5 km2. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made by the detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (BioFire or GeneXpert). Serological tests (detecting IgM and IgG antibodies) were used as a screening tool. Data were reported from April 1 to September 12, 2020. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and sixty-six PCR tests were run in the reported period. Four hundred and seventy-eight positive cases were identified. Of these, only 106 reported symptoms. Seventy-eight presented spontaneously to the emergency room, while the remaining positive cases were identified as a result of aggressive testing of close contacts, base screening and surge testing. Twenty-two patients required oxygen treatment. One patient required mechanical ventilation and later died after strategic evacuation. DISCUSSION: Mitigation of COVID-19 was achieved by measures to reduce the spread of the virus, measures to reduce the population, and a medical response plan. To manage the logistic burden of isolating and quarantining a large portion of the population, a multinational and multidisciplinary COVID Task Force was formed. CONCLUSIONS: In a military population of mostly young and healthy individuals, the majority of COVID-positive patients will have fewer symptoms, and therefore, the aggressive screening of asymptomatic personnel is necessary.

This brought a challenging situation in animal sciences courses that required laboratory sessions and hands-on experiences. There is not a real solution to replace the in-person labs, however several approaches can be implemented to overcome some of the challenges for laboratory sessions. Some of the on-line approaches implemented in an introductory class of Animal Sciences during the semester of spring and fall 2020 were live (synchronous) laboratory sessions (live interactions with animals, pre-recorded sessions of the laboratory session, and 360-degree videos of tours to the farms). The main objective of the present report is to assess the usefulness and feedback of these approaches to teach laboratory sessions to an undergraduate introductory animal science course. The official (Blue) university student responses in the course were used to determine the perception and feedback to these approaches. A total of 123 responses were recorded (Spring: 42/96, Fall: 81/174). Overall, no significant differences were observed in terms of the student perception. Overall, the responses were positive toward the laboratory sessions even in an online environment. During the spring semester 40/42 (95%), whereas in 72/81 (88%) strongly agree/mildly agree that labs help them to learn respectively. In terms of the videos used in class and labs, during the spring semester 35/41 (85%) and 68/81 (83%) strongly agree/mildly agree that labs help them to learn.

The enveloped viruses; such as SARS-CoV-2, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) and influenza, often hijack host-cell glycosylation pathways and influence pathobiology and immune selection. These glycan motifs can lead to either immune evasion or viral neutralization by the production of cross-reactive antibodies that can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Potential cross-protection from influenza vaccine has also been reported in COVID-19 infected individuals in several epidemiological studies recently; however, the scientific basis for these observations remains elusive. Herein, we show that the anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody cross-reacts with the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein.

Epitope mapping suggests that the cross-reactive antibodies are targeted towards glycan epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and HA. Overall, our findings address the cross-reactive responses, although non-neutralizing, elicited against RNA viruses and warrant further studies to investigate whether such non-neutralizing antibody responses can contribute to effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or ADE.","output":"Non-neutralizing SARS CoV-2 directed polyclonal antibodies demonstrate cross-reactivity with the HA glycans of influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To biomechanically evaluate various finger trap patterns and suture materials for securing 5F polyvinylchloride and polypropylene catheters. DESIGN In vitro prospective study. SAMPLE 132 finger trap constructs. PROCEDURES Each group of constructs comprised 6 to 10 replicates each of 3 finger trap patterns tied with 2-0 glycolide-lactide copolymer (GLC), braided nylon, and monofilament polypropylene suture on 5F polypropylene and polyvinylchloride catheters. The 3 finger trap variants were of similar lengths but differed in the number of surgeon's throws included in the pattern. Constructs were tested with a universal materials testing machine to the point of failure or a maximum of 100 mm of distraction. Force and distraction data were evaluated for significance with a competing risks model. RESULTS There was no difference in performance (as measured by the proportion of test failures, median distraction distance, or median force at failure or end of testing) attributable to the finger trap pattern variants. Sixteen of 66 constructs with polyvinylchloride catheter material failed at  100 mm distraction, whereas all polypropylene constructs failed during testing. For polypropylene catheters, braided nylon or GLC suture withstood greater distraction distance and force, respectively. For polyvinylchloride catheters, differences among suture types were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Data suggested that, for the material combinations evaluated, a finger trap suture pattern with fewer knots may provide catheter security similar to that for patterns tied with a more traditional pattern. These results should not be extrapolated to catheters of different diameters or materials, patterns tied with different suture sizes, or clinical performance in vivo without further testing.","output":"Biomechanical evaluation of finger trap suture variants for securing catheters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the inception of the group testing problem in World War II, one of the prevailing assumptions in the probabilistic variant of the problem has been that individuals in the population are infected by a disease independently. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases typically spread through interactions between individuals and therefore cause infections to be correlated. Inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and similar diseases, we consider an infection model over networks which generalizes the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this infection model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. We prove that when the network and infection parameters are conducive to 'strong community structure;' our proposed adaptive, graph-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm, and is even order-optimal in certain parameter regimes.

Effective testing supports identification of COVID-19 cases; facilitates isolation, quarantine, and timely treatment measures that limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19); and guides public health officials about the incidence of COVID-19 in a community. A White House Joint Task Force, co-led by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), created the Community-Based Testing Sites (CBTS) program working with state and local partners (2). This report describes the timeline, services delivered, and scope of the CBTS program. During March 19, 2020-April 11, 2021, the CBTS program conducted 11,661,923 SARS-CoV-2 tests at 8,319 locations across the United States and its territories, including 402,223 (3.5%) administered through Drive-Through Testing, 10,129,142 (86.9%) through Pharmacies+ Testing, and 1,130,558 (9.7%) through Surge Testing programs. Tests administered through the CBTS program yielded 1,176,959 (10.1%) positive results for SARS-CoV-2. Among tested persons with available race data,* positive test results were highest among American Indian or Alaska Native (14.1%) and Black persons (10.4%) and lowest among White persons (9.9%), Asian persons (7.3%), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders (6.4%). Among persons with reported ethnicity, 25.3% were Hispanic, 15.9% of whom received a positive test result. Overall, 82.0% of test results were returned within 2 days, but the percentage of test results returned within 2 days was as low as 40.7% in July 2020 and 59.3% in December 2020 during peak testing periods. Strong partnerships enabled a rapid coordinated response to establish the federally supported CBTS program to improve access to no-charge diagnostic testing, including for frontline workers, symptomatic persons and close contacts, and persons living in high-prevalence areas. In April 2021, the CBTS Pharmacies+ Testing and Surge Testing programs were expanded into the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) program. As of November 12, 2021, the CBTS and ICATT programs conducted approximately 26.6 million tests with approximately 10,000 active testing sites. Although the CBTS program represented a relatively small portion of overall U.S. SARS-CoV-2 testing, with its successful partnerships and adaptability, the CBTS program serves as a model to guide current community-based screening, surveillance, and disease control programs, and responses to future public health emergencies.","output":"Community-Based Testing Sites for SARS-CoV-2  United States, March 2020CNovember 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of COVID-19. It is not well understood how hospitals have managed VTE prevention and the effect of prevention strategies on mortality. Objective: To characterize frequency, variation across hospitals, and change over time in VTE prophylaxis and treatment-dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, as well as the association of anticoagulation strategies with in-hospital and 60-day mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 used a pseudorandom sample from 30 US hospitals in the state of Michigan participating in a collaborative quality initiative. Data analyzed were from patients hospitalized between March 7, 2020, and June 17, 2020. Data were analyzed through March 2021. Exposures: Nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis (defined as missing &#8805;2 days of VTE prophylaxis) and receipt of treatment-dose or prophylactic-dose anticoagulants vs no anticoagulation during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The effect of nonadherence and anticoagulation strategies on in-hospital and 60-day mortality was assessed using multinomial logit models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: Of a total 1351 patients with COVID-19 included (median [IQR] age, 64 [52-75] years; 47.7% women, 48.9% Black patients), only 18 (1.3%) had a confirmed VTE, and 219 (16.2%) received treatment-dose anticoagulation. Use of treatment-dose anticoagulation without imaging ranged from 0% to 29% across hospitals and increased over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.61 per week). Of 1127 patients who ever received anticoagulation, 392 (34.8%) missed 2 or more days of prophylaxis. Missed prophylaxis varied from 11% to 61% across hospitals and decreased markedly over time (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97 per week). VTE nonadherence was associated with higher 60-day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67) but not in-hospital mortality (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-1.03). Receiving any dose of anticoagulation (vs no anticoagulation) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (only prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26-0.52; any treatment dose: aHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.58). However, only the prophylactic dose of anticoagulation remained associated with lower mortality at 60 days (prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; treatment dose: aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63-1.35). Conclusions and Relevance: This large, multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, found evidence of rapid dissemination and implementation of anticoagulation strategies, including use of treatment-dose anticoagulation. As only prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower 60-day mortality, prophylactic dosing strategies may be optimal for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Trends in Venous Thromboembolism Anticoagulation in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been available in the European Union since December 2020.

Previous studies have analyzed the components of residency program websites; however, there is a paucity of information regarding EM program websites. The purpose of our study was to analyze information on EM residency program websites. METHODS: In AprilCMay 2020, we evaluated 249 United States EM residency program websites for presence or absence of 38 items relevant to EM applicants. Descriptive statistics were performed, including means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Of the 249 EM websites evaluated, the websites contained a mean of 20 of 38 items (53%). Only 16 programs (6%) contained at least three-quarters of the items of interest, and no programs contained all 38 items. The general categories with the least amount of items were social media use (9%), research (46%), and lifestyle (49%), compared to the other general categories such as application process (58%), resident information (63%), general program information (67%), and facility information (69%). The items provided by programs most often included program description (98%), blocks and rotations (91%), and faculty listing (88%). The items provided least often included housing/neighborhood information (17%) and social media links (19%).

However, the number of infections confirmed by testing underestimates the total infections as it is biased based on the availability of testing and because asymptomatic individuals may remain untested. The infection fatality rate (IFR) and infection hospitalization rate (IHR), calculated using the estimated total infections based on a representative sample of a population, is a better metric to assess the actual toll of the disease. Objective: To determine the IHR and IFR for COVID-19 using the statewide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates for the non-congregate population in Connecticut. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Participants: Individuals aged 18 years or above. Exposure: Estimated number of adults with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Main Outcome and Measures: COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Results: Of the 2.8 million individuals residing in the non-congregate settings in Connecticut through June 2020, 113,515 (90% CI 56,758-170,273) individuals had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for 'shielding', remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission's previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical. As the pandemic moves from a state of emergency into a 'new normal' in psychiatric services during second, or subsequent, waves, the use and place (if any) of remote assessments for detention needs to be considered.","output":"Limits of remote working: the ethical challenges in conducting Mental Health Act assessments during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Little is known about the community psychological and behavioral responses to influenza pandemics.

We examined trends in anxiety, risk perception, knowledge on modes of transmission, and preventive behaviors. RESULTS Respondents reported low anxiety levels throughout the epidemic. Perceived susceptibility to infection and perceived severity of H1N1 were initially high but declined early in the epidemic and remained stable thereafter. As the epidemic grew, knowledge on modes of transmission did not improve, the adoption of hygiene measures and use of face masks did not change, and social distancing declined. Greater anxiety was associated with lower reported use of hygiene measures but greater social distancing. Knowledge that H1N1 could be spread by indirect contact was associated with greater use of hygiene measures and social distancing.

We study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video stream given a larger number of participants.

METHODS: We consecutively enrolled children aged 5C17 years presenting to the pediatric emergency department with clinically suspected pneumothorax based on sudden onset of acute chest pain. After clinical examination, all children underwent lung ultrasound followed by chest X-ray (reference standard). We enrolled 77 children, of which 13 (16.9%) received a final diagnosis of pneumothorax.

Recently, a BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was introduced with a high efficacy of 95% in immunocompetent individuals. Approximately half of the patients with CLL fail to mount a humoral response to the vaccine, as detected by anti-spike antibodies. Currently, there is no data available regarding T-cell immune responses following the vaccine of these patients. Aim of the study: To investigate T-cell response determined by interferon gamma (IFN) secretion in patients with CLL following BNT162b mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, in comparison with serologic response. Methods: CLL patients from 3 medical centers in Israel were included in the study. All patients received two 30-g doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer), administered intramuscularly 3 weeks apart. For evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T-cell responses, blood samples were stimulated ex-vivo with Spike protein and secreted IFN was quantified (ELISA DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). T-cell immune response was considered to be positive for values above 25 pg/ml of Spike-specific response. T-cell subpopulations were characterized by flow cytometry (CD3, CD4, CD8). Anti-spike antibody tests were performed using the Architect AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (Abbot, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables while the Wald Chi-square test was used for comparing categorical variables. Results: 83 patients with CLL were tested for T-cell response. Blood samples were collected after a median time of 139 days post administration of the second dose of vaccine (IQ range 134-152). Out of 83 patients, 68 were eligible for the analysis (with positive internal control). Median age of the cohort was 68 years (56-72);and 44 (65%) were males. 19 (28%) patients were treatment-na?ve, most of whom were Binet stage A or B. 31 (46%) patients were on therapy: 17 with a BTK-inhibitor, and 13 with a venetoclax-based regimen. 29 (42%) patients were previously treated with anti-CD20, 13 of whom in the 12 months period prior to vaccination. T cell immune response to the vaccine was evident in 22 (32%) patients. CIRS Score>6 and specifically hypertension were statistically significantly associated with a lower T-cell response (univariate analysis, p-value<0.05). Variables that were associated with the development of T-cell response were presence of del(13q), IgM  40 mg/dL, and IgA  80 mg/dL (p-value 0.05-0.1). There was no significant difference with regards to age, gender, other CLL-specific prognostic markers, treatment, and T-cell subpopulation distribution according to flow cytometry (Table 1). The presence of T-cell response highly correlated with both the detection of anti-spike IgG antibodies following the second dose (p=0.0239) and at the time of T-cell testing (n=66, p=0.048, Table 2). While 50% of patients who tested positive for anti-spike IgG antibodies also developed positive T-cell response, only 17% of patients who did not develop T-cell response, tested positive for anti-spike antibodies. Importantly, 24% of the patients who tested negative for anti-spike IgG antibodies, developed positive T cell response. Moreover, the level of the T-cell response (log transformed) correlated linearly with (log transformed) anti-spike IgG titer (adjusted r=0.26 and p =0.026 according to Pearson correlation, Figure 1). Conclusion: We show that cellular immune response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, is blunted in most CLL patients and that there is a correlation between T-cell response and serologic response to the vaccine. These results need to be validated in a larger cohort. Figure 1 Disclosures Itchaki: AbbVie: Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding;Janssen: Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding.

One response is to re-partner tazobactam with cefepime, which is easier to protect, being less ?-lactamase labile, and to use a high-dose and prolonged infusion. On this basis, Wockhardt are developing cefepime/tazobactam (WCK 4282) as a 2+2 g q8h combination with a 90-min infusion. METHODS: The activity of cc cefepime/tazobactam was assessed, with other tazobactam combinations as comparators, against 1632 Enterobacterales, 745 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters, as submitted to the UK National Reference Laboratory. These were categorised by carbapenemase-gene detection and interpretive reading of phenotypes, with MICs determined by British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy agar dilution. RESULTS: Although higher breakpoints may be justifiable, based on the pharmacodynamics, the results were reviewed against current cefepime criteria. On this basis, cefepime/tazobactam was broadly active against Enterobacterales with AmpC enzymes and extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs), even when they had ertapenem resistance, suggesting porin loss. At 8+8 mg/L, activity extended to > 90% of Enterobacterales with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemases, although the MICs for KPC producers belonging to the international Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 lineage were higher; metallo-?-lactamase producers remained resistant. Cefepime/tazobactam was less active than ceftolozane/tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with AmpC de-repression or high-level efflux but achieved wider antipseudomonal coverage than piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity against other non-fermenters was species-specific. CONCLUSION: Overall, cefepime/tazobactam had a spectrum exceeding those of piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam and resembling or exceeding that of carbapenems. Used as a 'new-combination of old-agents' it has genuine potential to be 'carbapenem-sparing'.","output":"Cefepime/tazobactam compared with other tazobactam combinations against problem Gram-negative bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The experience of a cancer diagnosis, cancer treatments, and the tumor itself may have impacts on cognitive performance. Patients with prostate cancer are a large population who may be more vulnerable to cognitive deterioration due to older age. Understanding the occurrence of cognitive impairment among these patients is essential for developing strategies aiming to slow down the progression of cognitive deterioration, to increase patients autonomy and quality of life, and to decrease the probability of non-compliance with treatment. This study describes the prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and proposed for any type of cancer treatment. No significant differences were observed between the frequency of cognitive impairment in these patients before treatment and in the general population, suggesting that the impact of prostate cancer on cognitive performance could be negligible in the short term, contrary to what other studies have reported in other types of cancer. ABSTRACT: Cognitive impairment is common among patients with different types of cancer, even before cancer treatment, but no data were reported among patients with prostate cancer (PCa), who may be at high risk due to advanced age. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment before PCa treatment. Between February 2018 and April 2021, the NEON-PC cohort recruited 605 patients with PCa proposed for treatment at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive performance. Participants with a MoCA < 1.5 standard deviations (SD) of age- and education-specific normative values were considered to have probable cognitive impairment (PCI) and were referred for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Data from the population-based cohort EPIPorto (n = 351 men aged 40 years, evaluated in 2013C2015) were used for comparison. The prevalence of PCI was 17.4% in EPIPorto and 14.7% in NEON-PC (age- and education-adjusted odds ratio: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.58,1.18). Neuropsychological assessment was performed in 63 patients with PCa: 54.0% had cognitive impairment. These results suggest that the impact of PCa on cognitive performance could be negligible in the short term, contrary to what other studies have reported regarding other types of cancer.","output":"Prevalence of Cognitive Impairment before Prostate Cancer Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemic of COVID-19 presents a special threat to older adults. However, information on kidney damage in older patients with COVID-19 is limited. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and associated with poor prognosis. We sought to explore the association between AKI and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68C77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; p < .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that increasing odds of in-hospital mortality are associated with higher interleukin-6 on admission, myocardial injury, and AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon complication in older patients with COVID-19 but is associated with a high risk of death. Physicians should be aware of the risk of AKI in older patients with COVID-19.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury Is Associated With In-hospital Mortality in Older Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding and controlling the spread of infectious disease is a pressing issue for our society. Contemporary globally connected civilization is more at risk from various modern infectious diseases than classical ones such as pests, cholera, and tuberculosis. Over the last few years, pandemic outbreaks of highly virulent influenza, possibly related to avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and middle-eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MARSE) have been a threat. Beyond this, the intentional spread of infectious disease, e.g., bioterrorism, has come to be recognized as being just as dangerous as nuclear weapons. An infectious disease spreads on human social networks. Each individual can protect himself through several measures. Pre-emptive vaccination is thought to be most effective, although it incurs a partial cost to each individual. This brings about a social dilemma, because an individual may be able to rely on so-called herd immunity to avoid his own infection without himself being vaccinated. Also, besides vaccination, there may be several practical ways to protect against contagion, such as wearing a mask, keeping away from crowds, and self-isolation by leaving the home less often, which may be less costly and less effective than vaccination. In any case, there is a human-decision-making process regarding what steps should be taken, while the dynamics of infectious-disease spread can themselves be evaluated as a diffusion problem that has been well-studied in physics for many years. Thus, based on the concept of humanCenvironmentCsocial interaction, a basic-physics model for this diffusion problem that considers evolutionary game theory (EGT) may lead us to obtain some meaningful solutions that can be proposed to our society.

This study investigated the predictions of the public and healthcare workers (HCWs) at an early stage of the United Kingdom (UK) pandemic to assess their understanding of this novel virus and provide a reflection of the information readily available to them at the time. Method: A cross-sectional survey between the 18th and 20th March 2020 of UK adults was conducted via an anonymous 17-question online questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. Simple descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and unpaired Mann-Whitney t-tests investigated significance at the P<05 levels. Results: A total of 823 UK residents responded, of which 120% (n=99) were HCWs (doctors and nurses). The primary information sources used by our participants were BBC News, group messaging such as WhatsApp, and NHS England. The majority (389%) estimated government-enacted social restrictions would last two to four weeks. Mean best guess of total UK COVID-19 mortality was 1000 to 10,000 deaths, and the majority of participants (779%) revealed that they expected their day-to-day lives to be affected for less than six months in total. HCWs consistently estimated greater duration, scale, and impact of COVID-19 than non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs). Conclusion: Survey respondents greatly underestimated the duration and impact of COVID-19 on their personal and public lives. Non-HCWs made greater underestimates than HCWs. This provides a historical reference and highlights a lack of clear information regarding the pandemic at the time of the survey. There is an ongoing need for effective, realistic, and timely communication between government, front-line clinicians, and the general public to manage expectations of the course of the pandemic and, consequently, increase adherence to public health measures.","output":"Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Perceptions of Healthcare Workers and the General Public"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HNF1B is overexpressed in clear cell epithelial ovarian cancer, and we observed epigenetic silencing in serous epithelial ovarian cancer, leading us to hypothesize that variation in this gene differentially associates with epithelial ovarian cancer risk according to histological subtype.

COVID-19 pandemic has inadvertently exacerbated the problems of restricted access to OAT and, at the same time, has increased odds of harm due to opioid use. OBJECTIVES: We examined (a) adaptations conceived or implemented in the buprenorphine (BPN)-based OAT service delivery at the national, regional, or local level during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) the impact of such transformations on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of service delivery. We focused exclusively on BPN-based OAT. METHODS: We carried out a systematic electronic database search in PubMed and Google Scholar. We included all types of articles. Additionally, we looked up relevant websites of international and national government agencies working in the field of drug abuse. RESULTS: We included 21 articles from 10 countries in the review and summarized the results in a narrative format. The majority of literature was from developed countries. We observed changes in the BPN initiation, dosing, and dispensing protocols, and particular emphasis on telemedicine. There was limited literature on service provisions for the vulnerable population. The changing modes of service delivery have possibly increased the number of new patients and reduced the risk of exposure owing to limited in-person contact.

Complex preparation of VRIII in clinical areas and the need for frequent monitoring and adjustment increase the complexity of using VRIII. An emerging approach, called Resilient Healthcare, proposes understanding complexity of work by exploring how work is assumed to be done and compare it with everyday work. This study aimed to explore how VRIII is perceived to be used by healthcare practitioners, focusing on one aspect of Resilient Healthcare: understanding how work is assumed to be done, using a method called hierarchical task analysis (HTA). DESIGN: A qualitative study using document analysis and focus groups. SETTING: A vascular surgery unit in an acute National Health Service teaching hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Stakeholders/users in different professional roles involved in the process of using VRIII. RESULTS: The HTA showed the complexity of using VRIII and highlighted more than 115 steps required to treat elevated blood glucose. The process of producing hospital-specific guidelines was iterative. Careful consideration was taken to coordinate the development and implementation of guidelines. Documents provided detailed clinical instructions related to the use of VRIII but practitioners selectively used them, often in deference to senior colleagues. Intentional adaptations, for example, proactively asking for a VRIII prescription occurred and were acknowledged as part of providing individualised patient care. CONCLUSION: Using VRIII to treat elevated blood glucose is a complex but necessary process mediated by a range of factors such as organisational influences. Adaptive strategies to mitigate errors were common and future research can build on insights from this study to develop a broader understanding of how VRIII is used and to understand how adaptations are made in relation to the use of VRIII.","output":"Detailed analysis of work as imagined in the use of intravenous insulin infusions in a hospital: a hierarchical task analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Regional anesthesia techniques offer many benefits for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients.

METHODS The goal of this prospective quality improvement study was to develop a business case for implementation of a regional anesthesia block room and to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this program in decreasing OR time for TJA. All elective TJA patients presenting between January 2019 and March 2020 were included in our analysis. RESULTS Our detailed business plan was approved by the hospital leadership. 561 patients in the preintervention group and 432 in the postintervention group were included for data analysis. Mean total OR time per surgical case decreased from 166 to 143 min for a difference of 23 min (95% CI 17 to 29). Similarly, anesthesia controlled OR time decreased from 46 min to 26 min for a difference of 20 min (95% CI 17 to 22). The block room resulted in an additional primary TJA case per daily OR list. The percentage of TJA patients receiving a peripheral nerve block increased from 63.1% to 87.0% (p<0.001). No safety events or block room associated OR delays were observed.

The 12-month prevalence of moderate or severe symptoms was 174 and 202 per cent respectively (P = 0573). There were no significant differences between the groups in postoperative complications (337 versus 404 per cent; P = 0215), rate of recurrent hernia within 1 year (12 per cent in both groups) or quality of life. CONCLUSION The avoidance of suture fixation using a self-gripping mesh was not accompanied by a reduction in chronic symptoms after inguinal hernia repair.

Limited information is available on comparative evaluation of IgG immunoassays against a clinical reference standard, i.e., RT-PCR positivity with >20 days of illness. This study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of IgG immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard. METHODS: We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S1 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized panel of sera. 379 sera and plasma samples from RTPCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 (95 %CI 80.6-88.1), 82.6 (95 %CI 78.3-86.2) and 75.7 (95 %CI 71.0-79.9) respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5 % and 100 %, respectively. The RBD and LIAISON (S1/S2) assays showed high agreement (94.7 %; 95 %CI: 92.0, 96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positive sera/plasma than Kavach. CONCLUSION: Independent comparisons support the evaluation of performance characteristics of immunoassays. All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings.","output":"Comparative evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When we contract an infection, we typically feel sick and behave accordingly.

The aim of this study is to meet the global requirements of knowledge on ventilatory management, prepare and to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching module for non-anesthesiology trainees on COVID-19 patients. Methods: Quasi experimental cross sectional pilot study was conducted with a sample of twenty-six trainees. A teaching module was prepared and validated which consisted of lectures, audio-video sessions, demonstrations with hands-on training, debriefing, analytical-phase and reflection. Pre and Post evaluations from student t-test and direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) were used for knowledge and skill assessment respectively and feedback obtained from Likert's score. Results: Pre- and Post-tests had a mean score of 7.42  2.12 and 14.92  2.9 respectively (P value 0.00001). DOPS included 16 point score, in which 23 trainees (88.4%) met the expectations and above expectations as per training objectives. A five-point Likert's score feedback revealed satisfactory and highly satisfactory scores of 100% (ABG), 96.1% (mechanical ventilation), and 84.6% (ventilation in COVID-19 patients).

We use a dynamic factor model and panel data techniques to undertake the objectives of the paper. We show that synchronized countries (those correlated with the factor) exhibit a higher response on GDP per capita growth with variations on the global business cycle. This implies that synchronization improves growth for that group in global expansionary phases, but also implies risks during global recessions. On the contrary, the effect on growth of an economic globalization index is less relevant for synchronized countries than for asynchronized countries.

It is estimated that, globally, every fifth medical student is a smoker. So far, no research dealing with cigarette smoking among medical students has been conducted in the countries of the Western Balkans. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of cigarette smoking among Western Balkans medical students. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2452 students from 14 medical faculties in the Western Balkans (Republic of Slovenia, Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of North Macedonia and Republic of Serbia). The data were gathered through an online survey. There were significantly more non-smokers than smokers among medical students. Only gender and parents smoking status were statistically significantly associated with students smoking status. The smokers were more often male students, who lived in urban areas prior their studies, and whose parents were both smokers. With the aim of monitoring and enhancing student population health, it is necessary for public health activists and health officials to continually survey the students smoking status in order to recognize the smoking influencing factors, and form and take on appropriate activities to improve the prevention of cigarette smoking among students, as well as motivate those who smoke to give up smoking, which would contribute to improving the health of the student population.","output":"Cigarette Smoking among Medical Students from the Western Balkan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus is the causative agent of COVID-19 disease and was first identified in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 spread globally with >28 million cases and 911,000 deaths recorded worldwide as of September 12, 2020. The Philippines reported the first case of community transmission on March 5, 2020, and despite the government imposing one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in Southeast Asia, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases still surged with >250,000 cases and 4,000 deaths reported as of September 12, 2020. It is important to estimate the burden and impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the military population since this can affect the military readiness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR testing was performed on the samples. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences from 23 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from this study and sequences retrieved from GenBank and GISAID databases. RESULTS: From April 14 to August 15, 2020, a total of 12,432 specimens were tested with 763 (6%) unique individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. In the military population, majority of the patients who were tested (80%) and those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (86%) were male. Military and civilian status was available for 7,672 patients with 515/5,042 (10%) positive among military patients and 248/2,630 (9%) positive among civilian patients. Both military and civilian populations had the highest case counts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases in the 21- to 30- and 31- to 40-year-old age groups, while the 71- to 80-year-old age group had the highest proportion (18%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Sequencing analysis showed 19 different variants in the 23 genomes. Twenty of the 23 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1, 2 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1.28, and 1 genome was classified under Clade O/B.6. Twenty-two of the 23 sequences collected after June 25, 2020, contained the D614G mutation. CONCLUSION: We describe here the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing for military and civilian patients and personnel.

Other well-known functions of CK2 are in human infections; in particular, several viruses exploit host cell CK2 for their life cycle. Very recently, also SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has been found to enhance CK2 activity and to induce the phosphorylation of several CK2 substrates (either viral and host proteins). CK2 is also considered an emerging target for neurological diseases, inflammation and autoimmune disorders, diverse ophthalmic pathologies, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, CK2 activity has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, as cardiac ischemiaCreperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and cardiac hypertrophy. The hypothesis of considering CK2 inhibition for cystic fibrosis therapies has been also entertained for many years.

Its primary function is to package the genomic RNA; however, both steps of assembly and dissociation of nucleocapsid complexes (NCs) have been obscure until now; in fact, flaviviral budding is NC-free, demonstrated by the subviral particles that generally exist in flavivirus infection. In infected cells, CPs associate with lipid droplets, which possibly store CPs prior to packaging. However, the function of nuclear localization of CPs remains unknown.

STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed US neonatologists in December 2020 regarding the impact on professional and domestic work during the pandemic. We estimated associations between changes in time spent on types of professional and domestic work and demographic variables with multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 758 participants, 67.6% were women. A higher proportion of women than men were in the younger age group (63.3%, 29.3%), held no leadership position (61.4%, 46.3%), had dependents at home (68.8%, 56.3%), did not have a partner or other adult at home (10.6%, 3.2%), and had an employed partner (88.1%, 64.6%; P<.01 for all). A higher proportion of women than men reported a decrease in time spent on scholarly work (35.0%, 29.0%, P=.02) and career development (44.2%, 34.9%, P<.01). A higher proportion of women than men reported spending more time caring for children (74.2%, 55.8%, P<0.01). Reduced time spent on career development was associated with younger age (aOR=2.21; 95% CI, 1.20, 4.08) and number of dependents (aOR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.45).

Purpose: With the research, we wanted to determine what challenges students at higher vocational schools perceived during the e-learning process. Due to the sudden appearance of COVID-19, the educational approach swiftly changed, and both teachers and students were faced with many challenges. Method: Content analysis was used on domestic and international research studies. The literature was reviewed and analyzed using keywords. For the empirical research, we collected data by surveying students from the southeastern part of Slovenia in seven different short cycle higher education programs. The questionnaire was designed based on self-evaluation reports and previously analyzed professional literature dealing with this area. Results: Results are depicted based on the challenges that students faced in the sudden onset of e-learning due to the pandemic. By following recommendations provided by students, teachers were able to improve their e-learning approach, in which everyone was involved, and thus facilitated the learning process. Organization: The results of the research enable schools to implement the identified challenges that students perceived during the educational process to improve e-learning. The research findings portray a possible answer on what needs to be improved in e-learning and how to adapt approaches in a way that is tailored to the student. Society: Recognizing students' e-learning challenges is the foundation for improving the entire e-learning process, which contributes to better achievement of educational goals and greater contribution of knowledge to society. Originality: Several studies on e-learning have already been conducted, but we have not found any that address the challenges posed by short cycle higher education students in the face of the immediate and unexpected introduction of e-learning due to the global health situation. Limitations/Future Research: We have limited ourselves to research that has already been conducted in this area. The resulting questionnaire was created as a pilot survey on a larger sample to determine reliability and to obtain a starting point for implementing improvements in practice and the possibility of further testing on an even larger number of students. The research also offers a starting point for the preparation of a questionnaire intended for higher education teachers who already have conducted e-learning.Alternate abstract:Raziskovalno vpra?anje (RV): Katere izzive so ?tudentje pri nenadnem prehodu na e-izobra?evanje zaradi pojava virusa covid-19 prepoznali?

This prospective longitudinal study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents mental health and substance use, and by assessing specific positive coping strategies among adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using multi-group autoregressive cross-lagged path models, the present study explored the reciprocal influence of positive coping behaviors on multiple adjustment outcomes including mental health symptoms, substance use, stress, and worry. Participants included 238 adolescents (132 male participants; ages 15C17; 118 with ADHD). Parents provided ratings of adolescent routines, and adolescents provided ratings of coping behaviors and psychological adjustment in spring (May/June), summer (July/August), and fall (October/November) 2020. All models included the effects of adjustment at the prior timepoint as well as relevant covariates including adolescent race, ethnicity, sex, medication status, and family income. Adolescents with ADHD were at greater risk for experiencing increases in mental health symptoms and substance use throughout the pandemic, relative to adolescents without ADHD. The use of positive coping strategies and adolescent routines buffered against increases in substance use and mental health problems for adolescents with ADHD. These findings have important clinical and public policy relevance for parents, schools, and employers who may aim to prioritize keeping schedules as consistent as possible to promote healthy adjustment.

We undertake a data-driven approach to explore the energy impacts of work-from-home norms across five dwelling typologies. Our methodology includes climate correction, dimensionality reduction and machine learning-based clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models of daily load curves. Results show that during the lockdown, maximum daily peak demand increased by 150C200% as compared to 2018 and 2019 levels for one room-units (RM1), one bedroom-units (BR1) and two bedroom-units (BR2) which are typical for low- and middle-income families. While the upper-middle- and higher-income dwelling units (i.e., three (3BR) and more-than-three bedroom-units (M3BR)) saw night-time demand rise by almost 44% in 2020, as compared to 2018 and 2019 levels. Our results also showed that new peak demand emerged for the lockdown period for RM1, BR1 and BR2 dwelling typologies. We found that the lack of supporting socioeconomic and climatic data can restrict a comprehensive analysis of demand shocks using similar public datasets, which informed policy implications for India's digitalisation.

The vital role of interstitial space in malaria infection and treatment has been neglected current research efforts. We confirmed the reinfection capacity of parasites sequestrated in interstitial space, which replenish the mechanism of recurrence. Malaria parasite-infected mice were treated with artemisinin-loaded liposomes through the interstitial space and exhibited a better therapeutic response. Notably, compared with oral administration, interstitial administration showed an unexpectedly high activation and recruitment of immune cells, and resulted in better clearance of sequestered parasites from organs, and enhanced pathological recovery. The interstitial route of administration prolongs the blood circulation time of artemisinin and increases its plasma concentration, and may compensate for the inefficiency of oral administration and the nanotoxicity of intravenous administration, providing a potential strategy for infectious disease therapy.","output":"Neglected interstitial space in malaria recurrence and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lake eutrophication has become a critical environmental issue due to the global effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change, and has been comprehensively studied for many years. A series of models and indicators have been proposed to assess the trophic state of lakes. The trophic state index (TSI) is a synthetic index that integrates chlorophyll-a, water clarity, and total phosphorus and is widely used to evaluate the trophic state of aquatic environments. In this study, we collected in situ lake samples (N=431) from typical lakes to match Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data using the Case 2 Regional Coast Color processor. Then we developed a new empirical model, TSI = C34.04  (band 4/band 5) C 1.114  (band 1/band 4) + 97.376). This model is valid for all of China, with good performance and few errors (RMSE=7.36;MAE=6.25) for the validation dataset. Recognizing that over 94% of the Chinese population located along eastern watersheds and large lakes have competing water uses, and given the TSI model on the seasonal scales, we further estimated the mean TSI and trophic state in eastern Chinese lakes (> 100 km2) from 2019 to 2020. The results revealed that more lakes were eutrophic in autumn (94.28%) than in spring (> 77.14%), indicating a serious eutrophication of eastern lakes. Although the eastern lakes have been studied in more detail, this study found that eutrophication still has markedly negative impacts on lake ecosystems. In addition, no significant improvement was observed in spring, most likely due to the months of curfew/lockdown from January 2020 onwards due to COVID-19. This may be due to the enrichment of nutrients deposited in sediment or watershed soil, which can be characterized as autochthonous sources of lake eutrophication, over decades with high rates of economic development. This study demonstrates the applicability of Sentinel-2 MSI data to monitor lake eutrophication as well as the feasibility of blue/red and red/red edge combinations. The framework and TSI model used bands available on MSI sensors to develop a novel approach for generating historical eutrophication data for large-scale evaluation of and decision-making related aquatic environmental changes, even in poorly studied areas.","output":"Mapping the Trophic State Index of Eastern Lakes in China using an Empirical Model and Sentinel-2 Imagery Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study used data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study to investigate the association between financial hardship and retirement planning behaviors.

It has deeply shaken different industries and the overall economy. Many businesses were closed during this disease outbreak, but the construction industry continued to operate while others struggled. As the pandemic spread, the intensity of social media interactions dramatically increased as people started maintaining physical distances and staying at home. Recent studies have shown that social media serves the purpose of disseminating information in major crises and such social interactions correlate with what happens in the real world. Unlike traditional media, social media data also offered sufficient statistical power to understand risk communication patterns. The construction industry adopted innovative strategies to continue its operations and activities while responding to a number of concerns associated with health risks of the workers on site. This study aims at identifying the emerging communication patterns of construction stakeholders on social media (Twitter) during COVID-19. Around 12 million tweets were collected in the early days of the ongoing pandemic (March, April, and May 2020) by Twitter Application Programming Interface (API), in the region of North America;then filtered this data based on keywords pertaining to COVID-19 and construction activities. Such information was processed by applying several machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The spatiotemporal patterns of construction risk communication revealed in this study would support policymakers, businesses, and other industries to take more efficient measures and be more resilient both in the current and future pandemics.","output":"COVID-19: Understanding Construction Industry Responses on Twitter in the Emergence of Novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has raised concerns about infection control all over the world.

Understanding exactly how European nations have arrived at this point, and the process by which they have done this, is key to learning constructive lessons for future pandemic risk management. Bringing together experience from across five European nations (the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland), this paper outlines what has occurred between September 2020 and mid-January 2021. Our analysis draws out several themes important to understanding the different national risk management approaches adopted, namely: the extent to which lessons were learned or overlooked from the first wave of the pandemic;the relationship between science and policy;the speed and responsiveness of policy decisions;and differing levels of reliance on individual responsibility for safeguarding public health. Subsequently, we recommended that: there is more involvement of decision scientists and risk analysts in COVID-19 decision making, who have largely been absent thus far;the epidemiological science should be followed where possible, but when value judgments are made this should be clearly and transparently communicated;proactive measures avoiding policy delay should be followed to reduce the rate of infection and excess deaths;governments must avoid confusing or inconsistent regional implementation and communication of interventions;rebuilding public trust is key to promoting public compliance and support for COVID-19 health measures;overreliance on individual responsibility as the focus of non-pharmaceutical interventions should be avoided;public compliance with COVID-19 restrictions requires pre-tested simple messages;open and consistent engagement with local leaders and officials should become a mainstay of government efforts to help ensure consistent adoption of nationwide COVID-19 policy measures.","output":"COVID-19: the winter lockdown strategy in five European nations.

We sought to compare outcomes between high dose radiotherapy (HDRT) [>48.85 Gy biologically effective dose (BED)] group and low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) (48.85 Gy BED) for patients with EC receiving cnCRT. Methods Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched independently by two members of our team on August 07, 2017. Articles were screened using Covidence. Study quality was assessed via CONSORT. Eligible studies had to be randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing cnCRT vs. surgery alone in full-text English. Those with induction or sequential chemoradiotherapy were excluded. We captured data points including radiation dose, hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), and treatment-related mortality (TRM). We analyzed HRs for OS and risk ratio (RR) for TRM and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) as the summary statistic. We used both fixed- and random-effects models in the presence of heterogeneity. The primary outcome was OS; secondary endpoint was treatment related mortality (TRM). We compared outcomes by HDRT vs. LDRT. To minimize chemotherapy heterogeneity, we performed a pre-planned analysis excluding the CROSS trial. Results The eleven included studies contained a total of 1,697 patients. Eight hundred forty-eight were randomized into the cnCRT. Of these 848 patients, 287 received HDRT and 561 received LDRT. HR for OS was not statistically different between LDRT (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.8) and HDRT (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-0.91). Excluding the CROSS trial, there was still no difference in outcomes between LDRT and HDRT. TRM was similar between LDRT and HDRT. Conclusions With no difference in OS or TRM between LDRT and HDRT, 48.85 Gy BED cnCRT may be a sufficient radiation dose for cnCRT for patients with EC fit for surgery.","output":"Optimal radiation dosing in concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation for resectable esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the dynamical behavior of a SEIR epidemic system that takes into account governmental action and individual reaction is investigated The transmission rate takes into account the impact of governmental action modeled as a step function while the decreasing contacts among individuals responding to the severity of the pandemic is modeled as a decreasing exponential function We show that the proposed model is capable of predicting Hopf bifurcation points for a wide range of physically realistic parameters for the COVID-19 disease In this regard, the model predicts periodic behavior that emanates from one Hopf point The model also predicts stable oscillations connecting two Hopf points The effect of the different model parameters on the existence of such periodic behavior is numerically investigated Useful diagrams are constructed that delineate the range of periodic behavior predicted by the model","output":"Bifurcation analysis of a SEIR epidemic system with governmental action and individual reaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has caught many nations by surprise and has already caused millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.

In this paper, authors from several of the key countries involved in COVID\\\\19 propose a holistic systems model that views the problem from a perspective of human society including the natural environment, human population, health system, and economic system. We model the crisis theoretically as a feedback control problem with delay, and partial controllability and observability.

Each conceptual scenario is subject to 1000+ Monte\\\\Carlo simulations and yields both expected and surprising results. For example, we demonstrate through computational experiments that maintaining strict confinement policies for longer than 60 days may indeed be able to suppress lethality below 1% and yield the best health outcomes, but cause economic damages due to lost work that could turn out to be counterproductive in the long term.

We assessed patterns of greenspace use in relation to individual and environmental factors and their relationship with experiencing psychological symptoms under the pandemic. We conducted an online survey recruiting participants from social media for adults in Korea for SeptemberCDecember 2020. The survey collected data on demographics, patterns of using greenspace during the pandemic, and major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) were applied to identify probable cases of MD and GAD. A logistic regression model assessed the association decreased visits to greenspace after the outbreak compared to 2019 and probable MD and GAD. Among the 322 survey participants, prevalence of probable MD and GAD were 19.3% and 14.9%, respectively. High rates of probable MD (23.3%) and GAD (19.4%) were found among persons currently having job-related and financial issues. Of the total participants, 64.9% reported decreased visits to greenspace after the COVID-19 outbreak. Persons with decreased visits to greenspace had 2.06 higher odds (95% CI: 0.91, 4.67, significant at p < 0.10) of probable MD at the time of the survey than persons whose visits to greenspace increased or did not change. Decreased visits to greenspace were not significantly associated with GAD (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63, 3.34). Findings suggest that barriers to greenspace use could deprive people of mental health benefits and affect mental health during pandemic; an alternative explanation is that those experiencing poor mental health may be less likely to visit greenspaces during pandemic.

We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.7  10-12 M to 6.7  10-15 M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC50 < 6.7  10-12 M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","output":"IgV somatic mutation of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies governs neutralization and breadth of reactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasingly global context in which businesses operate supports innovation, but also increases uncertainty around supply chain disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly shows the lack of resilience in supply chains and the impact that disruptions may have on a global network scale as individual supply chain connections and nodes fail. This cascading failure underscores the need for the network analysis and advanced resilience analytics we find lacking in the existing supply chain literature. This paper reviews supply chain resilience literature that focuses on resilience modeling and quantification and connects the supply chain to other networks, including transportation and command and control. We observe a fast increase in the number of relevant papers (only 47 relevant papers were published in 2007-2016, while 94 were found in 2017-2019). We observe that specific disruption scenarios are used to develop and test supply chain resilience models, while uncertainty associated with threats including consideration of \\"unknown unknowns\\" remains rare. Publications that utilize more advanced models often focus just on supply chain networks and exclude associated system components such as transportation and command and control (C2) networks, which creates a gap in the research that needs to be bridged.

In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.","output":"The Non-Specific Antiviral Activity of Polysulfates to Fight SARS-CoV-2, its Mutants and Viruses with Cationic Spikes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Epidemiological studies observed gender differences in COVID-19 outcomes, however, whether sex hormone plays a causal in COVID-19 risk remains unclear. This study aimed to examine associations of sex hormone, sex hormones-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and COVID-19 risk. Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study was performed to explore the causal associations between testosterone, estrogen, SHBG, IGF-1and the risk of COVID-19 (susceptibility, hospitalization and severity) using GWAS summary level data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (N=1,348,701). Random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR approach was used as the primary MR method and the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO test were conducted as sensitivity analyses. Findings: Higher genetically predicted IGF-1 levels were significantly associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and hospitalization. For one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted IGF-1 levels, the odds ratio was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.97;P =0.027) for COVID-19 susceptibility, 0.62 (95%CI: 0.25-0.51;P =0.018) for COVID-19 hospitalization, and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.52-1.38, P =0.513) for COVID-19 severity. There was no evidence that testosterone, estrogen, SHBG are associated with the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severity in either overall or sex-stratified TSMR analysis. Interpretation: Genetically predicted high IGF-1 levels may decrease the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and hospitalization. Further studies are needed to explore whether IGF-1 could be a potential intervention target to reduce COVID-19 risk.

The present work details a component piece of an ongoing body of research into multi-UAS operations. Beginning in early 2020, NASA has collaborated with Uber Technologies to design and develop concepts of operations, roles and responsibilities, and ground control station (GCS) concepts to enable food delivery operations via multiple, small UAS (sUAS). A cognitive walkthrough was chosen as the method for data collection. This allowed information to be gathered from UAS subject matter experts (SMEs) that could further mature designs for future human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations;in addition, it allowed information to be collected remotely during the stringent restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the described cognitive walkthrough activity utilized remote data collection protocols mediated through the usage of programs designed for presentation and telecommunications. Scenarios were designed, complete with airspace, contingencies, and remedial actions, to be presented to the SMEs. Information was collected using a combination of rating scales and open-ended questions. Results received from the SMEs revealed expected hazards, workloads, and information concerns inherent in the contingency scenarios.

METHODS: We reviewed data on ED arrivals of adolescents and young adults (aged 13C24 years) in the weeks immediately before and after the Italian lockdown release in 2020, and in the same periods in 2019, with a focus on cases of severe alcohol abuse, psychomotor agitation, and other mental issues. RESULTS: The relative frequency of severe alcohol intoxications increased from .88% during the last part of the lockdown to 11.3% after lockdown release. When comparing these data with the same period in 2019, a highly significant difference emerged, with severe alcohol intoxications accounting for 11.31% of ED visits versus 2.96%, respectively.

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIVCSIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained.

Methods: To characterize the vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the child care workforce. Providers were identified through various national databases and state registries. A link to the survey was sent via email between May 26 and June 23, 2021. Out of 44,771 potential respondents, 21,663 responded (48.4%). Results: Overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers (78.1%, 95% CI [77.3% to 78.9%]) was higher than that of the U.S. adult population (65%). Vaccination rates varied from 53.5% to 89.4% between states.

Data suggests a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in ventilated patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and the diagnostic yield of Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for PE. We also examined the utility of D-dimer and conventional pre-test probability for diagnosis of PE in COVID-19. PATIENTS/METHODS: Retrospective review of single-centre data of all CTPA studies in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 identified from Electronic Patient Records (EPR). RESULTS: There were 1477 patients admitted with COVID-19 and 214 CTPA scans performed, of which n = 180 (84%) were requested outside of critical care. The diagnostic yield for PE was 37%. The overall proportion of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 5.4%. The proportions with Wells score of &#8805;4 ('PE likely') was 33/134 (25%) without PE vs 20/80 (25%) with PE (P = 0.951). The median National Early Warning-2 (NEWS2) score (illness severity) was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-9) in PE group vs 4 (IQR 2-7) in those without PE (P = 0.133). D-dimer was higher in PE (median 8000 ng/mL; IQR 4665-8000 ng/mL) than non-PE (2060 ng/mL, IQR 1210-4410 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the 'low probability' group, D-dimer was higher (P < 0.001) in those with PE but had a limited role in excluding PE. CONCLUSIONS: Even outside of the critical care environment, PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is common. Of note, approaching half of PE events were diagnosed on hospital admission. More data are needed to identify an optimal diagnostic pathway in patients with COVID-19. Randomised controlled trials of intensified thromboprophylaxis are urgently needed.","output":"Pulmonary embolism in hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic relapsing inflammatory disease. The pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear, which may involve environmental factors, genetic factors, intestinal microbiota disorder, and abnormal immune responses. Exosomes (30C150 nm) are found in various body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication and regulate cell biological activity by carrying non-coding RNAs, proteins, and lipids. There is evidence that exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. In view of the important roles of exosomes in the pathogenesis of IBD, this work systematically reviews the latest research progress of exosomes in IBD, especially the roles of exosomes as non-coding RNA delivery systems in the pathogenesis of IBD, including a disordered immune response, barrier function, and intestinal microbiota. The review will help to clarify the pathogenesis of IBD and explore new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for patients with IBD.","output":"Exosomes as a New Delivery Vehicle in Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although psychological researchers have long studied the implications of major crises, the outbreak and spread of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic have confronted the global community of psychologists and psychological researchers with new challenges.

To evaluate the effect of overexpression of chemokines on RABV infection, chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), RANTES, and IP-10 were individually cloned into the genome of attenuated RABV strain HEP-Flury. These recombinant RABVs were characterized in vitro for growth properties and expression of chemokines. It was found that all the recombinant viruses grew as well as the parent virus, and each of the viruses expressed the intended chemokine in a dose-dependent manner. When these viruses were evaluated for pathogenicity in the mouse model, it was found that overexpression of MIP-1alpha further decreased RABV pathogenicity by inducing a transient innate immune response. In contrast, overexpression of RANTES or IP-10 increased RABV pathogenicity by causing neurological diseases, which is due to persistent and high-level expression of chemokines, excessive infiltration and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system, and severe enhancement of blood-brain barrier permeability. These studies indicate that overexpression of chemokines, although important in controlling virus infection, may not always be beneficial to the host.","output":"The roles of chemokines in rabies virus infection: overexpression may not always be beneficial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread damage in the lungs in the setting of an overzealous immune response whose origin remains unclear. We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both. Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19, which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.

There are two strategies aimed at the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vectors. The first includes an insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. The second strategy is antigen incorporation into the viral capsid proteins. To extend this methodology, we have searched for new sites at the human adenovirus serotype 5 major capsid protein hexon for a vaccine antigen insertion. To this end, we utilized sites in the hexon hypervariable region (HVR) 7, 8 and 9 to display a 15-mer peptide containing the main neutralizing epitope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. However, we could not rescue the viruses with the insertions of the peptide into HVR 8 and 9, consistent with the viruses being unable to tolerate insertions at these sites.

Factors contributing to higher SLS rates are unknown, and knowledge of SLS prevalence within oncologic training is lacking. SLS frequency was measured for evaluations from all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs at a single cancer care institution between 2014 and 2018. SLS prevalence was estimated using hierarchical linear models (HLM) that considered characteristics of evaluator, trainee, and evaluation potentially related to SLS. Results were compared with national SLS rates. Six thousand one hundred sixty evaluations were included from 476 evaluators. Overall prevalence of SLS was 12.1% (95% CI 4.5-28.8). Residents (vs fellows) were less likely to have SLS evaluations (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8), though for all trainees increasing training year corresponded with increasing SLS frequency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). SLS was more common in procedural specialties compared with medical specialties (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a wait-list for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting the accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six studies totaling 16 149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity compared to single genes (80.8% [75.1%, 85.4%] vs. 57.8% [52.3%, 63.1%]) with no significant decrease in specificity (87.8% [84.1%, 90.7%] vs. 92.1% [90.4%, 93.5%]).

Because neurodegeneration limits capacity for neuroplasticity, it is not clear whether AE would induce CSE changes in people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS People with progressive MS (n = 10) requiring ambulatory assistive devices completed a graded maximal exercise test. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify body fat and lean mass. Before and following one 40-minute AE session using body weight-supported (<10% support) treadmill at moderate intensity, CSE was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Variables included resting and active motor thresholds, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, recruitment curves, and length of the cortical silent period (CSP). RESULTS Aerobic exercise reduced inhibition (shorter CSP) and increased excitation (increased MEP amplitude) only in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand. Controlling for age, higher fitness and lower body fat significantly predicted exercise-induced reduction in resting motor threshold (R = +0.458, P = 0.046) and CSP (R = +0.568, P = 0.030), respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite high levels of disability, capacity for exercise-induced neuroplasticity was retained among people with progressive MS. The hemisphere contralateral to the weaker hand was resistant to exercise-induced CSE changes, suggesting less neuroplastic potential. Lower fitness and higher body fat were associated with diminished exercise-induced CSE benefits, suggesting that therapists should consider interventions aimed at improving fitness and combating sedentarism to ultimately enhance the benefits of exercise on the brain.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A302).","output":"Exercise-Induced Brain Excitability Changes in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions of higher education in almost every nation closed in the first half of 2020. University administrators are now facing decisions about how to safely return students, staff and faculty to campus. To provide a framework to evaluate various strategies, we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. Our goals were to support the immediate pandemic planning at our own university, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. We parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size private university in Atlanta, Georgia. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explore a range of screening and testing frequencies and perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of input parameters. We find that monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 42% and 80% in students, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay results in an 88%, 79% and 67% reduction in cumulative incidence in students over the semester, respectively. Similar reductions are observed among staff and faculty. A testing strategy requires far fewer diagnostic assays to be implemented than a screening assay. Our intervention model is conservative in that we assume a fairly high reproductive number that is not reduced through social distancing measures. We find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, but that cases, hospitalization, and (in some scenarios) deaths may still occur.

Understanding what influences the uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand and respiratory hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing could help to inform the development of effective public health advice messages. The aim of this synthesis was to explore public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory infections. METHODS: Five online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) were systematically searched. Reference lists of articles were also examined. We selected papers that used a qualitative research design to explore perceptions and beliefs about non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission of acute respiratory infections. We excluded papers that only explored how health professionals or children viewed non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. Three authors performed data extraction and assessment of study quality. Thematic analysis and components of meta-ethnography were adopted to synthesise findings. RESULTS: Seventeen articles from 16 studies in 9 countries were identified and reviewed. Seven key themes were identified: perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions, personal and cultural beliefs about infection transmission, diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections, perceived vulnerability to infection, anxiety about emerging respiratory infections and communications about emerging respiratory infections. The synthesis showed that some aspects of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control (particularly hand and respiratory hygiene) were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take. There was ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours in some contexts due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma. Common perceived barriers included beliefs about infection transmission, personal vulnerability to respiratory infection and concerns about self-diagnosis in emerging respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: People actively evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms of their perceived necessity, efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility. To enhance uptake, it will be necessary to address key barriers, such as beliefs about infection transmission, rejection of personal risk of infection and concern about the potential costs and stigma associated with some interventions.","output":"Public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing transmission of respiratory infection: systematic review and synthesis of qualitative studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is a versatile plant exploited by the pharmaceutical and food industries. Unfortunately, it is also infamously known as a source of highly addictive narcotics, primarily heroin. Drug abuse has devastating consequences for users and also has many direct or indirect negative impacts on human society as a whole. Therefore, developing a molecular genetic tool for the individualization of opium poppy, raw opium or heroin samples could help in the fight against the drug trade by retrieving more information about the source of narcotics and linking isolated criminal cases. Bioinformatic analysis provided insight into the distribution, density and other characteristics of roughly 150 thousand microsatellite loci within the poppy genome and indicated underrepresentation of microsatellites with the desired attributes. Despite this fact, 27 polymorphic STR markers, divided into three multiplexed assays, were developed in this work. Internal validation confirmed species-specific amplification, showed that the optimal amount of DNA is within the range of 0.625C1.25 ng per reaction, and indicate relatively well balanced assays according to the metrics used. Moreover, the stutter ratio (mean + 3 SD 2.28C15.59%) and allele-specific stutters were described.

This sudden change in the dental education program may have affected the academic standards of dental students. This study aimed to evaluate the overall satisfaction and effectiveness of online learning in pediatric dentistry of undergraduate dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was sent to three dental schools, and responses were collected from dental school students. Questions included the demographics, perspectives of online classes, comparison of online and offline pediatric dentistry classes and opinions on how dental schools are handling the pandemic. Students perspectives on online classes were evaluated based on satisfaction with online education. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Most students took online classes from home (80.9%) using Zoom (50.4%). The majority reported overall program satisfaction (74.1%) and agreed that universities implemented online classes well (55%). Students who were in favor of online classes responded more positively to questions on the effectiveness and safety of online learning (p < 0.05). Regardless of satisfaction with online education, the students agreed that the online education shift was the right decision in pandemic outbreak.

We assessed the feasibility of a strategy that allows the flexibility of postmanufacture mixture of vaccine and adjuvant at the point of care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial among healthy adults aged 18C49 years who received 2 doses of inactivated influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 clade 2.2.3) virus vaccine containing either 3.75, 7.5, or 15 g of hemagglutinin (HA) with or without AS03 adjuvant, administered 21 days apart. Subjects were observed for local (injection site) and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. Sera were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody levels against the homologous strain and 4 heterologous avian strains. RESULTS: Vaccine containing ASO3 adjuvant was associated with significantly more local reactions compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, but these were short-lived and resolved spontaneously. Although the immune response to nonadjuvanted vaccine was poor, 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing as little as 3.75 g of HA elicited robust immune responses resulting in seroprotective titers (1:40) to the homologous strain in 86% of subjects by HAI and in 95% of subjects by MN. Cross-clade antibody responses were also observed with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, but not nonadjuvanted vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: AS03 adjuvant formulated with inactivated vaccine at the administration site significantly enhanced the immune responses to H5N1 vaccine and has the potential to markedly improve vaccine responses and accelerate delivery during an influenza pandemic.

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008). Other significant covariates included testing positive for other drugs (OR = 10.79, 95% CI 4.60 to 26.97) and length of treatment (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS Our data support an association between the lockdown due to COVID-19 and increased alcohol use in patients with AUD.

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network.

Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified. We focus on Singapore as a case study that has recently deployed contact tracing wearables nationally, but also reference debate about wearables in Australia and New Zealand.

reported a higher than expected compliance discordant to the degree of hypoxemia Our goal was to evaluate survival of patients with C-ARDS according to different lung mechanical parameters METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of C-ARDS patients admitted to the ICU at a tertiary care hospital in Michigan (March 1st to May 1st, 2020) Subjects were enrolled at the time of intubation and followed until death or discharge The average lung compliance (AvC) measured in ml/cm H2O and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) were calculated daily over the first 7 days post-intubation Median differences in AvC and P/F ratio between alive and deceased participants were calculated using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Pearson correlation was used to describe the relationship between AvC and P/F ratio Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explain co-variate effect after adjustment Survival function was performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator for different levels of AvC RESULTS: 135 patients were included;mortality was 41 4% (n=56) Baseline demographics were similar between the survivor and deceased groups, except for hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) trending towards significance in the latter Survivors had longer length of stay (34 7 days vs 17 6 days;p = 0 001) There was no significant correlation between AvC and P/F ratio (Pearson's r 0 09;p=0 31) Surviving and deceased patients had different median P/F values (185 [IQR 242 to 135] vs 150 [IQR 196 to 109];p=0 01), but did not differ significantly in terms of median AvC (29 [IQR 35 to 26] vs 31 [IQR 37 to 24];p 0 69) There was no difference in survival curves between AvC levels of 35, 40 and 45 A multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to adjust for gender, BMI, hypertension, coronary artery disease and ventilator length of stay Only age [OR =1 05, 95% CI: 1 02, 1 08, p 0 003] and PF value [OR = 0 98, 95% CI: 0 98, 0 99, p 0 001] were significant risk factors for mortality CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low P/F ratio and advanced age are the most significant independent predictors of mortality in C-ARDS The severity of hypoxemia did not correlate significantly with lung elasticity, and lung compliance was not predictive of mortality Our findings are consistent with other reports on lung mechanics in C-ARDS (Schenck et al) CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As with typical ARDS, degree of hypoxemia at the onset of respiratory failure may have prognostic implications in patients with

Testing rates were calculated as number of tested for SARS-CoV-2 divided by population at risk; test positivity rates were calculated as positive tests divided by total number of tests. In-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) was calculated based on hospitalized positive admissions with outcome data who died in-hospital and whose death was judged SARS-CoV-2 related by attending physician. FINDINGS: 315 570 children aged <18 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2; representing 8.9% of all 3 548 738 tests and 1.6% of all children in the country.

It is unknown whether stratification as low risk remains valid over time, raising the potential risk of harm during this period if left unmonitored. This study aimed to evaluate whether Rapid Glaucoma Assessment Clinics (RGACs) are an effective method of assessing low-risk patients in order to identify those who may need an escalation of care, therefore reducing the risk of the future incidents of preventable vision loss. METHODS: RGACs were developed which comprised a brief advance telephone history by a clinician and then ophthalmic technician-measured visual acuity and intraocular pressure in clinic. We report outcomes from the first month of operation describing attendance patterns, the proportion of patients from this low risk cohort requiring escalation and underlying reasons for treatment escalations. RESULTS: 639 patients were invited to attend RGACs. 75% attended their booked appointment. Pre-attendance telephone consultations were associated with lower non-attendance rates (13.9% vs 29.3%, p < 0.00001). 15% of patients were no longer deemed to remain at low risk with further expedited clinical review scheduled. 10.4% of patients required an escalation in treatment following review.

Flow diversion is a viable treatment in this population. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients treated at our center from May 2017 to December 2020 who underwent flow diversion for an ACA aneurysm at or distal to the anterior communicating artery (ACOM). We defined ACA aneurysms as any aneurysm involving the ACOM itself, at the junction of the ACA with the ACOM (A1/A2), or in distal A2/A3 branches; both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms were included. Baseline and follow-up clinical and angiographic data were collected; the primary measure was elimination of the aneurysm on follow-up angiogram. Patients underwent flow diversion with a Pipeline stent. A single flow diverting stent was placed in the dominant ACA spanning from the A2 segment extending into the A1 segment; two patients required H-pipe technique. Distal aneurysms were treated with a single Pipeline device deployed across the parent vessel, covering the aneurysm. RESULTS: Two-seven patients underwent a total of 28 flow diversion procedures; median age was 57 and 16 (59.3%) were male. Thirteen (48.2%) patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage; of these, four were treated within 6 weeks of the index hemorrhage. Most patients (22; 81.5%) had significant ACA asymmetry. There was one postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage and one groin complication. Follow-up data were available for 19 patients, 15 (78.9%) of which showed no residual aneurysm and 17 (89.5%) had protection of the dome. CONCLUSION: Flow diversion of ACA aneurysms can be a primary treatment modality in an unruptured aneurysm or a complement to initial coil protection of a ruptured aneurysm. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.","output":"Flow diversion in anterior cerebral artery aneurysms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension is the leading single preventable risk factor for death worldwide, and most of the disease burden attributed to hypertension weighs on low-and middle-income countries.

Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million). We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n = 2979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests. Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5C12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.22C1.78) and household income < $50,000 (vs. > $100,000: PR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79). Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~ 12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.","output":"Estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among adults in Orange County, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The recovery of other pathogens in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology, and outcomes of co-infection and superinfection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through February 8, 2021. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or superinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines, and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763. RESULTS: Of 6639 articles screened, 118 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-25%, I2 = 98%) and that of superinfection was 24% (95% CI: 19%-30%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or superinfection were: viral co-infections, 10% (95% CI: 6%-14%); viral superinfections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-10%); bacterial co-infections, 8% (95% CI: 5%-11%); bacterial superinfections, 20% (95% CI: 13%-28%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); and fungal superinfections, 8% (95% CI: 4%-13%). Patients with a co-infection or superinfection had higher odds of dying than those who only had SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.82-5.99). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with superinfections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation (45% [95% CI: 33%-58%] vs. 10% [95% CI: 5%-16%]), but patients with co-infections had a greater average length of hospital stay than those with superinfections (mean = 29.0 days, standard deviation [SD] = 6.7 vs. mean = 16 days, SD = 6.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that as many as 19% of patients with COVID-19 have co-infections and 24% have superinfections. The presence of either co-infection or superinfection was associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality.

The return of infected pilgrims to their home countries with a putative spread of MERS\\\\CoV necessitates further surveillance. METHODS: A cross sectional study of 839 adult African Hajj pilgrims returning to Accra in Ghana, West Africa, was conducted in 2013 to assess the prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as of MERS\\\\CoV, human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (FLU A) infection. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty\\\\one (77.6%) pilgrims had respiratory symptoms. Tests were positive for at least one of the viruses other than MERS\\\\CoV in 179 (21.3%) of all pilgrims, with 22.4% detection in symptomatic vs. 17.6% detection in asymptomatic pilgrims. No MERS\\\\CoV was detected, although common respiratory viruses were prevalent, with positive findings for HRV in 141 individuals (16.8%), RSV in 43 individuals (5.1%) and FLU A in 11 individuals (1.3%). Results were positive for more than one virus in 16 (1.9%) individuals, including 14 (1.7%) RSV/HRV co\\\\infections and 2 (0.2%) FLU A/HRV co\\\\infections. A total 146 (22.4%) of the symptomatic returnees tested positive for at least one respiratory virus compared with 33 (17.6%) of the asymptomatic pilgrims who had at least one detectable virus in their sample. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was high.

METHODS: According to the date of declaration of mandatory social distance, we separated patients into 2 groups over a 1-year period: Period A and period B. We assessed the overall time to surgery, delay in surgery (> 24 hours, > 36 hours, and > 48 hours), reason of delay, length of hospital stay, type of surgery, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The number of operated hip fractures and other trauma decreased in period B compared with period A by 17%, and 23%, respectively. The number of patients with delay in surgery by > 24 hours and > 36 hours was significantly higher in period B compared to that in period A (P = 0.035, P = 0.012, respectively). However, no significant difference in the number of delay in surgery > 48 hours and mean overall time to surgery between the 2 groups was observed (P = 0.856, P = 0.399, respectively). There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay, type of surgery, and postoperative complications between periods A and B. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the decrease in hip fractures was relatively fewer compared to the decrease in orthopedic trauma.

Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify requirements to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for each resource. These requirements can take form in location constraints (e.g. A hospital can only accept volunteers who live nearby due to commute limitations). This can also model a type of substitution effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A or B, both belonging to the same meta-type. But some agents specifically want A, and others specifically want B. We propose a new mechanism called Dominant Resource Fairness with Meta Types which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs. The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness, strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem formulation, which improved upon existing work by capturing more constraints that often arise in real life situations. Finally, we show numerically that our method scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. ? 2021 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Other coronaviruses (CoVs) can also infect humans, although the majority cause only mild respiratory symptoms. Because early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for preventing further transmission events and improving clinical outcomes, it is important to be able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other SARS-related CoVs in respiratory samples. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a novel reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the genes encoding the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins to enable the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2, including several new circulating variants and other emerging SARS-like CoVs. By analysis of in vitro-transcribed mRNA, we established multiplex RT-qPCR assays capable of detecting 5  10 copies/reaction. Using RNA extracted from cell culture supernatants, our multiple simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 assays had a limit of detection of 1  10 TCID(50)/mL and showed no cross-reaction with human CoVs or other respiratory viruses. We also validated our method using human clinical samples from patients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals, including nasal swab and sputum samples. This novel one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay can be used to improve the laboratory diagnosis of human-pathogenic CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and may be useful for the identification of other SARS-like CoVs of zoonotic origin.

Additionally, it seems inevitable that this technical resource is here to stay at health centers. However, there is still very little scholarly literature published on this topic, and therefore, the impact of the changes that have had to be dealt with in this regard has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the differences in the establishment of the therapeutic alliance (TA) based on the intervention modality (online or face-to-face), the type of attachment, and diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 291 subjects participated in the study, 149 (51.2%) of whom were men and 142 were (48.8%) women between the ages of 18 and 30 years. The instruments used were sociodemographic data, SOFTA-o (System for Observing Family Therapeutic Alliancesobservational), and Relationship Questionnaire. RESULTS: The results show that the treatments conducted face-to-face obtain significantly better scores in the creation of the TA than those conducted online (t=C42.045, df=289, P<.001). The same holds true with attachment, in that users with secure attachment show a better TA than those with insecure attachment (t=6.068, P<.001,), although there were no significant differences with the diagnosis (F=4.566, P=.44), age (r=0.02, P=.70), and sex (t=0.217, P=.33).
