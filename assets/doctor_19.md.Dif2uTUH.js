However, it is unclear whether the interplay among corresponding genes also plays a role in human health and lifespan. METHODS: Literature about roles of cellular stressors have been reviewed, such as amino acid deprivation, and the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in health and aging. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two candidate genes (GCN2/EIF2AK4 and CHOP/DDIT3) that are closely involved in the cellular stress response to amino acid starvation, have been selected using information from experimental studies. Associations of these SNPs and their interactions with human survival in the Health and Retirement Study data have been estimated. The impact of collective associations of multiple interacting SNP pairs on survival has been evaluated, using a recently developed composite index: the SNP-specific Interaction Polygenic Risk Score (SIPRS). RESULTS: Significant interactions have been found between SNPs from GCN2/EIF2AK4 and CHOP/DDI3T genes that were associated with survival 85+ compared to survival between ages 75 and 85 in the total sample (males and females combined) and in females only. This may reflect sex differences in genetic regulation of the human lifespan. Highly statistically significant associations of SIPRS [constructed for the rs16970024 (GCN2/EIF2AK4) and rs697221 (CHOP/DDIT3)] with survival in both sexes also been found in this study. CONCLUSION: Identifying associations of the genetic interactions with human survival is an important step in translating the knowledge from experimental to human aging research. Significant associations of multiple SNPxSNP interactions in ISR genes with survival to the oldest old age that have been found in this study, can help uncover mechanisms of multifactorial regulation of human lifespan and its heterogeneity.","output":"Roles of interacting stress-related genes in lifespan regulation: insights for translating experimental findings to humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study aimed to describe the presentation and outcomes of horses with signs of colic (abdominal pain) seen 'out-of-hours' in equine practice. METHODS This was a retrospective study of horses seen 'out-of-hours' with colic by two equine veterinary practices between 2011 and 2013. Case outcomes were categorised as 'critical' or 'not critical'. A critical outcome was defined as requiring medical or surgical hospital treatment, or resulting in euthanasia or death. A non-critical outcome was defined as resolving with simple medical treatment. A hierarchical generalised linear model was used to identify 'red flag' parameters (aspects of signalment, history and presenting clinical signs) associated with critical outcomes. RESULTS Data were retrieved from 941 cases that presented with colic; 23.9 per cent (n=225/941) were critical. Variables significantly associated with the likelihood of a critical outcome in the final multivariable model were increased heart rate (P<0.001), age of the horse (P=0.013) and abnormal mucous membrane colour (P<0.001). Overall 18 per cent (n=168/941) of cases were euthanased. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the mortality associated with colic.

However, it is unclear whether effects would hold in daily life during COVID-19, when people may have difficulty seeing a path towards their life goals. DESIGN: The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS: Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people.

Furthermore, some researchers have studied the link between daily fatality rates with regional factors such as health resources, but found no significant factors.

First, we characterize regional spreading patterns of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by a special patterned Poisson regression model for longitudinal count; the varying growth and declining patterns as well as turning points among regions in Italy have been well captured by regional regression parameters.

To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths. As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3). Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death.

Evidence of health care needs in disasters increasingly suggests benefits from greater involvement of GPs, and recent research has clarified key roles. Despite this, GPs continue to be disconnected from disaster health management (DHM) in most countries. STUDY OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of disaster management professionals in two countries, across a range of all-hazard disasters, regarding the roles and contributions of GPs to DHM, and to identify barriers to, and benefits of, more active engagement of GPs in disaster health care systems. METHODS A qualitative research methodology using semi-structured interviews was conducted with a purposive sample of Disaster Managers (DMs) to explore their perspectives arising from experiences and observations of GPs during disasters from 2009 through 2016 in Australia or New Zealand. These involved all-hazard disasters including natural, man-made, and pandemic disasters. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS These findings document support from DM participants for greater integration of GPs into DHM with New Zealand DMs reporting GPs as already a valuable integrated contributor. In contrast, Australian DMs reported barriers to inclusion that needed to be addressed before sustained integration could occur. The two most strongly expressed barriers were universally expressed by Australian DMs: (1) limited understanding of the work GPs undertake, restricting DMs' ability to facilitate GP integration; and (2) DMs' difficulty engaging with GPs as a single group. Other considerations included GPs' limited DHM knowledge, limited preparedness, and their heightened vulnerability.Strategies identified to facilitate greater integration of GPs into DHM where it is lacking, such as Australia, included enhanced communication, awareness, and understanding between GPs and DMs. CONCLUSION Experience from New Zealand shows systematic, sustained integration of GPs into DHM systems is achievable and valuable. Findings suggest key factors are collaboration between DMs and GPs at local, state, and national levels of DHM in planning and preparedness for the next disaster.

They are also complex by their internal structure, management and deployed modern technologies. This complexity is not always well understood, and cannot be efficiently controlled. As the complexity and interdependencies increase, man-made systems become more unstable creating conditions for cascading, system-level failures causing serious threats to both themselves and society in general. Such breakdowns may consist of a) serious physical damages and destruction of their physical assets (caused by natural disasters, extreme weather phenomena and climate change, malicious human actions, etc.), and/or b) large functional disruptions with no physical damages of assets (caused by major organizations internal disturbances, market crashes, pandemics, disruptions of supply chains, etc.). Those sources of risks are basically external to organizations. They are unable to control them, but are deeply affected by those risks.

Based on complexity thinking and curriculum design with digital resources, I propose the concept of connectivity as a crucial principle for creating coherent curriculum trajectories.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors among COVID-19 patients based on the Framingham risk score (FRS), and to evaluate the association of CVD risk factors with clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we identified 264 confirmed cases with COVID-19 at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients aged 18-80 years were included, and their electronic records were reviewed. They were classified into low, intermediate, and high risk of CVD according to FRS classification. Results: Two-hundred-six patients (67% male) were included in this study. The mean age was 55.3  15.1 years. Most patients had comorbidities: the most common were hypertension (48.1%), diabetes (45.1%), and ischemic heart disease (11.2%). More than half required intensive care admission, and 58 (28.2%) patients died. Pneumonia was the most frequently observed complication (85%), followed by mechanical ventilation (28.3%) and acute kidney injury (27.7%). Age, male gender, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus showed significant differences between FRS categories, and were associated with intermediate and high-risk groups of FRS (p < 0.05).

Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.","output":"Strategies for Designing Transgenic DNA Constructs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A compulsory school entrance examination of pre-school children (SEU) is administered in the German state of Bavaria. Every second year since 2004, the examinations are expanded in six study regions using a cross-sectional survey design (GME). However, the extent to which the results of the GME surveys are generalizable to the SEU population is unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a poststratification of two different GME surveys. The aim was to observe the impact of poststratification on an exemplary analysis of influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma, wheezing) and thus to better understand this important question. METHODS First, poststratification was applied to correct for deviances of the GME sample in comparison to the SEU population. Logistic regression was used to determine the auxiliary variables for the poststratification. Following this, a composite variable as a linear combination was created to calculate weighting factors. Next, logistic regression analyses were applied to analyze possible influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma and wheezing) in two GME surveys (2005/2006 and 2012/2013). Subsequently, the differences arising from poststratification were examined in more detail. RESULTS This study supports the hypothesis that the GME sample deviates from the SEU population. Mother tongue other than German of at least one parent, complete vaccination status and conspicuous visuomotor test results were positively associated with participation in both GME surveys. The prevalence for hay fever, asthma and frequent wheeze did not change statistically significant from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013. In the twelve analyses before and after poststratification, male sex was statistically significant associated with the three allergy and asthma related outcomes (e.g. asthma 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 2.06, 95%-CI: 1.56-2.71). A high body mass index was positively associated with asthma (e.g. 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 1.12, 95%-CI: 1.05-1.20). Poststratification caused a significant change in the sample composition. CONCLUSIONS It might be suggested that a poststratification should be performed for each GME survey. Poststratification tended to make results more comparable with previous research. In accordance with previous research, this study confirmed that male sex and high BMI are associated with asthma.","output":"Poststratification as a suitable approach to generalize findings of two cross-sectional studies along the Bavarian compulsory school entrance examination: An exemplary poststratified analysis for asthma, hay fever and wheezing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le neuro-Covid dsigne l'ensemble des atteintes du systme nerveux associes  l'infection par Sars-CoV-2, et regroupe des entits varies.

METHODS: Prospective observational study, including both attendees of the French Intensive Care Society (FICS) annual meeting held in Paris between June the 9th and June the 11th, 2021 and matched controls (healthcare professionals who stayed in the ICU during the conference). SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow test was performed on day 7. Follow-up occurred until day 21. RESULTS: Out of the 1824 healthcare professionals attending the congress (all of which fulfilled legal requirements: 7 days or more following a second dose of vaccine or a negative PCR test performed within less than 72 h), 520 (28.5%) agreed to participate. Follow-up data were received for 216 (41.5%) out of the 520 included attendees, and for 191 matched controls. No positive SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow test was reported in the attendees or in the matched controls. The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the MGE was less than 1.7% in the attendees (95% confidence interval [0;1.7%]), less than 2% in the controls (95%CI [0;2%]) and the difference in probabilities of infection was less than 1.9% (95% CI [0;1.9%]). CONCLUSION: During a low incidence period, in this population of congress attendees screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a lateral flow test at day 7, no positive cases could be documented, no concomitant infection occurred in the matched controls; suggesting no extra risk of infection during the MGE.

French independent midwives perform about half of the early prenatal interviews that identify mothers' needs during pregnancy and then refer them to the appropriate resources. The French government, however, structured the COVID-19 pandemic response around public health institutions and did not directly mobilise these community healthcare workers during the lockdown phase. These responses have raised questions about their role within the healthcare system in crises. This surveys main objectives were to estimate the proportion of independent midwives who experienced new difficulties in referring women to healthcare facilities or other caregivers and in collaborating with hospitals during the first stage of this pandemic. The secondary objective was to estimate the proportion, according to their mode of practice, of independent midwives who considered that all the women under their care had risked harm due to failed or delayed referral to care. Methods: We conducted an online national survey addressed to independent midwives in France from 29 April to 15 May 2020, around the end of the first lockdown (17 MarchC11 May, 2020). Results: Of the 5264 registered independent midwives in France, 1491 (28.3%) responded;64.7% reported new or greater problems during the pandemic in referring women to health facilities or care-providers, social workers in particular, and 71.0% reported new difficulties collaborating with hospitals. Nearly half (46.2%) the respondents considered that all the women in their care had experienced, to varying degrees, a lack of or delay in care that could have affected their health. This proportion did not differ according to the midwives form of practice: solo practice, group practice with other midwives only, or group practice with at least two types of healthcare professionals. Conclusions: The pandemic has degraded the quality of pregnant womens care in France and challenged the French model of care, which is highly compartmentalised between an almost exclusively independent primary care (community) sector and a predominantly salaried secondary care (hospital) sector.","output":"The challenge of care coordination by midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national descriptive survey (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute peristome edema disease (APED) is a new disease that broke out in cultured sea cucumber along the Shangdong and Liaoning province coasts in China, PR, and has caused a great deal of death in Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka) since 2004.

This has affected the epidemiological behaviour of various pathologies. We analyze the impact of the pandemic on the number of admissions due to stroke, its severity and mortality in Santiago, Chile. Methods: a multicenter observational study based on the records of the 3 hospitals of the South East health service in Santiago, Chile. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 01 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. We grouped the cases into two periods, pre-pandemic and pandemic, according to the setting of the state of emergency in Chile. Results: 431 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke during the study period. There was a non-significant decrease in weekly admissions (17 vs 15 patients per week). No differences were observed in the proportion of patients with medical treatment (p = 0.810), IVT (p = 0.638), EVT (p = 0.503) or IVT + EVT (p = 0.501). There was a statistically significant increase in the NIHSS on admission (7.23 vs 8.78, p = 0.009) and mortality (5.2% vs 12.4%, p = 0.012). In a multivariate analysis the NIHSS on admission was associated with the increased mortality (RR 1.11, CI 1.04-1.19, p = 0.003). Conclusion: We found an increase in the severity of ischemic stroke on admission and in-hospital mortality during the pandemic period.

Established triage standards and guidelines may not contain the most appropriate severity assessment and outcome prediction models. Objectives Develop a draft pandemic specific triage assessment score for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Design a website where initial Toward a COVID-19 Scores (TACS) can be quickly calculated and used to compare various treatment strategies. Create a TACS Registry where data and outcomes for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients can be recorded. Use the TACS Registry to develop an influenza epidemic specific database and score for use in future respiratory based epidemics. Design, Setting, Participants Retrospective analysis of 3,301 ICU admissions with respiratory failure admitted to 41 U.S. Intensive Care Units from 2015-19. Independent external validation on 1,175 similar ICU Admissions using identical entry criteria from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH), Washington University from 2016-2019. Main Outcomes TACS was created with 16 readily available predictive variables for risk assessment of hospital mortality 24 hours after ICU Admission and the need for prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation (PAMV) ( >>96 hours) at 24- and 48-hours post ICU admission. Results TACS achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for hospital mortality after 24 hours of 0.80 in the development dataset; 0.81 in the internal validation dataset. At a probability of 50% hospital mortality, positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.55, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.89; sensitivity 22%, specificity 97%. For PAMV after 24 hours, the AUC was 0.84 in the development dataset, 0.81 in the validation dataset. For PAMV after 48 hours, the AUC was 0.82 in the development dataset, 0.78 in the validation dataset. In the external validation the AUC for TACS was 0.76 +/- 0.024. We launched a website that is scaled for mobile device use ( https://covid19score.azurewebsites.net/) that provides open access to a user-friendly TACS Calculator for all predictions. We also designed a voluntary TACS Registry for collection of data and outcomes on ICU Admissions with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Toward a COVID-19 score is a starting point for an epidemic specific triage assessment that could be used to evaluate various approaches to treatment.

An online survey was developed to elicit information on (1) the role of medical students in the pandemic era; (2) Medical education in the new normal, and (3) the impact of COVID-19 on medical students. Methods: The online survey, developed by a team consisting of three medical students, three psychiatry residents, and three professors of psychiatry, was conducted on 574 participants (213 medical students, 180 graduates, and 181 professors) in the University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Anxiety symptom rating scales, including the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 (SAVE-6) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder?7 (GAD-7) scale, were applied to measure participant anxiety level. Results: Medical students indicated their willingness to join the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic, if requested; however, graduates and professors recommended that medical students continue their training rather than join the pandemic healthcare response. In the new normal era, medical education has had to change appropriately. Moreover, adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection and spread must be considered for the continuation of clinical clerkships during the pandemic. Overall, medical students who indicated anxiety about treating possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 rated higher on the SAVE-6 scale. Finally, medical students who reported that COVID-19 had an impact on their studies and daily life rated higher on the general anxiety scale (GAD-7). Conclusion: Social accountability is an important issue for medical students in the pandemic era. At the same time, non-disruption of their academic calendar would ensure continuous availability of component medical professionals, which is important for adequate future healthcare responses.","output":"Attitude of Medical Students About Their Role and Social Accountability in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We established an inducible Kras(G12D)-driven lung adenocarcinoma in CCSP-rtTA/TetO-Cre/LSL-Kras(G12D) mice that enable pursuits of the cellular and molecular processes involved in Kras-induced tumorigenesis. To investigate the cellular origin of this cancer, we first report a strategy using fluorescence-activated cell sorting fractionation that could highly enrich bronchiolar Clara and alveolar type II cells, respectively. The EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells (bronchiolar origin) were more enriched with tumorigenic cells in generating secondary tumors than EpCAM(+)MHCII(+) cells (alveolar origin) in primary tumors that had been already initiated with oncogenic Kras activation. In addition, secondary tumors derived from EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells showed diversity of tumor locations compared with those derived from EpCAM(+)MHCII(+) cells. In the alveolar region, secondary tumors from EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells expressed not only bronchiolar epithelial marker, panCK, but also differentiation marker, proSPC, consistent with the notion that cancer-initiating cells display not only the abilities for self-renewal but also the features of differentiation to generate heterogeneous tumors with phenotypic diversity. Furthermore, high level of ERK1/2 activation and colony-forming ability as well as lack of Sprouty-2 expression were also observed in EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells.

METHODS: Two online surveys were conducted in New Zealand over the level 4 lockdown in April 2020 measuring psychological distress, anxiety, well-being, suicidality, alcohol use and subjective experiences. They included 3389 participants, of whom 18.4% reported having been previously diagnosed with a mental illness. RESULTS: During the lockdown, people previously diagnosed with a mental illness had about twice the risk of reporting moderate-high levels of psychological distress (K10 a 12), at least moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7 a 10) and poor well-being (WHO-5 a 12). They reported increased alcohol use and were about four times as likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts with 3% reporting having made a suicide attempt over the lockdown period. They reported less satisfaction with, and poorer relationships with people in their 'bubble', reduced social contacts and greater loneliness. They also reported higher levels of health and financial concerns.

The results demonstrated that all derivatives inhibited SKOV3 cell growth, and Compound 3 showed the most outstanding anti-proliferative effect on SKOV3 cells. The IC50 value of Compound 3 was 33.8  2.21 M, less than half of that of cis-platinum (70.1  7.64 M). Subsequent analysis revealed that Compound 3 could promote SKOV3 cell apoptosis, and the percentage of apoptotic cell population increased with increasing Compound 3 concentrations. In addition, the expression ratios of Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved-Caspase-3/Caspase-3 and cleaved-Caspase-9/Caspase-9 were gradually elevated in Compound 3-treated SKOV3 cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, translocation of Bax to mitochondria was associated with the release of Cytochrome C. Molecular docking analysis revealed three hydrogen-bonds existed in Compound 3 with PARP receptor (PDB code: 5DSY), which may be the target of the anti-ovarian cancer effect of Compound 3.

METHODS: We conducted a macro-analysis to determine the presence of relationship between GHS index (GHSI) and UHC index (UHCI). We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 with a 95% level of confidence. FINDINGS: There is a moderate and significant relationship between GHSI and UHCI (r = 0.662, p<0.001) and individual indices of UHCI (maternal and child health and infectious diseases: r = 0.623 (p<0.001) and 0.594 (p<0.001), respectively). However, there is no relationship between GHSI and the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) index (r = 0.063, p>0.05).

In this work, we elucidate this aspect of virus replication using Baculovirus as an example system and both experimental and modeling studies. The existing mathematical models for the virus replication process consider DIPs as a lumped quantity and do not consider the genome length distribution of the DIPs. In this study, a detailed population balance model for the cell-virus culture is presented, which predicts the genome length distribution of the DIP population along with their relative proportion. The model is simulated using the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, and the results agree well with the experimental results.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to reduce the number of inappropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) requests for LBP patients and facilitate appropriate imaging by developing a combined imaging appropriateness checklist for lumbar spine MRI and CT. METHODS: In prior work, we developed and adopted individual evidence-based lumbar spine MRI and CT checklists into the radiology requisition process. In the current project, a combined checklist was developed and trialed in one of the former Saskatchewan health regions (Five Hills) beginning in May 2018. Using statistical process control, control charts compared the monthly number of imaging requests pre-checklist implementation and post-checklist implementation from May 2017 to February 2020. The monthly number of lumbar spine MRI and CT requisitions in the nearby former Saskatchewan Regina QuAppelle Health Region, in which the combined checklist was not trialed, was also plotted and compared as a balancing measure. RESULTS: In Five Hills, a shift (decrease) was observed in the monthly number of lumbar spine MRI requisitions 7 months following the implementation of the combined checklist. However, the monthly number of lumbar spine CT requisitions did not change significantly. In the Regina QuAppelle Health Region, there was a shift (increase) in the monthly number of lumbar spine MRI requisitions, while the monthly number of lumbar spine CT requests decreased after the implementation of the combined checklist. CONCLUSIONS: The combined checklist with evidence-based indications for lumbar spine MRI and CT imaging in LBP patients appeared to reduce the complexity associated with two previous individual checklists and facilitate imaging appropriateness. Accountable benefits may include the reduction of radiation exposure as a result of unnecessary and repeated imaging and reduction in wait times for CT and/or MRI.","output":"Combined lumbar spine MRI and CT appropriateness checklist: a quality improvement project in Saskatchewan, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aspirations to slow down the spread of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) resulted in unprecedented restrictions on personal and work-related travels in various nations across the globe.

As restrictions loosen and cities start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to transit-time related risks.","output":"A Quantitative Framework for Establishing Low-risk Interdistrict Travel Corridors during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Residency programs invest a significant amount of time and resources on the recruitment process, and maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness are very important. Virtual Reality (VR) has become an adaptive substitute for real life experiences and its use during the interview season could help save time and resources. OBJECTIVE: With the intention to maximize the interview day and provide a cost-effective alternative to facility tours, a Med-Peds residency training program introduced a VR tour of their childrens hospital during recruitment. DESIGN: The Med-Peds program replaced an in-person facility tour of the childrens hospital with a VR tour. Applicants were asked to complete an anonymous, voluntary survey on their VR experience at the end of the interview season, and rank features of the interview day in order of importance. RESULTS: There were 33 respondents out of 54 interviewees. Approximately two thirds (63C66%) agreed that VR was non-inferior and superior to in-person facility tours, and that the use of VR had a favorable impact on their perception of the program. However, almost 50% of the applicants had some difficulty using VR technology. CONCLUSION: Use of VR facility tours as an alternative to in-person tours of affiliate training facilities during a residency interview day is a viable and innovative option that can save time and money and favorably impact the applicants impression of the program. More research is necessary to assess whether VR tours can replace in-person tours at the main teaching site, however, while social distancing measures are in place, VR tours may become necessary for programs moving forward.

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities.

We present the marked discordance around digital mental health policy, as these frameworks grapple with the challenges of regulating in this sphere. RESULTS: Across the world, there is no consensus around evaluation with countries piloting or proposing different models. Common barriers include the defining the scope and risk of health apps, creating processes able to update evaluation with software updates, lacking better data to inform evaluation, and educating users to the risks and benefits.

The evidence on short-term compared with long-term mentalisation-based therapy is currently unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: The Short-Term MBT Project (MBT-RCT) is a single-centre, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, randomised clinical superiority trial in which short-term (20 weeks) will be compared with long-term (14 months) mentalisation-based therapy for outpatients with subthreshold or diagnosed borderline personality disorder. Outcome assessors, data managers, the data safety and monitoring committee, statisticians, and decision-makers will be blinded to treatment allocation. Participants will be assessed before randomisation and at 8, 16, and 24 months after randomisation. The primary outcome will be the severity of borderline symptomatology assessed with the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder. Secondary outcomes will be functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey 36mental component), global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning), and proportion of participants with severe self-harm.

Additionally, virus Spike protein is found to evoke LTA4H and fibrinogen expression in vivo. Collectively, these findings identify the imbalance between inflammatory drivers and antagonists, which likely contributes to hypercytokinemia in COVID-19.

For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein, binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found that CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs.

Cancer patients are considered a vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may develop several COVID-19 symptoms. The heightened immunocompromised state, prolonged chronic pro-inflammatory milieu coupled with comorbid conditions are shared in both disease conditions and may influence patient outcome. Although ovarian cancer (OC) and COVID-19 are diseases of entirely different primary organs, both diseases share similar molecular and cellular characteristics in their microenvironment suggesting a potential cooperativity leading to poor outcome.

The women at the age of 50-60 years are at greater risk of developing OC as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased levels of gonadotropin and androgen, dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), hyper-coagulation and chronic inflammation are common conditions observed among OC and severe cases of COVID-19.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in consecutive women presenting to the general surgery clinic between May 2020 and December 2020. Patients diagnosed with NCBP formed one group for study and 44 receiving routine well-woman care formed the control group. Evaluations were undertaken using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Of 160 consecutive patients, 116 were diagnosed with NCBP and 44 controls. Poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) was present in 59% (n = 69) of the women with NCBP and 38% (n = 17) of the controls (p = 0.018).

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting binding sites, while single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS-promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.","output":"Role of spatial patterning of N-protein interactions in SARS-CoV-2 genome packaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, evolved into a pandemic which is still going on.

METHODS: In a retrospective study based on a U.S. national registry, we determined the antiCSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in convalescent plasma used to treat hospitalized adults with Covid-19. The primary outcome was death within 30 days after plasma transfusion. Patients who were enrolled through July 4, 2020, and for whom data on antiCSARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma transfusions and on 30-day mortality were available were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 3082 patients included in this analysis, death within 30 days after plasma transfusion occurred in 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group.

These two modalities have been previously only studied on their own or in conjunction with the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the purpose of estimating PTT. We measure the PTT from the wrist to the finger using Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and compare it to the conventional PTT measured from the ECG to PPG at the finger, in order to prove that it can be an effective replacement for existing PTT measurement strategies. Moreover, successful measurement of PTT with two different modalities of sensors at close proximity will allow designs with multiple heterogeneous sensors on a more versatile wearable sensing platform that is optimized for power and is more robust to environmental or skin contact changes. This will enable the next generation of smart watches that capture PTT and BP. Experiments were conducted in vivo with simultaneous ECG, Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and results indicate that the PTT calculated from the Bio-Z and PPG sensors placed at a close distance correlates well with the more established PTT measurement using the ECG in conjunction with PPG, with correlation coefficient as high as 0.92.","output":"Exploration and validation of alternate sensing methods for wearable continuous pulse transit time measurement using optical and bioimpedance modalities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, results of several pertinent studies in the field of breast cancer (BC) were presented in a virtual format at the 2020 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. Early results of the MonarchE trial investigating the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy indicated a lower recurrence rate in the combination group in a high-risk population of patients with early stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative BC. In contrast, the PALLAS study evaluating adjuvant palbociclib could not confirm these results. Subtle differences in the respective trial populations, a higher discontinuation rate in PALLAS, or substance-specific differences may be responsible. In HER2-positive early stage BC, long-term results of the ADAPT-TP trial support the notion that chemotherapy-free treatment may be possible in a subset of patients with favourable response to HER2-directed therapy without compromising long-term outcome. The phase III IMpassion031 trial evaluated the addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy in triple-negative BC (TNBC). A significant improvement in terms of pathologic complete remission rate was observed but data concerning long-term outcome must be awaited. Final overall survival (OS) analysis of IMpassion130 confirmed the clinically relevant OS improvement observed with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. In contrast, no benefit was observed with the addition of atezolizumab to solvent-based paclitaxel in a similar population. This contradiction is commonly explained by the need for corticosteroid co-medication with conventional paclitaxel, but the exact reason remains poorly understood. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been successfully established in HER2-positive breast cancer; in TNBC, the phase III ASCENT trial compared the ADC sacituzumab govitecan with chemotherapy by physician's choice in pretreated metastatic patients. A significant improvement in terms of progression-free survival and OS was observed rendering this drug a potential novel standard in this patient population.","output":"ESMO 2020: highlights in breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 has shown to entail an increased risk of thrombotic, especially venous, events. Central venous catheters have also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical embolism due to intra- or extra-cardiac shunt should be considered in patients with COVID-19, given the high associated risk of venous thromboembolism. Further studies are needed to be able to define optimal prophylactic and therapeutic management.","output":"Complicacin trombtica de neumona grave por COVID-19: ictus por embolismo paradjico atpico./ [Thrombotic complication of severe COVID-19 pneumonia: stroke due to atypical paradoxical embolism]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health emergency. Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent condition and the dominant role antibiotics play in its treatment is a major concern. Antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of acne predominantly for their anti-inflammatory effect, hence their use in acne may not be optimal. Tetracyclines and macrolides are the two most common oral antibiotic classes prescribed, and their average use can extend from a few months to several years of intermittent or continuous use. The overall aim of this systematic review is to elucidate what is known about oral antibiotics for acne contributing to antibiotic treatment failure and AMR. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review will be conducted to address the question: What is the existing evidence that long-term oral antibiotics used to treat acne in those over 8 years of age contribute towards antibiotic treatment failure or other outcomes suggestive of the impact of AMR? We will search the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Search terms will be developed in collaboration with a librarian by identifying keywords from relevant articles and by undertaking pilot searches. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-controlled studies conducted in any healthcare setting and published in any language will be included. The searches will be re-run prior to final analyses to capture the recent literature. The Cochrane tool for bias assessment in randomised trials and ROBINS-I for the assessment of bias in non-randomised studies will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. GRADE will be used to make an overall assessment of the quality of evidence. A meta-analysis will be undertaken of the outcome measures if the individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous. If a meta-analysis is not possible, a qualitative assessment will be presented as a narrative review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this systematic-review.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of local estrogen therapy in this setting. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of local estradiol in primiparous women with a second-degree or greater perineal laceration following a term vaginal delivery. Participants were randomized to twice weekly estradiol or placebo cream from delivery through 3 months postpartum. The primary outcome was a validated measure of vulvovaginal symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes included measures of perineal pain, quality of life, sexual function, ease of use, likelihood of continued use, and adverse events. RESULTS: We planned to enroll 70 women; however, due to human subjects research restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was stopped early. A total of 59 women were randomized, 31 to the estradiol group and 28 to the placebo group. Nearly all participants (95%) were followed through 12 weeks with suggestion of marginal improvement in Vulvar Assessment Scale scores [-0.10; 90% CI = (-0.20, 0.01)] in those randomized to estradiol compared to placebo. Local estradiol was not associated with improvement in other measures, and only one non-serious adverse event was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In primiparous women with a perineal laceration, use of local estradiol showed minimal clinical benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy and related symptoms but appears to be acceptable and safe for postpartum use. Larger adequately powered trials enrolling a diverse group of postpartum women are needed to affirm these findings.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19-related public health measures on orthopaedic presentations to a regional Australian hospital. METHODS: A case-control study was performed at a regional trauma hospital in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data was collected prospectively from patients that required orthopaedic review in the period corresponding to a declaration of a global pandemic to the end of the NSW lockdown, and compared with retrospective data from the corresponding period in 2019. The five-year average of orthopaedic presentations to ED during the study period were obtained for comparison. The primary outcomes were overall number of presentations, mechanism and anatomical location of injuries, operative versus non-operative management and disposition. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, presentations requiring orthopaedic review were significantly more frequent than 2019 (496 vs. 280, p < 0.0001), with more requiring admission in 2020 (p < 0.0001). The absolute number of patients managed operatively was higher (p = 0.0002) and significantly more patients were referred for community follow-up (p < 0.0001). There was a 20% increase of consults in 2020 compared to the average number of referrals during the same period in the previous five years.

However, low rates of compliance amongst healthcare workers have been reported globally. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further emphasized the need for global improvement in hand hygiene compliance by healthcare workers. AIM: This comprehensive systematic review provides an up-to-date compilation of clinical trials, reported between 2014 and 2020, assessing hand hygiene interventions in order to inform healthcare leaders and practitioners regarding approaches to reduce healthcare-associated infections using hand hygiene. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase, Medline, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials published between March 2014 and December 2020 on the topic of hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers. In total, 332 papers were identified from these searches, of which 57 studies met the inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Forty-five of the 57 studies (79%) included in this review were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA. The large majority of these clinical trials were conducted in acute care facilities, including hospital wards and intensive care facilities. Nurses represented the largest group of healthcare workers studied (44 studies, 77%), followed by physicians (41 studies, 72%). Thirty-six studies (63%) adopted the World Health Organization's multi-modal framework or a variation of this framework, and many of them recorded hand hygiene opportunities at each of the 'Five Moments'. However, recording of hand hygiene technique was not common.

METHODS: This prospective observational study includes patients with AIS who underwent CT imaging within 4.5 h of the onset of symptoms. Patients were divided into the NIHSSCASPECTS mismatch (NAM)-positive and NAM-negative groups (group P and N, respectively). The clinical outcome was assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Safety outcomes included progression, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), adverse events, clinical adverse events, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were enrolled in the study. In group P, IVT treatment was associated with a good functional outcome at 3 months (p = 0.005) and 1 year (p = 0.001). A higher percentage of patients with favorable mRS (0C2) (p = 0.01) and excellent mRS (0C1) (p = 0.011) functional outcomes was obtained at 1 year in group P with IVT treatment. Group N did not benefit from the same treatment (p = 0.352 and p = 0.480 at 3 months and 1 year, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in sICH, ICH, mortality rates, or other risks between the IVT and conventional treatment groups. CONCLUSION: IVT treatment is associated with a good functional outcome in patients with NAM, without increasing the risks of sICH, ICH, mortality, or other negative outcomes.

The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic transformed health care in the United States to include a telehealth model of care delivery. Clarifying paths through which telehealth technology use is associated with change in provider well-being and interest in sustaining virtual care delivery can inform planning and optimization efforts. Objective This study aimed to characterize provider-reported changes in well-being and daily work associated with the pandemic-accelerated expansion of telehealth and assess the relationship of provider perceptions of telehealth effectiveness, efficiency, and workClife balance with desire for future telehealth. Methods A cross-sectional survey study was conducted October through November 2020, 6 months after the outbreak of COVID-19 at three children's hospitals. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to examine telehealth factors associated with reported change in well-being and desire for future telehealth. Results A total of 947 nontrainee physicians, advanced practice providers, and psychologists were surveyed. Of them, 502 (53.0%) providers responded and 467 (49.3%) met inclusion criteria of telehealth use during the study period. Of these, 325 (69.6%) were female, 301 (65.6%) were physicians, and 220 (47.1%) were medical subspecialists. Providers were 4.77 times as likely (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.29C7.06) to report improved versus worsened well-being associated with telehealth. Also, 95.5% of providers (95% CI: 93.2C97.2%) wish to continue performing telehealth postpandemic. Our model explains 66% of the variance in telehealth-attributed provider well-being and 59% of the variance for future telehealth preference and suggests telehealth resources significantly influence provider-perceived telehealth care effectiveness which in turn significantly influences provider well-being and desire to perform telehealth. Conclusion Telehealth has potential to promote provider well-being; telehealth-related changes in provider well-being are associated with both provider-perceived effectiveness of telemedicine for patients and adequacy of telehealth resources.","output":"Associations of Telehealth Care Delivery with Pediatric Health Care Provider Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, caused respiratory disease outbreaks with increased mortality in 4 mink farms in the Netherlands.

RESULTS: The current results reveal a significant increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress between 2020 and 2021. Positive mental health (PMH), sense of control, and physical health significantly decreased. Depression symptoms (BL), PMH (BL), and consciously enhanced physical activity since the pandemic outbreak (FU) significantly predicted 12-month suicide ideation (FU). In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive relationship between depression and suicide ideation was significantly mediated by PMH. Consciously enhanced physical activity significantly moderated the negative association between PMH and suicide ideation. CONCLUSION: The context of Covid-19 could negatively impact mental health and physical health. This might increase the risk for suicide ideation. However, PMH and physical activity might serve as protective factors.

Many physicians replaced face-to-face consultations with teleconsultations for the very first time. This study aimed to understand telemedicine uses by physicians during the lockdown period and explain the changes in their teleconsultation practices after the reopening of an outpatient department. Methods: A mixed-method analysis was used. First, a quantitative study was conducted with a retrospective analysis of the ratio of all teleconsultations and physical consultations between January 1 and July 31, 2020. Second, semidirective interviews were undertaken with physicians to better understand the dynamics of teleconsultation use. Results: In total, 28 physicians practiced 603 teleconsultations over the study period. The rate of teleconsultations was 0.2% before the lockdown (January 1 to March 15, 2020), reaching 19.5% during the lockdown (April 2020), and decreasing to 8.4% at the reopening of the physical outpatient facilities.

Methods: Weekly online case reporting was distributed to the CPSP network of more than 2800 pediatricians, from March 2020 to May 2021. Comparisons were made between cases with respect to SARS CoV2 linkage. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to identify risk factors for ICU admission and Minimum incidence proportions were calculated. Findings: In total, 406 PIMS cases were analyzed, of whom 202 (49.8%) had a positive SARS CoV2 linkage, 106 (26.1%) had a negative linkage, and 98 (24.1%) had an unknown linkage. The median age was 5.4 years (IQR 2.5 to 9.8), 60% were male, and 83% had no identified comorbidities.

A literature review identified four patients with CADM and MDA-5 antibodies treated with TPE; all experienced symptomatic improvement of their ILD. We attribute our patient's outcome to the advanced nature of his disease rather than a failure of TPE. Additional research may indicate a possible reclassification of CADM with MDA-5 antibodies in future ASFA guidelines.","output":"The role of therapeutic plasma exchange in clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with MDA-5 antibody: A case report and review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review presents the results of a study into the offering of rapid microbial detection assays to the Irish dairy industry At the outset, a consultation process was undertaken whereby key stakeholders were asked to compile a list of the key microorganisms of interest to the sector The resultant list comprises 19 organisms/groups of organisms divided into five categories: single pathogenic species (Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes);genera containing pathogenic species (Bacillus, Clostridium, Listeria, Salmonella;Staphylococcus);broad taxonomic groupings (Coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, fecal Streptococci, sulfite reducing bacteria/sulfite reducing Clostridia [SRBs/SRCs], yeasts and molds);organisms displaying certain growth preferences or resistance as regards temperature (endospores, psychrotrophs, thermodurics, thermophiles);indicators of quality (total plate count, Pseudomonas spp ) A survey of the rapid assays commercially available for the 19 organisms/groups of organisms was conducted A wide disparity between the number of rapid tests available was found Four categories were used to summarize the availability of rapid assays per organism/group of organisms: high coverage (&gt;15 assays available);medium coverage (5C15 assays available);low coverage (&lt;5 assays available);no coverage (0 assays available) Generally, species or genera containing pathogens, whose presence is regulated-for, tend to have a good selection of commercially available rapid assays for their detection, whereas groups composed of heterogenous or even undefined genera of mainly spoilage organisms tend to be low coverage or no coverage  Organisms/groups of organisms with low coverage by rapid assays include: Clostridium spp ;fecal Streptococci;and Pseudomonas spp Those with no coverage by rapid assays include: endospores;psychrotrophs;SRB/SRCs;thermodurics;and thermophiles An important question is: why have manufacturers of rapid microbiological assays failed to respond to the necessity for rapid methods for these organisms/groups of organisms? The review offers explanations, ranging from the technical difficulty involved in detecting as broad a group as the thermodurics, which covers the spores of multiple sporeforming genera as well at least six genera of mesophilic nonsporeformers, to the taxonomically controversial issue as to what constitutes a fecal Streptococcus or SRBs/SRCs We review two problematic areas for assay developers: validation/certification and the nature of dairy food matrices Development and implementation of rapid alternative test methods for the dairy industry is influenced by regulations relating to both the microbiological quality standards and the criteria alternative methods must meet to qualify as acceptable test methods However, the gap between the certification of developer's test systems as valid alternative methods in only a handful of representative matrices, and the requirement of dairy industries to verify the performance of alternative test systems in an extensive and diverse range of dairy matrices needs to be bridged before alternative methods can be widely accepted and adopted in the dairy industry This study concludes that many important dairy matrices have effectively been ignored by assay developers","output":"Gaps in the assortment of rapid assays for microorganisms of interest to the dairy industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and COVID-19 related complications.

Physical activity is especially important for chronically ill individuals. In the Netherlands, older Surinamese individuals are more likely to have chronic diseases than are their native Dutch counterparts. This study examined relationships of neighbourhood characteristics with physical activity among older Surinamese individuals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. METHODS: Of 2749 potential participants, 697 (25%) community-dwelling older (age  70 years) Surinamese individuals living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, completed a questionnaire on personal and neighbourhood characteristics between March and June 2020. Correlation and multilevel regression analyses were performed to identify associations between missing neighbourhood characteristics for ageing in place and physical activity. RESULTS: Scores for the neighbourhood domains communication and information (r = -0.099, p  0.05), community support and health services (r = -0.139, p  0.001), and respect and social inclusion (r = -0.141, p  0.001), correlated negatively with participants PA. In the multilevel analysis, overall missing neighbourhood characteristics to age in place scores were associated negatively with physical activity (p  0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed the importance of age-friendly neighbourhoods for physical activity among older Surinamese individuals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Our findings suggest that the neighbourhood plays an important role in supporting older individuals leading of physically active lifestyles.

A review of key developments and uses, with an assessment of strengths/limitations in various clinical workflows, was completed. Aim: Our review studies how smartphone-based imaging (SBI) systems are designed and tested for specialized applications in medicine and healthcare. An evaluation of current research studies is used to provide guidelines for improving the impact of these research advances. Approach: First, the established and emerging smartphone capabilities that can be leveraged for biomedical imaging are detailed. Then, methods and materials for fabrication of optical, mechanical, and electrical interface components are summarized. Recent systems were categorized into four groups based on their intended application and clinical workflow: ex vivo diagnostic, in vivo diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment guidance. Lastly, strengths and limitations of current SBI systems within these various applications are discussed. Results: The native smartphone capabilities for biomedical imaging applications include cameras, touchscreens, networking, computation, 3D sensing, audio, and motion, in addition to commercial wearable peripheral devices. Through user-centered design of custom hardware and software interfaces, these capabilities have the potential to enable portable, easy-to-use, point-of-care biomedical imaging systems. However, due to barriers in programming of custom software and on-board image analysis pipelines, many research prototypes fail to achieve a prospective clinical evaluation as intended. Effective clinical use cases appear to be those in which handheld, noninvasive image guidance is needed and accommodated by the clinical workflow. Handheld systems for in vivo, multispectral, and quantitative fluorescence imaging are a promising development for diagnostic and treatment guidance applications. Conclusions: A holistic assessment of SBI systems must include interpretation of their value for intended clinical settings and how their implementations enable better workflow. A set of six guidelines are proposed to evaluate appropriateness of smartphone utilization in terms of clinical context, completeness, compactness, connectivity, cost, and claims. Ongoing work should prioritize realistic clinical assessments with quantitative and qualitative comparison to non-smartphone systems to clearly demonstrate the value of smartphone-based systems. Improved hardware design to accommodate the rapidly changing smartphone ecosystem, creation of open-source image acquisition and analysis pipelines, and adoption of robust calibration techniques to address phone-to-phone variability are three high priority areas to move SBI research forward.","output":"Smartphone-based imaging systems for medical applications: a critical review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current investigations of the COVID-19 spreading model are presented through the artificial neuron networks (ANNs) with training of the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LMB), i.e., ANNs-LMB.

Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, received full approval in 2017 for second-line (2 L) treatment of EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC. The REFLECT study characterizes real-world treatment/testing patterns, attrition rates, and outcomes in patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC treated with 1 L first-/second-generation (1G/2G) EGFR-TKIs before 1 L osimertinib approval. Methods: Retrospective chart review (NCT04031898) of European/Israeli adults with EGFRm unresectable locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC, initiating 1 L 1G/2G EGFR-TKIs 01/01/15-30/06/18 (index date). Results: In 896 patients (median follow-up of 21.5 months), the most frequently initiated 1 L EGFR-TKI was afatinib (45%). Disease progression was reported in 81%, including 10% (86/896) who died at 1 L. By the end of study, most patients discontinued 1 L (85%), of whom 33% did not receive 2 L therapy. From index, median 1 L real-world progression-free survival was 13.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.3-14.1) months; median overall survival (OS) was 26.2 (95% CI: 23.6-28.4) months. 71% of patients with 1 L progression were tested for T790M; 58% were positive. Of those with T790M, 95% received osimertinib in 2 L or later. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases were recorded in 22% at index, and 15% developed CNS metastases during treatment (median time from index 13.5 months). Median OS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 17.1-22.1) in patients with CNS metastases at index, 24.8 months (95% CIs not available) with CNS metastases diagnosed during treatment, and 30.3 months (95% CI: 27.1, 33.8) with no CNS metastases recorded. Conclusion: REFLECT is a large real-world study describing treatment patterns prior to 1 L osimertinib availability for EGFRm advanced NSCLC.

This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID-19-induced lung pathophysiology. Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 (CARDS) seems to present as two distinct phenotypes: type L and type H. The L refers to low elastance, ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the H refers to high pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability. However, the LUNG-SAFE (Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure) and ESICM (European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) Trials Groups have shown that 13% of the mechanically ventilated non-COVID-19 ARDS patients have the type-L phenotype. Other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients. The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of 1) renin-angiotensin system dysregulation, 2) thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3) endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction perfusion control, and 4) hyperperfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model. A flowchart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time-controlled adaptive ventilation method, to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation mode, which recently was shown to be effective at improving oxygenation and reducing inspiratory fraction of oxygen, vasopressors, and sedation in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Functional pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury and clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simple and rapid reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study was part of a quality improvement program evaluating safety and efficacy of anticoagulation protocols at our large, metropolitan public hospital. We implemented a D-dimer-based guideline for dosing unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients that allowed for up-titration from standard prophylactic dosing to escalated prophylactic dosing or therapeutic dosing based on patient risk and presence of known or highly suspected VTE. Primary endpoints were International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)-defined major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events and in-hospital survival. Findings Among 262 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020, 125 (73.1%) were male. Highest anticoagulation dose was: 65.3% prophylactic, 13.4% escalated prophylactic, 21.4% therapeutic. The dose was uptitrated in 83 (31.6%) patients. Bleeding events were comparable between the therapeutic (12.5%) and escalated prophylactic groups (11.4%), but significantly higher than in the prophylactic group (1.2%).

The aims of this study were to investigate parents' and caregivers' knowledge of CoVID-19 in children, to understand their levels of concern and to identify their most trusted sources of information. METHODS Participants were recruited via NZ parenting support and interest groups on Facebook.com. Knowledge was assessed by way of a self-administered questionnaire during the 10 days prior to NZ schools reopening on 18 May 2020. RESULTS Of the 1191 study participants, 721 (60%) expressed some level of worry (14.5% very or extremely worried) that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school.

METHODS: A prospective observational study assessed 247 consecutive women candidates for a pessary to manage symptomatic POP. Patients were fitted with a ring pessary and follow-up visits were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Pessary complications and reasons for discontinuation were recorded. Prolapse Quality of Life Questionnaire (P-QoL) was applied at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. We used a logistic regression model for the analyses, with p < 0.05 for significance. RESULTS: A total of 236 women were included in the study, of whom 110 (46.6%) maintained the pessary treatment for longer than 12 months. The main reason for pessary discontinuation was the patient opting for surgery (50.8%). Vulvovaginitis was the main long-term complication (44.5%), followed by vaginal ulceration (16.4%) and urinary urgency (10%). No prior hysterectomy (OR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.19-4.31), vaginal estrogen use (OR = 1.94; 95% CI 1.06-3.52), and mean age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were variables associated with long-term use of vaginal pessary (p < 0.05 for all).

The types of messages that may be effective in alerting smokers to this risk and encouraging a quit attempt are unknown. The aim of this study was to test a series of messages to identify potentially effective communication approaches. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 1509 smokers across three countries (Australia: n = 604; New Zealand: n = 304; United Kingdom: n = 601) in AprilCMay 2020. Respondents were randomly assigned to view just one of four quit messages, two of which explicitly referred to the coronavirus, one referred to risk of chest infection, and one encouraged cessation for financial reasons. Outcome variables included quit intentions, further information seeking, message perceptions, and health and financial concerns. RESULTS: All four messages were associated with significant differences in the proportions of respondents intending to quit within the following 2 wk (increase range: 11%C34%) and with substantial proportions of respondents electing to access additional information (range: 37%C50%). The differences in intentions were significantly larger for the two health-related messages that specifically mentioned the coronavirus. All messages were perceived favorably in terms of acceptability, believability, effectiveness, and personal relevance. Negligible differences in health and financial concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom appear likely to be receptive to messages about their COVID-related risk. Such messages have the potential to increase quit intentions and prompt information-seeking behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an opportunity to encourage smokers to quit to reduce both their COVID-related risks and their risks of a broad range of noncommunicable diseases.","output":"The Potential Effectiveness of COVID-Related Smoking Cessation Messages in Three Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reflects on the response to the pandemic that emerged as it happened. We draw attention to the viral aspect of a pandemic namely how people understand and respond to pandemics. We are questioning the context and reasons for what we call an immeasurable but organized community response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital-based research is applied through observing both mainstream digital media and other forms of social media. We have categorized the way people respond to COVID-19 via social media into three thematic phases. In the first phase digital media was used to voice frustration and disappointment with the governments response. This has sparked public distrust of the governments ability to deal with the pandemic at the national level. In the second phase is confusion phase. The rise of public discussion about the pandemic shows that the public is concerned about the development of the COVID-19 news in the country. The last phase is negotiation phase. While COVID-19 is rapidly becoming a source of panic and confusion grassroots initiatives are emerging. These initiatives aim to help reduce panic and reduce socio-economic impacts.

Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation.

However, there are not enough studies on middle-aged residents in Japan or other Eastern countries to currently achieve this. Thus, the aim of this study was to comprehensively identify factors related to depression in middle-aged residents in Japan, an Eastern country. The study design was cross-sectional. A questionnaire survey was conducted among all community residents aged 40 to 59 in a rural municipality in Western Japan. The questionnaire contained items on demographic characteristics, psychological factors, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic factors. A Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze the relationships between depression and each assessed factor. Next, a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify comprehensive relationships between depression and its related factors. Data from 362 participants were analyzed. The average age was 51.5 years; 148 were male. A Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test demonstrated that many psychological factors, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic factors ware significantly related to depression. A logistic regression analysis showed that depression was significantly associated with male gender, low sense of coherence, high cognitive stress levels, low help-seeking behavior, poor quality sleep, and a lack of hobbies. Nagelkerke R(2) was 51%. This study revealed through multivariate analysis that depression was primarily associated with personal behavioral and psychological factors in Japan, an Eastern country with a holistic cultural background. This result is consistent with findings from Western countries.

It is unclear which designs underlie the eventual clinical utility of the smartphone tests. We have developed the smartphone Neurological Function Tests Suite (NeuFun-TS) and are systematically evaluating their psychometric properties against the gold standard of complete neurological examination digitalized into the NeurExTM app. This article examines the fifth and the most complex NeuFun-TS test, the Spiral tracing. We generated 40 features in the training cohort (22 healthy donors [HD] and 89 patients with multiple sclerosis [MS]) and compared their intraclass correlation coefficient, fold change between HD and MS, and correlations with relevant clinical and imaging outcomes. We assembled the best features into machine-learning models and examined their performance in the independent validation cohort (45 patients with MS). We show that by involving multiple neurological functions, complex tests such as spiral tracing are susceptible to intra-individual variations, decreasing their reproducibility and clinical utility. Simple tests, reproducibly measuring single function(s) that can be aggregated to increase sensitivity, are preferable in app design.","output":"Assessment of Smartphone-Based Spiral Tracing in Multiple Sclerosis Reveals Intra-Individual Reproducibility as a Major Determinant of the Clinical Utility of the Digital Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To update the clinical activity of the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP). MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of our clinic database from January 2004 until July 2008. The number of patients referred to the RRRP, relevant demographic data, diagnosis and treatment dispositions were recorded. Time interval between referral to consultation and consultation to simulation were also calculated. RESULTS During the study period, 3,267 patients were seen in the RRRP. Forty-five percent (1,494) of the patients were new to the clinic. Of the 3,267 patients seen, 1,548 (47.4%) were female and 1,719 (52.6%) were male. The median age was 69.2 years (range, 22-101 years). The most common primary sites were lung (34.2%), breast (21.2%) and prostate (17.0%). The majority of patients were referred for palliative treatment of bone metastases (52.4%) or treatment for brain metastases (20.7%). Of the patients referred, 2,311 (70.5%) patients received palliative radiotherapy. The median duration from referral to consultation was 4 days. The majority (82.3%) of patients were simulated and treated within the first 7 days following consultation. CONCLUSION The number of patients referred to the RRRP from January 2004-July 2008 remains comparable to our previous report (1996-2003). The overall median interval from referral to consultation for the analysed time period was 4 days.

More than ever, valid, transparent, and intuitive summaries of the treatment effects, including efficacy and harm, are needed. In recently published and ongoing randomized comparative trials evaluating treatments for COVID-19, time to a positive outcome, such as recovery or improvement, has repeatedly been used as either the primary or key secondary end point. Because patients may die before recovery or improvement, data analysis of this end point faces a competing risk problem. Commonly used survival analysis techniques, such as the KaplanCMeier method, often are not appropriate for such situations. Moreover, almost all trials have quantified treatment effects by using the hazard ratio, which is difficult to interpret for a positive event, especially in the presence of competing risks. Using 2 recent trials evaluating treatments (remdesivir and convalescent plasma) for COVID-19 as examples, a valid, well-established yet underused procedure is presented for estimating the cumulative recovery or improvement rate curve across the study period. Furthermore, an intuitive and clinically interpretable summary of treatment efficacy based on this curve is also proposed.

Here, we demonstrate that complex coacervation of the prion protein and -synuclein within narrow stoichiometry results in the formation of highly dynamic, reversible, thermo-responsive liquid droplets via domain-specific electrostatic interactions between the positively-charged intrinsically disordered N-terminal segment of prion and the acidic C-terminal tail of -synuclein. The addition of RNA to these coacervates yields multiphasic, vesicle-like, hollow condensates. Picosecond time-resolved measurements revealed the presence of transient electrostatic nanoclusters that are stable on the nanosecond timescale and can undergo breaking-and-making of interactions on slower timescales giving rise to a liquid-like behavior in the mesoscopic regime. The liquid-to-solid transition drives a rapid conversion of complex coacervates into heterotypic amyloids.

Key approaches include screening patients who are at risk but have no symptoms, and rapidly and appropriately investigating those who do. Machine learning, whereby computers learn complex data patterns to make predictions, has the potential to revolutionise early cancer diagnosis. Here, we provide an overview of how such algorithms can assist doctors through analyses of routine health records, medical images, biopsy samples and blood tests to improve risk stratification and early diagnosis. Such tools will be increasingly utilised in the coming years. ABSTRACT: Improving the proportion of patients diagnosed with early-stage cancer is a key priority of the World Health Organisation. In many tumour groups, screening programmes have led to improvements in survival, but patient selection and risk stratification are key challenges. In addition, there are concerns about limited diagnostic workforces, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing a strain on pathology and radiology services. In this review, we discuss how artificial intelligence algorithms could assist clinicians in (1) screening asymptomatic patients at risk of cancer, (2) investigating and triaging symptomatic patients, and (3) more effectively diagnosing cancer recurrence. We provide an overview of the main artificial intelligence approaches, including historical models such as logistic regression, as well as deep learning and neural networks, and highlight their early diagnosis applications. Many data types are suitable for computational analysis, including electronic healthcare records, diagnostic images, pathology slides and peripheral blood, and we provide examples of how these data can be utilised to diagnose cancer. We also discuss the potential clinical implications for artificial intelligence algorithms, including an overview of models currently used in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines to design contact tracing apps as persuasive technologies to make them more appealing and effective. METHODS: We identified the limitations of the current contact tracing apps on the market using the Government of Canadas official exposure notification app (COVID Alert) as a case study. Particularly, we identified three interfaces in the COVID Alert app where the design can be improved. The interfaces include the no exposure status interface, exposure interface, and diagnosis report interface. We propose persuasive technology design guidelines to make them more motivational and effective in eliciting the desired behavior change. RESULTS: Apart from trust and privacy concerns, we identified the minimalist and nonmotivational design of exposure notification apps as the key design-related factors that contribute to the current low uptake. We proposed persuasive strategies such as self-monitoring of daily contacts and exposure time to make the no exposure and exposure interfaces visually appealing and motivational. Moreover, we proposed social learning, praise, and reward to increase the diagnosis report interfaces effectiveness.

Sustained use of patient portal features such as secure messaging (SM) can provide accessible support for diabetes self-management. OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether rural patients self-management and glycemic control was associated with the use of SM. METHODS: This secondary, cross-sectional, mixed methods analysis of 448 veterans with diabetes used stratified random sampling to recruit a diverse sample from the United States (rural vs urban and good vs poor glycemic control). Administrative, clinical, survey, and interview data were used to determine patients rurality, use of SM, diabetes self-management behaviors, and glycemic control. Moderated mediation analyses assessed these relationships. RESULTS: The sample was 51% (n=229) rural and 49% (n=219) urban. Mean participant age was 66.4 years (SD 7.7 years). More frequent SM use was associated with better diabetes self-management (P=.007), which was associated with better glycemic control (P<.001). Among rural patients, SM use was indirectly associated with better glycemic control through improved diabetes self-management (95% CI 0.004-0.927). These effects were not observed among urban veterans with diabetes (95% CI C1.039 to 0.056). Rural patients were significantly more likely than urban patients to have diabetes-related content in their secure messages (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent SM use is associated with engaging in diabetes self-management, which, in turn, is associated with better diabetes control. Among rural patients with diabetes, SM use is indirectly associated with better diabetes control.

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response, evaluated by four commercially available chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), was qualitatively consistent with the results provided by the gold-standard in vitro neutralization assay (NTA). However, we could not observe a correlation between the quantity of the antibody detected by CLIA assays and their neutralizing activity tested by NTA.

There is scarce literature regarding the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes for these patients with coexisting viral infections (seropositive HNSCC). We conducted this study to assess the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes (overall survival [OS] and disease-specific survival [DSS]) of seropositive HNSCC patients. Methodology: This was a retrospective cohort study on seropositive HNSCC patients registered at our center from 2012 to 2014. The viral infections were identified by the presence of the antibodies to these viruses in the patient's blood samples. Results: Out of the 19,137 HNSCC patients registered, 156 patients had HBV, HCV, and/or HIV infection. Among these, HBV infection was the most common (n = 86/156, 55.1%) followed by HIV infection (n = 36/156, 23.1%) and HCV infection (n = 29/156, 18.6%).

This study was conducted on 6600 hospitalized patients with CVD and COVID-19 recruited between January 2020 and January 2021 in Iran. All patients were diagnosed with previous history of CVD like angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rhythms, and congenital heart disease before they were hospitalized for COVID-19. We collected data on patients signs and symptoms, clinical and paraclinical examinations, and any underlying comorbidities. t-test was used to determine the significant difference between the two deceased and alive groups. In addition, the relation between pairs of symptoms and pairs of comorbidities has been determined via correlation computation.Findings: Our findings suggest that signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, chest pain, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia had no impact on patients' mortality. There was a significant correlation between COVID-19 cardiovascular patients mortality rate and symptoms such as headache, Loss of consciousness (LOC), oxygen saturation less than 93%, and need for mechanical ventilation. We observed no relationship in cardiac cases between mortality and comorbidities such as diabetes, cancer, pulmonary diseases, renal diseases, hematologic disorders, neurological diseases, and hypertension.

Whilst an age-based vaccination approach prioritising older groups is being implemented worldwide, vaccine hesitancy is high amongst minority ethnic groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and convergent synthesis to systematically examine perceptions of vaccinations amongst older adults from minority ethnic backgrounds. We included studies that reported on perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes towards vaccinations in older adults aged 65 years from a minority ethnic background. We excluded studies of vaccinations in investigation or development, studies focused on specific medical conditions, studies where ethnic background or age group was unidentifiable, systematic reviews, editorials, and conference abstracts. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, and PROSPERO databases from inception to 15 July 2021. Risk of bias for studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The quality of evidence of collective outcomes was estimated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and EvaluationCConfidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADECCERQual) framework. A total of 28 eligible studies conducted between 1997 and 2020 were included in the final analysis (17 quantitative surveys, 8 focus group or interview studies, 2 mixed methods studies, and 1 caseCcontrol study). The majority were US studies in English or Spanish, except for 6 studies set in Hong Kong, 2 studies in Japan, 1 study in Brazil, and 1 multi-centre study (including China, Indonesia, Turkey, South Korea, Greece, UK, Brazil, and Nigeria). In total, 28,262 individuals with an estimated mean age of 69.8 years were included, 63.2% of whom were female. We summarised the common concepts and themes across studies and populations using a convergent synthesis analysis. Thirteen themes categorised as barriers or facilitators were identified and grouped into structural factorshealthcare provider and system related, patient related, and policy and operationaland were analysed by minority ethnic group. The main limitation of the study was the predominance of studies from the US and East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found that factors influencing vaccination uptake involve healthcare provider and system, patient-related, and governance-level factors that are specific to the older ethnic minority community being served. The evidence included in this review is supported by high or moderate certainty and can be translated to practice and policy. A tailored, multi-level approach combining increased education, access, and culturally competent discussions with trusted healthcare professionals to address health beliefs can maximise the potential impact of widespread vaccination policies.","output":"Vaccination uptake amongst older adults from minority ethnic backgrounds: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) are inflammation-based novel markers that predict the prognosis in various patient populations. We have investigated the relationship between the disease severity in COVID-19, and the PNI and SII scores in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study included 118 hospitalised patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients were divided into two groups as those who were hospitalised at the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had been internalised at the clinic (non-ICU). RESULTS: Of the 118 patients, 50.8% were male. The mean age was 57.7  17.5 years in non-ICU patients and 70.3  11.7 years in ICU patients and the difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The lymphocyte count and the albumin levels were significantly lower in ICU patients (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The PNI score was significantly lower in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (P < .001). The SII score was found to be significantly higher in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (P < .001). The value of PNI and SII scores in prediction of the disease severity in COVID-19 was evaluated with the ROC analysis (PNI: AUC = 0.796, 95%CI: 0.715-0.877, P < .001; SII: AUC =0.689, 95% CI: 0.559-0.819, P=.004). When the cut-off value was taken as &#8804;36.7 for the PNI score, it was found to have 73.4% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was 4.4 times higher. When the cut-off value was taken as &#8805;813.6 for SII score, it was found to have 70.8% sensitivity and 66.0% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was six times higher.

The gap between established rules and hospital reality led to psychological distress and burnout. Managing uncertainty in medical decisions is a skill that doctors and staff learn through experience. However, with the covid-19 pandemic, uncertainty about patient outcomes seems no longer acceptable. Geriatric triage has challenged professional conscience, emotions and values. The principle of distributive justice, which consists of giving each person in society what is rightfully theirs, is not being respected during this pandemic. Charity has been reduced to patient survival. Staff need to make decisions together, and it is important to allow all carers access to a space for reflection. In our unit, the involvement of nurses and care assistants in the decision-making process for patient care is crucial especially for refusal of care. Their view of the patient's condition is different from that of the doctors, as they provide daily care to the patient and stay in the wards for several hours with them.

These molecules are able to directly inhibit many viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through binding to envelope protein N-glycans. In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. In this study we aimed at evaluating the HCV resistance to CBAs in vitro. HCV was cultivated in the presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cyanovirin-N, Concanavalin-A or Griffithsin concentrations, during more than eight weeks. At the end of lectin exposure, the genome of the isolated strains was sequenced and several potential resistance mutations in the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were identified. The effect of these mutations on viral fitness as well as on sensitivity to inhibition by lectins, soluble CD81 or the 3/11 neutralizing antibody was assessed. Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins.

DESIGN: Pragmatic, descriptive, feasibility study from April 2 to April 9, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 83 older residents (age 85  8) presenting mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and not previously tested for COVID-19, residing in 5 nursing homes in Northern Italy. METHODS: Chest ultrasonography was performed at the bedside by a team of hospital specialists with certified expertise in thoracic ultrasonography, following a systematic approach exploring 4 different areas for each hemithorax, from the anterior and posterior side. Presence of ultrasonographic signs of interstitial pneumonia, including comet-tail artifacts (B-lines) with focal or diffuse distribution, subpleural consolidations, and pleural line indentation, was detected. The specialist team integrated ultrasonography data with clinical and anamnestic information, and gave personalized therapeutic advice for each patient, including hospital referral when needed. RESULTS: The most frequent reasons for ultrasonographic evaluation were fever (63% of participants) and mild dyspnea (40%). Fifty-six patients (67%) had abnormal ultrasonographic findings.

Presence of viral RNA in fecal samples for longer period, even after the clearance of the virus from respiratory tract, is suggestive of dysbiosis leading to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Gut microbiome (GM) plays a significant role to stimulate the modulated antiviral immune response against invading pathogens regulating the physiological homeostasis. GM profile of COVID-19 patients has revealed the drastic depletion of dominant families of commensals in the gut such as, Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae to be replaced with Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Serratia etc. Immune dysfunction of Th1CTh17 cells along gut-lung axis impairs the mucosal lining translocating the microorganisms including commensals and metabolites to other body organs like lungs, brain, kidney through circulation. These events may cause hyper inflammations associated with excessive secretion of cytokines and chemokines to form the cytokine storm causing ARDS.

Consequently, the establishment of rapid diagnostic tools and quick isolation of infected patients is highly essential. Furthermore, the requirement of point-of-care testing is the need of the hour. Considering this, we have provided a brief review of the use of very recently reported robust spectral tools for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The spectral tools include, colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), with the admittance of principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning (ML) for meeting the high-throughput and fool-proof diagnostic platforms for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, are reviewed.

Patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies (Abs) had hallmarks of original antigenic sin (OAS), including early IgG upregulation and cytokine-associated injury. Thus, the immunological memory of a previous infection was hypothesized to drive formation of suboptimal anti-Ep9 Abs in severe COVID-19 infections. This study identifies a putative original antigen capable of stimulating production of cross-reactive, anti-Ep9 Abs. From bioinformatics analysis, 21 potential original epitope regions were identified. Binding assays with patient blood samples directly show cross-reactivity between Abs binding to Ep9 and only one homologous potential antigen, a sequence derived from the neuraminidase protein of H3N2 Influenza A virus. This cross-reactive binding affinity is highly virus strain specific and sensitive to even single amino acid changes in epitope sequence. The neuraminidase protein is not present in the influenza vaccine, and the anti-Ep9 Abs likely resulted from the widespread influenza infection in 2014.

Despite prompt treatment with three technically successful thrombectomies along with systemic intravenous heparin and two rounds of catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, the fistula rapidly re-thrombosed each time and he required tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He subsequently required admission for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimately developed a catheter-related blood stream infection that likely contributed to his death. As the fistula had been previously well functioning and no angiographic explanation for the thrombosis was found, we speculate in this case the recurrent thromboses were related to the hypercoagulable state characteristic of severe COVID-19.

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS: The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively.

Spearmans correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, logistic regression model, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were employed in the analysis. Of 79 patients enrolled, 2 died in hospital, 8 were transferred to other hospitals, and 69 were discharged. Patients with elevated ferritin levels (> 200 ng/mL) had a higher incidence of severity illness when compared with those with normal ferritin levels ( 200 ng/mL) (50.0% vs 2.9%). In addition, severity illness manifested significantly higher level of ferritin as compared with non-severe ones (median 921.3 vs 130.7 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Furthermore, ferritin could effectively discriminate severity and non-severity, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) reaching 0.873 (sensitivity 96%, specificity 70%), larger than that of age (0.697), C-reactive protein (0.730) and lymphocytes% (0.717).

METHODS: In February 2020, non-local medical workers who had been sent to Wuhan as support staff to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak were asked to complete an online survey composed of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: Survey responses from 114 non-local medical workers were analyzed. CD-RISC scores were high (67.03  13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48  11.49), followed by support staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78  12.43) and nurses (64.86  13.46). Respondents differed significantly in the levels of education, training/support provided by the respondents permanent hospital (where he or she normally works), and in their feelings of being adequately prepared and confident to complete tasks (P < 0.05). Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety (r = ?.498, P < 0.01) and depression (r = ?.471, P < 0.01) but positively with active coping styles (r = .733, P < 0.01).

One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature regarding global surgical outreach programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of global surgical outreach programs were identified, and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors. RESULTS: As global surgical outreach programs were canceled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions to continue to engage with low- and middle-income country partners. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of global surgical outreach programs may begin to be considered. Important considerations before initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care.

Whereas proponents believe these orders help reduce person-to-person contact and therefore the spread of the pandemic, opponents argue these orders are unnecessary and ineffective. In this study, we use eight states that did not implement the orders as a control group and six neighboring states that did implement them as a treatment group to estimate the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders. We find that although residents in both groups were staying at home even before the implementation of any order, these orders reduced the number of new COVID-19 cases by 7.6%. To understand the mechanisms behind these results, we compare the mobility of residents in the control and treatment groups over time. We find stay-at-home orders significantly reduced residents' mobility at grocery stores and pharmacies, transit stations, workplaces, and retail and recreation locations.

METHODS A 2-week survival study evaluating transanal endoscopic rectosigmoid resection with stapled colorectal anastomosis was conducted with swine using the transanal approach alone (TEM group, n = 10) or a transanal approach combined with transgastric endoscopic assistance (TEM + TG group, n = 10). Gastrotomies were created using a needleknife and balloon dilation, then closed using prototype T-tags. Outcomes were evaluated and compared between the groups using Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Relative to the TEM group, the average length of rectosigmoid mobilized in the TEM + TG group was 15.6 versus 10.5 cm (p < 0.0005), the length of the resected specimen was 9 versus 6.2 cm (p < 0.0005), and the mean operative time was 254.5 versus 97.5 min (p < 0.0005). Intraoperatively, no organ injury or major bleeding was noted. Two T-tag misfires occurred during gastrotomy closure and four small staple line defects requiring transanal repair including one in the TEM group and three in the TEM + TG group (p = 0.2). Postoperatively, there was no mortality, and the animals gained an average of 3.4 lb. Two major complications (10%) were identified at necropsy in the TEM + TG group including an intraabdominal abscess and an abdominal wall hematoma related to T-tag misfire. Gastrotomy closure sites and colorectal anastomoses were all grossly healed, with adhesions noted in 60 and 70% and microabscesses in 50 and 20% of the gastrotomy sites and colorectal anastomoses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for rectosigmoid resection using TEM with or without transgastric endoscopic assistance is feasible and associated with low morbidity in a porcine survival model. Transgastric assistance significantly prolongs the operative time but extends the length of the rectosigmoid mobilized transanally, with a nonsignificant increase in complication rates related to gastrotomy creation.","output":"Survival study of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery for rectosigmoid resection using transanal endoscopic microsurgery with or without transgastric endoscopic assistance in a swine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor is the molecular event that initiates viral entry into host cells and leads to infection and virus replication. There is a need for agents blocking viral entry into host cells that are cross-reactive with emerging virus variants. VHH-72 is an anti-SARS-CoV-1 single-domain antibody that also exhibits cross-specificity with SARS-CoV-2 but with decreased binding affinity. Here we applied a structure-based approach to affinity-mature VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein while retaining the original affinity for SARS-CoV-1. This was achieved by employing the computational platform ADAPT in a constrained dual-affinity optimization mode as a means of broadening specificity. Select mutants designed by ADAPT were formatted as fusions with a human IgG1-Fc fragment. These mutants demonstrated improved binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein due to decreased dissociation rates. Functional testing for virus neutralization revealed improvements relative to the parental VHH72-Fc up to 10-fold using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and 20-fold against the SARS-CoV-2 authentic live virus (Wuhan variant). Binding and neutralization improvements were maintained for some other SARS-CoV-2 variants currently in circulation. These improved VHH-72 mutants are predicted to establish novel interactions with the S antigen. They will be useful, alone or as fusions with other functional modules, in the global quest for treatments of COVID-19 infections.","output":"Structure-based dual affinity optimization of a SARS-CoV-1/2 cross-reactive single-domain antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gazelles (high-growth), unicorns (ventures valued at $1 billion), and decacorns (ventures valued at $10 billion) appear to be dominating the landscape of entrepreneurship.

These may have significant implications for the management of cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a systematic review of published evidence to assess the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases and their management. METHODS: Studies that evaluated volume of hospitalisations for cardiometabolic conditions and their management with comparisons between the COVID-19 and pre-COVID periods were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and the reference list of relevant studies from January 2020 to 25 February 2021. RESULTS: We identified 103 observational studies, with most studies assessing hospitalisations for acute cardiovascular conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic strokes and heart failure. About 89% of studies reported a decline in hospitalisations during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times, with reductions ranging from 20.2 to 73%. Severe presentation, less utilization of cardiovascular procedures, and longer patient- and healthcare-related delays were common during the pandemic. Most studies reported shorter length of hospital stay during the pandemic than before the pandemic (1-8 vs 2-12 days) or no difference in length of stay. Most studies reported no change in in-hospital mortality among hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: Clinical care of patients for acute cardiovascular conditions, their management and outcomes have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be educated via population-wide approaches on the need for timely medical contact and health systems should put strategies in place to provide timely care to patients at high risk.

This is the first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant, CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB, accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 6  10-4 M CTAB allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition).

A horse racetrack in California experienced a COVID-19 outbreak among staff and used BinaxNOW to supplement RT-PCR. Utility of BinaxNOW in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a workplace outbreak was assessed. METHODS: Between November 25CDecember 22, 2020, anterior nasal swabs were collected from racetrack staff for six rounds of paired BinaxNOW and RT-PCR tests. BinaxNOW tests were interpreted according to manufacturer instructions. RT-PCR was performed at the state public health lab using the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit. Staff with positive results on either test were isolated and removed from subsequent testing. Viral cultures were attempted on specimens with cycle threshold (C(t)) < 30. RESULTS: Overall, 769 paired results from 342 staff were analyzed. Most were of Hispanic ethnicity (62.0%) and ages ranged from 18 to 92 years (median 52). BinaxNOW performance compared to RT-PCR (95% CI) was as follows: positive percent agreement (PPA) 43.3% (34.6%C52.4%); negative percent agreement (NPA) 100% (99.4%C100%); positive predictive value (PPV) 100% (93.5%C100%); negative predictive value 89.9% (87.5%C92.0%). Among 127 RT-PCR-positive specimens, those with paired BinaxNOW-positive results (n = 55) had a lower mean C(t) value than those with paired BinaxNOW-negative results (n = 72) (17.8 vs. 28.5) (p < 0.001). In dual positive pairs, median time from specimen collected to RT-PCR result reported was 4 days (range 1-6), compared to the 15-minute BinaxNOW reporting time. Of 100 C(t) < 30 specimens, 51 resulted in positive virus isolation, 45 (88.2%) of which were BinaxNOW-positive. CONCLUSION: High NPA and PPV support immediate isolation of BinaxNOW-positive individuals, while low PPA supports confirmatory testing following BinaxNOW-negative results. BinaxNOW performed better in paired specimens with lower C(t) value and positive viral cultures, which could suggest that among RT-PCR-positive specimens, those that are BinaxNOW-negative may be less likely to contain infectious virus than those that are BinaxNOW-positive.

We demonstrate the technical feasibility of providing oxygen to a bulk medium, such as blood, via diffusion across non-porous hollow fiber membranes (HFM) using hyperbaric oxygen. The oxygen transfer across Teflon? membranes was characterized at oxygen pressures up to 2 bars in both a stirred tank vessel (CSTR) and a tubular device mimicking intravenous application. Fluxes over 550 mL min-1 m-2 were observed in well mixed systems, and just over 350 mL min-1 m-2 in flow through tubular systems. Oxygen flux was proportional to the oxygen partial pressure inside the HFM over the tested range and increased with mixing of the bulk liquid. Some bubbles were observed at the higher pressures (1.9 bar) and when bulk liquid dissolved oxygen concentrations were high. High frequency ultrasound was applied to detect and count individual bubbles, but no increase from background levels was detected during lower pressure operation. A conceptual model of the oxygen transport was developed and validated. Model parametric sensitivity studies demonstrated that diffusion through the thin fiber walls was a significant resistance to mass transfer. Promoting convection around the fibers should enable physiologically relevant oxygen supply.

Only in one system out of six, the planet beta Pic c will enter the envelope of its parent star during the AGB phase. For that to occur, we have to reduce the wind mass-loss rate by a factor of about four from its commonly used value. This strengthens an early conclusion, which was based on exoplanets with circular orbits, that states that to have a non-negligible fraction of AGB stars that engulf planets we should consider lower wind mass-loss rates of isolated AGB stars (before they are spun-up by a companion).

Methods: Subjects from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group registry with data on N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and C-reactive protein were identified. Outcomes of interest were death, systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% or medications for heart failure), pulmonary arterial hypertension by right heart catheterization, pulmonary hypertension by cardiac echocardiography (systolic pulmonary artery pressures a 45 mmHg), arrhythmias (pacemaker/implantable cardiac defibrillator or anti-arrhythmic medications), and interstitial lung disease. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were generated for each outcome. Results: A total of 675 subjects were included with a mean follow-up of 3.0  1.8 years. Subjects were predominantly women (88.4%) with mean age of 58.2  11.3 years and mean disease duration of 13.7  9.1 years. One hundred and one (101, 15%) subjects died during follow-up, 37 (6.4 %) developed systolic dysfunction, 18 (2.9%) arrhythmias, 34 (5.1%) pulmonary arterial hypertension, 43 (7.3%) pulmonary hypertension, and 48 (12.3%) interstitial lung disease. In multivariate analyses, elevated levels of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and C-reactive protein were associated with increased risk of death, while elevated levels of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein were associated with increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Conclusion: In systemic sclerosis, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and C-reactive protein have independent predictive value for death and pulmonary hypertension.

In 2019 the MITS Surveillance Alliance supported the implementation of small-scale postmortem studies using MITS in several LMICs. METHODS: In this article we describe the preparations, challenges, and lessons learned as part of implementing MITS across 4 study sites in 3 countries: Nepal, Rwanda, and Tanzania. We describe the process for building capacity to conduct MITS, which consisted of training in MITS sample collection, individual site assessment to determine readiness and gaps prior to implementation, site visits as sites began implementation of MITS, and feedback based on remote evaluation of histology slides via an online portal. RESULTS: The 4 study sites each conducted 100 MITS, for a total of 400. All 4 sites lacked sufficient infrastructure and facilities to conduct MITS, and upgrades were required. Common challenges faced by sites included that clinical autopsies were neither routinely conducted nor widely accepted. Limited clinical records made cause of death determination more difficult. Lessons learned included the importance of sensitization of the community and medical staff to MITS to enhance understanding and increase consent. CONCLUSIONS: The study sites accomplished MITS and utilized the available support systems to overcome the challenges.

Patients with inflammatory arthritis are more vulnerable to pain, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. These complaints are linked in a cyclical pattern that may negatively affect daily-life activities (2-4). To our knowledge, the impact of pandemic on sleep disturbances in patients with inflammatory arthritis has not been evaluated yet. Objectives: The aim of this study is to establish the COVID-19 related impact on sleep disturbances among patients with inflammatory arthritis who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Methods: Data about chronic inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA] and ankylosing spondylitis [AS]) were retrieved from a large nationwide online survey involving patients affected by different rheumatic diseases. From May to September 2020, eleven patients' associations sent a call to rheumatic patients asking them to complete an anonymous online survey with specific questions also about sleep disturbances and pre-and post-lockdown self-reported use of psychopharmacotherapy. Data were analysed by a binary logistic regression model having the presence of sleep disturbances during COVID 19 pandemic as dependent variable. Results: 375 of 507 (74%) of patients had inflammatory arthritis: 249 RA, 77 PsA and 49 AS. 291 (77.6%) were females with a median (IQR) age of 54 (44-63) years. There was an increase in the use of psychiatric compounds after quarantine period (59 [15,7%] vs 65 [17,3%]), especially for sleep medications (23 [6,1%] vs 28 [7,5%]) and anxiolytics (15 [4%] vs 18 [4,8%]). 246 (65.6%) of patients had trouble staying asleep, 238 (63.5%) had trouble falling asleep, and 112 (29.9%) had dreams about pandemic (Figure 1 below). Conclusion: These results confirm that sleep disturbances have been a relevant concern in patients with inflammatory arthritis after COVID-19 national lockdown. Changes in daily life related to confinement have influenced psychological distress leading to a significant impact on sleep difficulties such as inability to fall early asleep or to maintain adequate sleep. Furthermore, older patients who had coronavirus infection and were previously treated for psychiatric disorders were at higher risk developing sleep disorders.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep disorders in patients with inflammatory arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The new coronavirus disease pandemic is defining 2020, with almost 17.5 million infected individuals and 700 thousand deaths up to beginning of August. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission is through the respiratory tract. Those infected may be asymptomatic, present typical symptoms (fever, dry cough and dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) and viral RNA in stools. The objective of this work was to review the literature related to the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and to check the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. We searched PubMed? database on COVID-19 and gastrointestinal tract and selected articles using the PRISMA method. We eliminated articles based on titles and abstracts, small number of patients and the mechanism of infection, leaving 14 studies. Comorbidities and laboratory alterations (elevation of hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin) were related to worsening of the disease. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms ranged from 6.8% to 61.3%, including diarrhea (8.14% to 33.7%), nausea/vomiting (1.53% to 26.4%), anorexia (12.1% to 40.0%) and abdominal pain (0% to 14.5%). The presence of viral RNA in stools was rarely tested, but positive in 0% to 48.1%. The gastrointestinal tract is affected by COVID-19, causing specific symptoms, laboratory alterations and viral presence in the feces. However, the results of prevalence and possibility of fecal-oral transmission were varied, requiring further studies for more assertive conclusions.

Typical mechanistic epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact processes or need real-time or archived population mobility data to simulate the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. FINDINGS: While it is often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the impact of creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city. Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales demonstrated in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in addition to the contact network and population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of transit are strongly correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road connectivity networks using open-source imageries and travel patterns from open-source surveys and government reports. Within the proposed framework, we then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns, and enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread. SCOPE: Our results suggest that the declaration of micro-containment zones within the city with high road network density combined with enhanced testing can help in containing the outbreaks until clinical interventions become available.","output":"Assessing the interplay between travel patterns and SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in realistic urban setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir (RDV) is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are active in some RNA viruses, including the Ebola virus and zoonotic coronaviruses. When severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several investigations have assessed the potential activity of RDV in inhibiting viral replication, giving rise to hope for an effective treatment. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors describe the main investigations leading to the discovery of RDV and its subsequent development as an antiviral agent, focusing on the main clinical trials investigating its efficacy in terms of symptom resolution and mortality reduction. EXPERT OPINION: RDV is the most widely investigated antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. This attention on RDV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is justified by promising in vitro studies, which demonstrated that RDV was able to suppress viral replication without significant toxicity. Such activity was confirmed by an investigation in an animal model and by the results of preliminary clinical investigations. Nevertheless, the efficacy of RDV in reducing mortality has not been clearly demonstrated.","output":"An overview of the preclinical discovery and development of remdesivir for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its spread since 2019 represents the major public health problem worldwide nowadays, which has generated a high number of infections and deaths. The spike protein (S protein) is the most studied protein of SARS-CoV-2, and key to host-cell entry through ACE2 receptor. This protein presents a large pattern of glycosylations with important roles in immunity and infection mechanisms. Therefore, understanding key aspects of the molecular mechanisms of these structures, during drug recognition in SARS-CoV-2, may contribute to therapeutic alternatives. In this work, we explored the impact of glycosylations on the drug recognition on two domains of the S protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) through molecular dynamics simulations and computational biophysics analysis. Our results show that glycosylations in the S protein induce structural stability and changes in rigidity/flexibility related to the number of glycosylations in the structure. These structural changes are important for its biological activity as well as the correct interaction of ligands in the RBD and NTD regions. Additionally, we evidenced a roto-translation phenomenon in the interaction of the ligand with RBD in the absence of glycosylation, which disappears due to the influence of glycosylation and the convergence of metastable states in RBM. Similarly, glycosylations in NTD promote an induced fit phenomenon, which is not observed in the absence of glycosylations; this process is decisive for the activity of the ligand at the cryptic site. Altogether, these results provide an explanation of glycosylation relevance in biophysical properties and drug recognition to S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which must be considered in the rational drug development and virtual screening targeting S protein.","output":"Glycosylation is key for enhancing drug recognition into spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical impact of telemedicine-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone following the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

The goal of this paper is to report the outcomes of 11 patients who underwent humeral fracture surgery in the first few weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of 11 patients who underwent humeral fracture surgery during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, between March 10 and April 25, 2020. The clinical outcomes of these operative patients were monitored up to May 12, 2020, the final date of follow-up, a minimum of 15 days after all patients were discharged from the hospital. COVID-19 infection, mortality, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-six humeral fractures were recorded between March 10 and April 25, 2020. During this period, humeral fracture fixation was the third most common surgery for fracture in our institution after hip fracture and ankle fracture surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgery (30.5%), of whom 7 were women (63.3%). The mean age was 64.8 years (standard deviation, 13.5). Nine operated cases had a proximal humerus fracture and 2 had a humeral shaft fracture. One of the 11 patients was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of throat swab samples. The overall median surgical time was 101.2 minutes (standard deviation, 28.4). The overall median hospital length stay for the patient discharged was 2.2 days (range, 1-4 days).

Furthermore, no COVID-19 infection was reported in the shoulder surgeons who performed the surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Although humeral fractures were not the most frequent fractures during this outbreak, some required surgery. With good preoperative management that included reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 and chest radiographs, protective measurements for the surgical team, and rapid discharge of the patients, we were able to operate on 11 humeral fractures with no COVID-19 nosocomial intrahospital infection in the patients or in the shoulder surgeons who performed the surgeries.","output":"Patient outcomes after humeral fracture surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital health is becoming more integrated in daily medical practice.

Here, we use quantile regression to model the roles of globalisation, human settlement and population characteristics as socio-spatial determinants of COVID-19 diffusion over a six-week period in March and April 2020. Results: : The quantile regression model suggest that globalisation and settlement population characteristics related to high human mobility predict disease diffusion. Human development level (HDI) and total population predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a high number of total confirmed cases per million whereas larger household size, older populations, and globalisation tied to human interaction predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a low number of total confirmed cases per million. Conclusions: : The analysis confirms that globalisation, settlement and population characteristics lead to greater disease diffusion, and primarily variables tied to high human mobility. These outcomes serve to inform policies around flattening the curve, particularly as they related to anticipated relocation diffusion from more- to less-developed countries and regions, and hierarchical diffusion from countries with higher population and density.

This calls for interventions aiming to reduce anxiety. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Heart & Mind Trial consists of three parts: (1) screening of all hospitalised and outpatient cardiac patients with arrhythmia, heart failure or ischaemic heart disease at four university hospitals in Denmark using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale (HADS-A); Patients scoring 8 is invited to participate; (2) Assessment of the type of anxiety by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and (3) Randomised clinical superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment, with 1:1 randomisation to cognitiveCbehavioural therapy (CBT) performed by a CBT-trained cardiac nurse plus usual care or, usual care alone. The primary outcome is anxiety measured with HADS-A at 5 months. Secondary outcomes include anxiety symptoms measured with Becks Anxiety Inventory and heart rate variability. Exploratory outcomes measured at 12 months include blood cortisol (stress response), blood C reactive protein (stress response), health-related quality of life, readmission, mortality and attributable direct costs. A total of 336 patients will be included. The primary analyses are based on the intention-to-treat principle. For the primary outcome, we will use a linear regression model. For the long-term outcomes, mixed regression models will be used including repeated measurements. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients must give informed consent prior to participation and the trial is initiated after approval by the Danish Data Protection Agency (P-2020-894) and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (H-20066739).

Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic.

METHODS: Eight hundred and forty-one Chinese college students (Mage = 19.50 years, SD = 1.580) completed the measures of stressors of COVID-19, stress consequences, rumination, and psychological support. RESULTS: Stressors of COVID-19 were significantly positively associated with stress consequences, and mediation analyses indicated that rumination partially mediated this association. Moderated mediation analysis further revealed that psychological support buffered the relation between stressors of COVID-19 and rumination, as well as the relation between rumination and stress consequences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Findings of this study demonstrated that stressors associated with COVID-19 is positively related to rumination, which in turn, is related to stress consequences in college students. However, psychological support buffered this effect at both indirect mediation paths, suggesting that college students with greater psychological support may be better equipped to prevent negative stress consequences.","output":"Stressors of COVID-19 and stress consequences: The mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of psychological support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Spontaneous rupture of kidney may involve collecting system or parenchyma. Parenchymal rupture usually occurs in patients with renal cell carcinoma, angiomyolipoma, renal cysts, arteriovenous malformation or vascular diseases such as periarteritis nodosa. Collecting system rupture is usually a rare complication of obstructive urolithiasis. We describe the unusual cases of spontaneous kidney rupture in patients with acute urinary obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION The case report describes the left parenchymal kidney explosion related to ipsilateral ureteral obstruction caused by a single ureteral stone. The patient reached our emergency department with acute left flank pain and massive haematuria. At the moment of admission, the patient was in stage III hypovolemic shock and had a lower haematocrit (haemoglobin = 4.9 g/dL). Despite blood transfusions, emergency surgical exploration, extrafascial nephrectomy and intensive support care, the patient died twelve hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Parenchymal renal rupture can be a life-threatening emergency. Despite its rarity, in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, parenchymal renal rupture should always be considered in patients with abdominal pain and an anamnesis or history of urinary stones, pointing out the need of early diagnosis also in benign urological conditions.","output":"A rare case of spontaneous parenchymal kidney explosion in a patient with ureteral obstruction caused by a single stone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global crude oil market has experienced a significant downturn following the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in December 2019 Thereafter, all the major oil markets have become extremely volatile, and investments in these markets could lead to substantial losses This paper empirically investigates the time-varying correlations between gold and oil markets to examine whether gold is a safe haven asset for the international crude oil markets during the COVID-19 period For the purpose of comparison, the safe haven property of Bitcoin is tested as well The results of the time-varying correlations obtained through the DCC-GARCH model suggest that gold is a safe haven asset for global crude oil markets Bitcoin, on the other hand, acts only as a diversifier for crude oil The results further show that the portfolio risk is minimized when investors include oil and gold in their portfolio rather than holding assets in oil and Bitcoin markets Given that financial downturn, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar global events often play a crucial role in portfolio risk analysis, our results could be of interest to those who invest in oil, gold and Bitcoin markets ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd","output":"COVID-19 and oil market crash: Revisiting the safe haven property of gold and Bitcoin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are associated with increased stress, burden, and depression among family caregivers of people with dementia. STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR-VTF) is adapted from an evidence-based, in-person program that trains family caregivers to manage BPSD. We used a human-centered design approach to obtain feedback from family caregivers about STAR-VTF. The program will be evaluated using a pragmatic randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to understand the needs of family caregivers for improving BPSD management and the extent to which caregivers perceived that STAR-VTF could address those needs. METHODS: Between July and September 2019, we conducted 15 semistructured interviews with family caregivers of people with dementia who receive care at Kaiser Permanente Washington in the Seattle metropolitan area. We identified participants from electronic health records, primarily based on a prescription for antipsychotic medication for the person with dementia (a proxy for caregivers dealing with BPSD). We showed caregivers low-fidelity prototypes of STAR-VTF online self-directed materials and verbally described potential design elements. We obtained caregiver feedback on these elements, focusing on their needs and preferences and perceived barriers to using STAR-VTF. We used a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and aggregated codes to develop themes. RESULTS: The idea of a virtual training program for learning to manage BPSD appealed to caregivers. They said health care providers did not provide adequate education in the early disease stages about the personality and behavior symptoms that can affect people with dementia. Caregivers found it unexpected and frustrating when the person with dementia began experiencing BPSD, symptoms they felt unprepared to manage. Accordingly, caregivers expressed a strong desire for the health care organization to offer programs such as STAR-VTF much sooner. Caregivers had already put considerable effort into problem solving challenging behaviors. They anticipated deriving less value from STAR-VTF at that point. Nonetheless, many were interested in the virtual aspect of the training due to the convenience of receiving help from home and the perception that help from a virtual program would be timelier than traditional service modalities (eg, face to face). Given caregivers' limited time, they suggested dividing the STAR-VTF content into chunks to review as time permitted. Caregivers were interested in having a STAR-VTF provider for additional support in managing challenging behaviors. Caregivers reported a preference for having the same coach for the program duration. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers we interviewed would likely accept a virtual training program such as STAR-VTF to obtain information about BPSD and receive help managing it. Family caregivers anticipated deriving more value if STAR-VTF was offered earlier in the disease course.","output":"Family Caregiver Needs and Preferences for Virtual Training to Manage Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness, but several clinical reports have described gastrointestinal symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can replicate within the stomach. Here we generate gastric organoids from fetal, pediatric, and adult biopsies as in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To facilitate infection, we induce reverse polarity in the gastric organoids. We find that the pediatric and late fetal gastric organoids are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, while viral replication is significantly lower in undifferentiated organoids of early fetal and adult origin. We demonstrate that adult gastric organoids are more susceptible to infection following differentiation. We perform transcriptomic analysis to reveal a moderate innate antiviral response and a lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we show that the virus can efficiently infect the gastric epithelium, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human gastric organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A man in his early 60s with a medical history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in remission for two decades without maintenance therapy presented with non-specific complaints of profound fatigue and 40-pound weight loss.

Near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy in conjunction with indocyanine green (ICG) allows for visualization of the microcirculation before formation of the anastomosis, thereby allowing the surgeon to choose the point of transection at an optimally perfused area. METHODS This is a retrospective case-control analysis examining the effectiveness of NIR + ICG in reducing the rate of AL after low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. Records of patients undergoing robot-assisted LAR for rectal cancer with and without ICG were analyzed for the years 2011 and 2012. RESULTS Among the 40 patients who underwent robotic LAR, NIR + ICG was used in 16 cases (41 %). Male patients accounted for the majority of cases in both groups (74 %). The median level of the anastomosis was 3.5 cm in the NIR + ICG group and 5.5 cm in the control group. There was no difference in the use of diverting ileostomy. In 3 patients (19 %), the use of NIR + ICG resulted in revision of the proximal bowel (colonic) transection point before formation of the anastomosis. The distal transection point was never revised. The rate of AL in the NIR + ICG group was 6 % versus 18 % in control group. CONCLUSIONS ICG fluorescence may play a role in anastomotic tissue perfusion assessment and affect the AL rate.

Studies have already documented reductions in sexual activity (sexual distancing) and interruptions in HIV/STI services, but it is unknown what combined impact these two forces will have on longer-term HIV/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS: We adapted a network-based model of co-circulating HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing in casual and one-time partnership networks and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, HIV PrEP, HIV ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS: A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: ?227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (?23,800 cases). Greater relative reductions and longer durations of service interruption would increase HIV and STI incidence, while greater relative reductions and longer durations of sexual distancing would decrease incidence of both. If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS: The counterbalancing impact of sexual distancing and clinical service interruption depends on the infection and the extent and durability of these COVID-related changes.

The efficacy of antiviral therapy in altering the dynamics was assessed by using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint based on the data retrieved from the two-arm Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial.

The novel coronavirus has spread across the world, infecting millions of people. Early-stage detection of critical cases of COVID-19 is essential. X-ray scans are used in clinical studies to diagnose COVID-19 and Pneumonia early. For extracting the discriminative features through these modalities, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used. A siamese convolutional neural network model (COVID-3D-SCNN) is proposed in this study for the automated detection of COVID-19 by utilizing X-ray scans. To extract the useful features, we used three consecutive models working in parallel in the proposed approach.

The primary aim of this study was to critically appraise available systematic reviews describing interventions for PPD. The secondary aim was to evaluate the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews and their conclusions. METHODS An electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2020 was conducted to identify systematic reviews that examined an intervention for PPD. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was utilized to independently score each included systematic review which was then critically appraised to better define the most effective therapeutic options for PPD. RESULTS Of the 842 studies identified, 83 met the a priori criteria for inclusion. Based on the systematic reviews with the highest methodological quality, we found that use of antidepressants and telemedicine were the most effective treatments for PPD. Symptoms of PPD were also improved by traditional herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Current evidence for physical exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in treating PPD remains equivocal. A significant, but weak relationship between AMSTAR score and journal impact factor was observed (p = 0.03, r = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.43) whilst no relationship was found between the number of total citations (p = 0.27, r = 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.09 to 0.34), or source of funding (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION Overall the systematic reviews on interventions for PPD are of low-moderate quality and are not improving over time.

METHODS: A 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) in San Diego County, USA. Self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, gratitude, resilience, mental and physical health were assessed in-person pre- and post-intervention, and by long-term follow-up surveys during COVID-19. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess study arm differences over time and logistic regression to identify predictors of positive intervention response. RESULTS: Of 182 randomized participants (72.6  7.9 yrs; 72% female), 131 completed the intervention. Modest improvements in health and wellbeing occurred post-intervention in both arms (Cohen's d: TC = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.25-0.51; HAP-E = 0.24, 0.11-0.37), though positive intervention responses were more than twice as likely in TC (OR = 2.29, 1.07-4.57). Younger age, higher anxiety, and poorer mental health at baseline predicted greater odds of response. Small declines in health and wellbeing were reported at the first COVID-19 follow-up, with smaller declines in the TC arm (Cohen's d: TC = -0.15, -0.31-0.00; HAP-E = -0.34, -0.49 to -0.19). Health and wellbeing stabilized at the second COVID-19 follow-up. Most participants (>70%) reported that the interventions benefitted their health and wellbeing during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: TC and HAP-E improved health and wellbeing, though TC conferred greater odds of an improved mental health response. Declines in health and wellbeing were observed at pandemic follow-up, with smaller declines in the TC arm, suggesting increased resilience.","output":"Tai chi or health education for older adults with hypertension: effects on mental health and psychological resilience to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this short communication is suggested by the labour market that has become very unpredictable and it is difficult to say what it will look like in five, 10 years or even more.

Time-sensitive management of cardiovascular emergencies such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has yet to be evaluated in the context of these new policies, particularly in so-called \\"hot spot\\" cities. METHODS: We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). RESULTS: The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P = 0.007). In contrast, additional safety protocols do not appear to have significantly affected delays between FMC and first intracoronary device activation (Group C 102 IQR [73.0, 133.0] min vs. Group A 104 IQR [87.0, 146.0] min vs. Group B 99.5 IQR [80.0, 150.0] min, P = 0.37). Patients that presented during the outbreak were more likely to be unstable with a higher incidence of Killip classes II-IV compared to groups A and B (28.3% vs. 18.3% vs. 5.6% respectively, P = 0.008). Worse in-hospital outcomes were also noted with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (Group A 5.0% vs. Group B 11.1% vs. Group C 22.6%, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, many patients appear to have been reluctant to present to hospitals. This was associated with more unstable STEMI presentations and worse in-hospital course.

Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, \\"coronavirus,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"quarantine\\") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included \\"virus,\\" \\"lockdown,\\" and \\"quarantine.\\" Popular bigrams included \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"stay home,\\" \\"corona virus,\\" \\"social distancing,\\" and \\"new cases.\\" We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning.

These estimates do not factor in the real price of IBD, which can impede career aspirations, instil social stigma and impair quality of life in patients. The Virtual Community Meeting, which offered an exchange of experience and opinions from healthcare professionals who are active in treating IBD, and patients with this chronic disease, revealed in-depth arguments and answers to some essential questions: which patients prefer subcutaneous over intravenous dosing; which patients continue to favour intravenous infusions; what are the limitations regarding both applications; what is the patients role in therapeutical decision-making and how does IBD affect the patients work, finances and quality of life? The aim of this article is to discuss the differences between subcutaneous and intravenous dosing from the health-economic, scientific, and personal perspectives. The meeting offered strong confirmation that most of the patients and healthcare professionals prefer subcutaneous over intravenous drug administration but emphasise the management of risks associated with treatment compliance.

The characteristic, outcome, and risk factor of COVID-19 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis remain unclear. Methods: Medical records were collected from 23 Chinese hospitals. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and age- and sex-matched non-liver disease patients were enrolled with 1:4 ratio using stratified sampling. Results: There were more comorbidities with higher Chalson Complication Index (p < 0.001), higher proportion of patients having gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, ascites, and diarrhea among those patients (p < 0.05) and in decompensated cirrhosis patients. Mortality (p < 0.05) and the proportion of severe ill (p < 0.001) were significantly high among those patients. Patients in severe ill subgroup had higher mortality (p < 0.001), MELD, and CRUB65 score but lower lymphocytes count. Besides, this subgroup had larger proportion of patients with abnormal (PT), activated partial thromboplatin time (APTT), D-Dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBL) and Creatinine (Cr) (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression for severity shown that MELD and CRUB65 score reached significance. Higher Child-Pugh and CRUB65 scores were found among non-survival cases and multivariate logistic regression further inferred risk factors for adverse outcome.

Moreover, the spillovers are intensified during the financial crisis, oil crisis and COVID-19 outbreak. WTI crude oil is the highest net contributor of volatility spillovers to the other markets, whereas the other energy markets are net receivers of spillovers for the different sub periods, with the exception of natural gas before the GFC and during COVID-19 as well as Brent oil during COVID-19. Furthermore, the results show significant integration and multiscale co-movements among energy futures. Natural gas asset offers better diversification benefits to crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and gas oil under short term. Finally, the diversification gains diminish as scales rise.

Its horrific manifestation at the community level significantly affects various dimensions of the quality of life (QoL) of all individuals. The study aimed to examine some of the predictors of the QoL during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey questionnaire was used to gather data on the participants' sociodemographic backgrounds, physical health status, psychological reactions, and QoL. We adapted 12 items from the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess the QoL. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. The median and inter-quartile range were used to describe the QoL scores. A multinomial regression analysis was computed between QoL score quartiles and associated factors, and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The results of the multinomial regression analysis demonstrated that males (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.31-2.94); participants aged 26 to 35 years (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 1.33-19.37); non-Saudi participants (OR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.06-2.57); individuals with chronic diseases (OR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.33-3.48); those who lost their job (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.04-4.57); and those with depression (OR = 5.70; 95% CI = 3.59-9.05), anxiety (OR = 5.47; 95% CI = 3.38-8.84), and stress (OR = 6.55; 95% CI = 4.01-10.70) were more likely to be in the first quartile of the QoL scores.

However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of a subset of RSV cbDVG species. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus unable to produce a subset of cbDVGs due to mutations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs originated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome determine the location of cbDVG formation and, therefore, the generation of cbDVGs is not a stochastic process. These findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.","output":"A specific sequence in the genome of respiratory syncytial virus regulates the generation of copy-back defective viral genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic in India has impacted all segments of the population but it has been particularly detrimental to the most vulnerable and has also impacted implementation of health and development projects among these populations This report describes the early impact (March-August 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic on people affected by leprosy and lymphatic filariasis (LF) and their households in an integrated WASH and NTD project in two south-eastern states in India","output":"Early impact of COVID-19: Observations from an integrated WASH and NTD project in two south-eastern states in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For broad detection of pestivirus A (bovine viral diarrhea virus 1: BVDV1) and pestivirus B (BVDV2) by a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) test, the P25 primer set was designed using nucleotide sequences of 5-UTR region of 1454 BVDVs.

Untargeted metabolomics was performed on serum samples collected from 51 healthcare workers who were in good health at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, and who were later exposed to the same risk of developing COVID-19. Half of them developed COVID-19 within three weeks of the blood collection. Our results demonstrate the presence of a specific signature associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2. Circulating monolaurin, which has well-known antiviral and antibacterial properties, was higher in protected subjects, suggesting a potential defensive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, dietary supplements could boost the immune system against this infection.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia (September 2012CJanuary 2018). We compared the demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, presenting symptoms and signs, management and clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with MERS who had diabetes compared to those with no diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if diabetes was an independent predictor of 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 350 critically ill patients with MERS, 171 (48.9%) had diabetes. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be older, and have comorbid conditions, compared to patients with no diabetes. They were more likely to present with respiratory failure requiring intubation, vasopressors, and corticosteroids. The median time to clearance of MERS-CoV RNA was similar (23 days (Q1, Q3: 17, 36) in patients with diabetes and 21.0 days (Q1, Q3: 10, 33) in patients with no diabetes).

HCW SARS-CoV-2 cases >14 days from initial dose compared to within 14 days were more often older (46 versus 38 years, p=0.007), Latinx (10% versus 8%, p=0.03), and asymptomatic (48% versus 11%, p=0.0002). SARS-CoV-2 rates among HCWs fell below those of the surrounding community, with a 18% versus 11% weekly decrease respectively (p=0.14). Comparison of 48 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from post-first dose cases did not indicate selection pressure towards known spike-antibody escape mutations. Limitations: Unable to adjust for infection risk outside of the workplace. Lack follow up on symptoms post SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Small number of vaccinated HCW cases. Conclusion: Our results indicate a positive impact of COVID-19 vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 case rates. Post-vaccination isolates did not show unusual genetic diversity or selection for mutations of concern.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine impact on rates of SARS-CoV-2 cases and post vaccination strain sequences among healthcare workers at an urban academic medical center: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In only a few months after its inception, the COVID-19 pandemic lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of patients and to the infection of millions of people on most continents, mostly in the United States and in Europe. During this crisis, it was demonstrated that a better understanding of the pathogenicity, virulence, and contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2, all of which were initially underestimated, was urgently needed. The development of diagnostic tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 or to detect anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in blood, of vaccines, and of preventive and curative treatments has been relying on intense activity of scientists in academia and industry. It is noteworthy that these scientists depend on the use of high-quality biological samples taken from positive COVID-19 patients in a manner that preserves their integrity. Given this unique and emergent situation, it was necessary to urgently establish biological collections clinically annotated for immediate development of clinical and translational research projects focusing on COVID-19 biological aspects. It is in this very specific context that biobanks must rapidly adapt their infrastructure and/or operational capacity to fulfill new critical needs.

Several publications exist, but no previous systematic review has been made to evaluate the real benefits of this approach in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an electronic search in PubMed up to March 2012 with the terms \\"single AND incision OR site OR port OR trocar AND children\\" including related articles and obtained 197 articles. After applying our inclusion criteria, 78 articles were reviewed. RESULTS We identified prospective controlled trials (n=1), case-control studies (n=12), case series (n=49), and case reports (n=16). In total, 4212 patients had been operated on by SIPES and were separated by systems: gastrointestinal (n=2888), urologic (n=390), gynecologic (n=27), other abdominal (n=874), and thoracic (n=33) procedures. The most common procedure was SIPES appendectomy, and a unique prospective controlled trial supports its safety and effectiveness. Technically demanding surgeries such as hepatojejunostomy and colonic surgeries were described. Multichannel ports and multiple ports, standard and articulated instruments, transparietal instruments, retraction sutures, and magnets were used. Operative times, length of stay, and complications similar to standard laparoscopic surgery were described. A low conversion rate (to a reduced port, standard laparoscopy and open procedures) was also mentioned. No comparable measure for pain and cosmesis assessment was used. CONCLUSIONS A wide experience in SIPES and feasibility has already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has been demonstrated to be safe and effective.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Longitudinal testing of neurocognitive and motor function using smartphone and tablet-based applications holds promise for early detection and quantification of brain white matter changes in patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and other rare demyelinating diseases, but this methodology requires validation in pediatric populations. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We developed an iPad application with a game-like interface to assess interhemispheric transfer across the corpus callosum, the brain structure where cerebral demyelinating disease typically begins in patients with ALD. Feasibility data from remote test administrations with healthy children were collected to analyze and speed and timing of finger tapping movements requiring bimanual coordination on a touchscreen. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among our pilot sample of healthy school-aged children, age-related improvements in finger tapping speed were observed in both single-hand and alternating-hand conditions. Results indicate that remote testing using iPad applications is a viable way to collect psychometric testing data rapidly in pediatric populations and is feasible during a pandemic. Next steps in this research project will be: (1) evaluating the stability of repeated test administrations (test-retest reliability), (2) assessing agreement between performance on our iPad application and validated measures of interhemispheric transfer and fine motor function, and (3) comparing performance of children with known corpus callosum white matter abnormality to performance of healthy children. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Brief neurocognitive tests that can be frequently administered may have the ability to capture subtle brain changes in developing children.

While research supports the use of many CIM therapies for symptom relief, the scope of provider-focused research on CIM remains poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES We conducted a scoping review to characterize provider-focused research on CIM in palliative care in order to map existing evidence and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS We developed a protocol outlining the study population, concept, and context; then used a validated approach per the JBI manual and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED. RESULTS We identified 34 studies that were conducted primarily in the US (n = 9) and UK (n = 6), focused mostly on nurse (n = 29) and physician (n = 22) providers, and employed questionnaires (n = 16) or qualitative (n = 15) methods. Studies investigated 58 CIM modalities, including massage (n = 13), music therapy (n = 12), and aromatherapy (n = 10), to address common symptoms including pain (n = 17), fatigue (n = 6), and nausea/vomiting (n = 6). Study outcomes included perceived benefits of CIM (n = 17) and types of CIM modalities that providers offer (n = 15). Uncommonly studied phenomena included referral patterns (n = 4), facilitators of provider recommendation of CIM (n = 3), and rates of CIM use (n = 3). CONCLUSION Provider-focused research on CIM in palliative care can expand its scope by addressing perspectives of interdisciplinary providers, examining CIM modalities that patients report using, addressing symptoms commonly encountered in palliative care, and researching provider-use-focused outcomes. We identify these possibilities for future studies in addition to opportunities for systematic investigations to enhance the safe and efficacious delivery of CIM in the palliative care setting.","output":"Characteristics of Provider-Focused Research on Complementary and Integrative Medicine in Palliative Care: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is spread through the air conditioning systems. Taking the central air conditioning system as an example, we analyze the mechanism and potential health risk of respiratory virus transmission in air-conditioned rooms and propose a method to study the risk of virus transmission in central air conditioning systems by investigating the data from medical experiments. The virus carrying capacity and the decay characteristics of indoor pathogen droplets are studied in this research. Additionally, the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the virus survival in the air or on surfaces are investigated. The removal efficiency of infectious droplet nuclei by using an air conditioning filter was then determined. Thus, the transmission risk during the operation of the centralized air conditioning system is evaluated. The results show that the indoor temperature and humidity are controlled in the range of 20C25 C and 40C70% by central air conditioning during the epidemic period, which not only benefits the health and comfort of residents, but also weakens the vitality of the virus. The larger the droplet size, the longer the viruses survive. Since the filter efficiency of the air conditioning filter increases with the increase in particle size, increasing the number of air changes of the circulating air volume can accelerate the removal of potential pathogen particles. Therefore, scientific operation of centralized air conditioning systems during the epidemic period has more advantages than disadvantages.

This study aimed to identify what the additional health-care costs of a strategic preparedness and response plan (SPRP) would be if current transmission levels are maintained in a status quo scenario, or under scenarios where transmission is increased or decreased by 50%. METHODS: The number of COVID-19 cases was projected for 73 low-income and middle-income countries for each of the three scenarios for both 4-week and 12-week timeframes, starting from June 26, 2020. An input-based approach was used to estimate the additional health-care costs associated with human resources, commodities, and capital inputs that would be accrued in implementing the SPRP. FINDINGS: The total cost estimate for the COVID-19 response in the status quo scenario was US$5245 billion over 4 weeks, at $860 per capita. For the decreased or increased transmission scenarios, the totals were $3308 billion and $6192 billion, respectively. Costs would triple under the status quo and increased transmission scenarios at 12 weeks. The costs of the decreased transmission scenario over 12 weeks was equivalent to the cost of the status quo scenario at 4 weeks. By percentage of the overall cost, case management (54%), maintaining essential services (21%), rapid response and case investigation (14%), and infection prevention and control (9%) were the main cost drivers. INTERPRETATION: The sizeable costs of a COVID-19 response in the health sector will escalate, particularly if transmission increases. Instituting early and comprehensive measures to limit the further spread of the virus will conserve resources and sustain the response.

Methods: Three groups of children were enrolled into the prospective study during January 20 to February 20, 2020 from Capital Institute of Pediatrics, including children in the exposed group with ARI and epidemiological history associated with COVID-19 from whom both pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, children in the ARI group without COVID-19 associated epidemiological history and children in the screening group for hospital admission, with neither COVID-19 associated epidemiological history nor ARI. Only nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in the ARI group and screening group. Each group is expected to include at least 30 cases. All specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by two diagnostic kits from different manufacturers. All nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for multiple respiratory pathogens, whilst the results from the ARI group were compared with that in the correspondence periods of 2019 and 2018 used by t or (2) test. Results: A total of 244 children were enrolled into three groups, including 139 males and 105 females, the age was (54) years. The test of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid were negative in all children, and high positive rates of pathogens were detected in exposed (69.4%, 25/36) and ARI (55.3%, 73/132) groups, with the highest positive rate for mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) (19.4%, 7/36 and 17.4%, 23/132, respectively), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (16.7%, 6/36 and 9.8%, 13/132, respectively). The positive rate (11.8%, 9/76) of pathogens in the screening group was low. In the same period of 2019, the positive rate of pathogens was 83.7% (77/92), with the highest rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (29.3%, 27/92), followed by influenza virus (Flu) A (H1N1) (19.6%, 18/92) and adenovirus (ADV) (14.1%, 13/92), which showed significant difference with the positive rates of the three viruses in 2020 (RSV A: (2)=27.346, P<0.01; FluA (H1N1): (2)=28.083, P<0.01; ADV: (2)=7.848, P=0.005) . In 2018, the positive rate of pathogens was 61.0% (50/82), with the highest rate for human bocavirus (HBoV) (13.4%, 11/82) and followed by ADV (11.0%, 9/82), and significant difference was shown in the positive rate of HBoV with that in 2020 ((2)=6.776, P=0.009). Conclusions: The infection rate of 2019-nCoV is low among children in Beijing with no family clustering or no close contact, even with epidemiological history. The spectrum of pathogens of ARI in children during the research period is quite different from that in the previous years when the viral infections were dominant.

Moreover, up to 63% of patients experience persistent symptoms, including fatigue, after acute illness. Endocrine systems are vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 as many glands express the ACE2 receptor, used by the SARS-CoV-2 virion for cellular access. However, the effects of COVID-19 on adrenal and thyroid gland function after acute COVID-19 remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate adrenal and thyroid gland function in COVID-19 survivors. DESIGN: A prospective, observational study was undertaken. SETTING: Clinical Research Facility, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy patients  18 years at least 3 months after diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. INTERVENTION: Participants attended a research study visit (08:00-09:30), during which a short Synacthen test (250 g IV bolus), and thyroid function assessments were performed. RESULTS: All patients had a peak cortisol 450 nmol/l after Synacthen, consistent with adequate adrenal reserve. Basal and peak serum cortisol did not differ according to disease severity or history of dexamethasone treatment during COVID-19. There was no difference in baseline or peak cortisol after Synacthen or in thyroid function tests, or thyroid status, in patients with fatigue (n=44) compared to those without (n=26). CONCLUSIONS: Adrenal and thyroid function 3 months after presentation with COVID-19 was preserved.

The objective of this study was to determine the antiviral effect of NO, produced in response to in ovo delivery of CpG DNA, against avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. We found that when CpG DNA is delivered at embryo day (ED)18 in ovo and subsequently challenged with H4N6 AIV at ED19 pre-hatch and day 1 post-hatching, CpG DNA reduces H4N6 AIV replication associated with enhanced NO production and macrophage recruitment in lungs. In vitro, we showed that NO originating from macrophages is capable of eliciting an antiviral response against H4N6 AIV infection.

After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk.","output":"A global analysis on the effect of temperature, socio-economic and environmental factors on the spread and mortality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"L-SIGN is a C-type lectin expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells involved in the capture of hepatitis C virus and trans-infection of adjacent hepatocyte cells. The neck region of L-SIGN is highly polymorphic, with three to nine tandem repeats of 23 residues. This polymorphism is associated with a number of infectious diseases, but has not been explored in HCV. We therefore investigated the impact of L-SIGN neck region length variation on the outcome of HCV infection. We studied 322 subjects, 150 patients with persistent HCV infection, 63 individuals with spontaneous clearance and 109 healthy controls. In healthy subjects, we found a total of nine genotypes, with the 7/7 genotype being the most frequent (33%) followed by the 7/6 (22.9%) and the 7/5 (18.3%). The frequencies of the alleles were as follows: 7-LSIGN (56.4%), 6-LSIGN (20.2%), 5-L-SIGN (18.3%) and 4-L-SIGN (5%). The frequency of the 7/4 genotype was higher in spontaneous resolvers (14.3%) as compared with the persistent group (4%) (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07C0.82, p 0.022). In addition, we found that 4-L-SIGN was associated with spontaneous resolution of HCV infection (OR = 0.30, 95%CI, 0.12C0.74, p 0.005). Interestingly, patients with 4-L-SIGN had lower viral loads when compared with carriers of the 5 (p 0.001), 6 (p 0.021) and 7-alleles (p 0.048). The results indicate that neck region polymorphism of L-SIGN can influence the outcome of HCV infection and the four-tandem repeat is associated with clearance of HCV infection.","output":"The allele 4 of neck region liver-lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin variant is associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus and decrease of viral loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ŀ ͷ͹״Ӧѵǰ,ҽԺԱ֪ʶ,̽Ӧ״̬ЧѵƺͲ  ԲкͿԱΪо,Kruskal-WallsǲͿݽͳƷ  ѵǰԱԿרҵ֪ʶԲ ѵ󿼺˵÷,Ҷο³ɼɳ  ڻߵнƶĶʽáֲ㡢۽ʵʲѭʽȫԱѵƺӦԲ,Ӧ״̬Ѹ١ЧİҽƻӦ¹ڷ","output":"Effect Analysis of Training of COVID-19 Coping Strategies in the Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de la COVID ha enfrentado a Atencin Primaria a un desafo excepcional, con escenarios inesperados An acostumbrados a movernos en la incertidumbre, esta situacin nos ha hecho replantearnos mltiples aspectos organizativos, asistenciales y competenciales, descubrindonos debilidades, pero tambin fortalezas y oportunidades Fue necesario reorganizarse, tomar decisiones rpidas, en un contexto de enorme estrs y preocupacin Aspectos esenciales en nuestra praxis son la comunicacin y los principios de la biotica Trasladamos a formato de guion cinematogrfico situaciones vividas con los pacientes y con nuestros propios compa?eros, en los centros de salud, en las consultas del mdico de familia, en los domicilios, para reflexionar sobre el valor de la comunicacin en el afrontamiento de las dificultades vividas en la pandemia COVID-19 Planteamos asimismo situaciones que nos enfrentaron a conflictos ticos ante la toma de decisiones de gran exigencia, en una situacin de absoluta excepcionalidad","output":"De cmo los tiempos COVID sacudieron los muros de la atencin primaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Looking back on nine years of Transfers, this essay first analyzes the journal's 141 main articles statistically, investigating whether and how much they represented the editorial team's ambition to develop New Mobility Studies guided by transmodality, transnationalism, and transdisciplinarity, in the process decentering the vehicle, the nation, and even history Together with its hundreds of Editorials, opinionated Ideas in Motion essays and book, film, and art reviews, the journal was able to carve out a clear trend toward a well-established and solid niche within the general mobility studies field Embedded in a narrative about the personal scholarly development of its first editor in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the essay shows how Transfers managed to offer its readers a hybrid mix of a scholarly vista on and over the edge of the field and an artistic, curatorial, and filmic and, in general, aesthetic struggle with mobility [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Transfers is the property of Berghahn Books and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Trending Transfers: A Decade of New Mobility Studies through the Lens of Transmodality, Transnationalism, and Transdisciplinarity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that is the cause of COVID-19 pandemic.

Rapidly evolving technologies combined with state-of-the-art data analyses open new horizons to probe brain activity, but selecting appropriate imaging modalities from the plethora of available techniques can be challenging for clinicians. This update reviews selected advances in neuroimaging that demonstrate clinical relevance and translational potential in the assessment of severely brain-injured patients with DoC. RECENT FINDINGS Magnetic resonance imaging and high-density electroencephalography provide measurements of brain connectivity between functional networks, assessments of language function, detection of covert consciousness, and prognostic markers of recovery. Positron emission tomography can identify patients with preserved brain metabolism despite clinical unresponsiveness and can measure glucose consumption rates in targeted brain regions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and near-infrared spectroscopy are noninvasive and practical tools with promising clinical applications. SUMMARY Each neuroimaging technique conveys advantages and pitfalls to assess consciousness. We recommend a multimodal approach in which complementary techniques provide diagnostic and prognostic information about brain function. Patients demonstrating neuroimaging evidence of covert consciousness may benefit from early adapted rehabilitation. Translating methodological advances to clinical care will require the implementation of recently published international guidelines and the integration of neuroimaging techniques into patient-centered decision-making algorithms.","output":"Update on neuroimaging in disorders of consciousness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by fibrosis of the skin and various internal organs.

A way to handle such spreads is through a containment strategy, where the population in the affected area is isolated until the spread has been stopped. Under such circumstances, it is important to monitor whether the mutated virus is extinct via massive testing for the virus sub-type. If successful, the strategy will lead to lower and lower numbers of the sub-type, and it will eventually die out. An important question is, for how long time one should wait to be sure the sub-type is extinct? We use a hidden Markov model for infection spread and an approximation of a two stage sampling scheme to infer the probability of extinction. The potential of the method is illustrated via a simulation study. Finally, the model is used to assess the Danish containment strategy when SARS-CoV-2 spread from mink to man during the summer of 2020, including the Cluster-5 sub-type. In order to avoid further spread and mink being a large animal virus reservoir, this situation led to the isolation of seven municipalities in the Northern part of the country, the culling of the entire Danish 17 million large mink population, and a bill to interim ban Danish mink production until the end of 2021.","output":"Mathematical modelling of SARS-CoV-2 variant outbreaks reveals their probability of extinction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Narrative medicine is a well-recognized and respected approach to care. It is now found in medical school curricula and widely implemented in practice. However, there has been no analysis of the perception and usage of narrative medicine across different medical specialties and whether there may be unique recommendations for implementation based upon specialty. The aims of this study were to explore these gaps in research. METHODS: Fifteen senior physicians who specialize in internal medicine, pediatrics, or surgery (5 physicians from each specialty) were interviewed in a semi-structured format about the utilization, benefits, drawbacks (i.e., negative consequences), and roles pertaining to narrative medicine. Qualitative content analysis of each interview was then performed. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from our analysis: roles, practice, and outcomes. Through these themes we examined the importance, utilization, barriers, benefits, and drawbacks of narrative medicine. There was consensus that narrative medicine is an important tool in primary care. Primary care physicians (general internists and general pediatricians) also believed that narrative medicine is not as important for non-primary care providers. However, non-primary care providers (surgeons) generally believed narrative medicine is valuable in their practice as well. Within specialties, providers choice of language varied when trying to obtain patients narratives, but choice in when to practice narrative medicine did not differ greatly. Among specialties, there was more variability regarding when to practice narrative medicine and what barriers were present. Primary care physicians primarily described barriers to eliciting a patients narrative to involve trust and emotional readiness, while surgeons primarily described factors involving logistics and patient data as barriers to obtaining patients narratives. There was broad agreement among specialties regarding the benefits and drawbacks of narrative medicine. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the shared and unique beliefs in different specialties about narrative medicine. It prompts important discussion around topics such as the stereotypes physicians may hold about their peers and concerns about time management. These data provide some possible ideas for crafting narrative medicine education specific to specialties as well as future directions of study.

Using various statistical indicators, the paper shows that while most countries in the region have been on a convergence path during the decade under analysis, not all succeeded in avoiding the trap. While some countries successfully implemented policies to step on the path of productivity- and innovation-led growth (Czechia, Slovenia, Estonia, and Lithuania), in several other states, growth was supported mainly by low costs and loose monetary conditions including significant transfers from the EU.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of VV-ECMO in the treatment of these patients. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases through November 2021. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the included studies were screened, and meta-analysis was performed by R software (version 4.0.2). RESULTS Forty-two studies including 2037 COVID-19 patients supported with VV-ECMO due to ARDS were identified. The pooled analysis revealed that 30-, 60-, and 90-day mortality among patients were respectively 46% (95% CI 37%-57%, I2 = 66%), 46% (95% CI 30%-70%, I2 = 93%), and 49% (95% CI 43%-58%, I2 = 52%), and the pooled incidence rate of in-hospital mortality, major bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and renal replacement therapy were respectively 35%, 39%, 11%, 40%, 15%, 21%, and 44%.

The purpose of this scoping review was to map the literature broadly related to topics relevant to women's health in MS to inform the clinical and research communities about the existing types and sources of evidence and knowledge gaps. Apart from coverage of topics within the field of women's health, we were interested in potential gaps related to geographic and racial and ethnic diversity. We also aimed to understand the degree of inclusion of women with progressive MS in this research. Methods: We searched the EMBASE and Ovid Medline databases from 1980 until November 23, 2020. We included case-control and cohort studies, clinical trials and case series published in any language, conducted in women with MS, clinically isolated syndrome, or radiologically isolated syndrome, that addressed women's health. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text reports for study inclusion, and completed data extraction. Results: Of 112,106 citations screened, 1,041 underwent full-text review and 353 met the inclusion criteria. The number of studies regarding women's health has increased exponentially over time. Almost half of the studies were conducted (at least in part) in Europe, while 21.7% were conducted in North America; only one study was conducted in Africa. Most studies did not report the race or ethnicity of their participants (n = 308, 87.2%). Among the 353 studies, 509 topics were reported as some studies addressed more than one topic. Over one-third of these focused on pregnancy (n = 201, 37.2%), followed by fetal/neonatal outcomes (14.4%) and sexual dysfunction (10%). Among the 201 studies that focused on pregnancy, only 51 (25.4%) included participants with progressive MS.

While these significant and often unavoidable disruptions have been shown to bear consequences for mental health, less attention has been devoted to behavioral changes, such as changes to sleeping or eating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their implications for emotional well-being. METHODS: We utilized data from a nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries (aged 65 and older), which was administered between June and October 2020 (n = 3,122). We examine the relationship between self-reported changes to daily behaviors (e.g., sleep, drinking alcohol, and exercise) and emotional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic) using stepwise hierarchical multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: We found that worse sleep quality, sleeping more or less, watching more television, and walking less were associated with more feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Previous research has shown a connection between the significant and often unavoidable disruptions to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., sheltering in place) and adverse mental health symptoms. Less attention has been paid to potentially modifiable behaviors, such as sleep and exercise. Our findings highlight the behavioral changes associated with adverse emotional impacts among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three main policy issues are addressed, and the results can be summarized as follows. First, age-based lockdown policies are associated with limited output losses and, therefore, are an efficient strategy to limit the spread of the virus in a pandemic, especially in presence of strong age-dependent fatality rates. Second, lockdown policies generate substantial spillover effects; hence, international policy coordination avoiding that too many countries are in lockdown contemporaneously or that such coordination takes place across the countries with the highest integration of over-60 workers along GVCs may be helpful in reducing disruptions. Third, non-targeted lockdowns are much more costly than age-based ones; therefore, other things equal, age-based policies should always be preferred to non-targeted ones. Our analysis also suggests that, in our sample, the over-60 workers are relatively more numerous in sectors where the value added and the integration in GVCs is lower; this feature should be kept in mind in the design of other policies as it might play an important role.","output":"The optimality of age-based lockdown policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 diseases have been a nationwide pandemic condition.

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower medical impact in children as compared to adults. A higher proportion of children than adults remain asymptomatic following SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease and death are also less common. This relative resistance contrasts with the high susceptibility of children to other respiratory tract infections. The mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood but could include the rapid development of a robust innate immune response. On the other hand, children develop a unique and severe complication, named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, several weeks after the onset of symptoms.

Previous research has indicated that loss of employment is associated with mental illness and increased alcohol consumption. However, no studies have explored this relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.Objective: The purpose was twofold: (1) Evaluate the association between pandemic-related employment status and alcohol consumption and (2) assess the interacting effect of depression and employment change on alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great.

Compared with open splenectomy (OS), fewer postsurgical complications and better postoperative recovery were observed, but it is contraindicated for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis owing to technical difficulties associated with splenomegaly, well-developed collateral circulation, and increased risk of bleeding. With the improvements of laparoscopic technique, the concept is changing. METHODS OS and LS performed for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis at our institution were analyzed. Relationships between postoperative increases in platelet counts, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and liver function were examined. Perioperative data of LSs were compared with those of OSs, including operative time, blood loss, excised spleen weight, complications, and hospital stays. RESULTS A total of 216 splenectomies (135 OS and 81 LS) were performed from April 1999 to March 2007. Five laparoscopic cases were converted to open surgery owing to operative bleeding or bleeding of splenic fossa. The other 76 patients were performed LSs successfully. No major operative complications occurred. There was no operative death. Excised spleen weight >400 g was present in 56% of cases in this series. At 7 days postoperatively, the platelet counts, white blood cell counts, and hemoglobin significantly increased after open and laparoscopic surgeries, and increase of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and directed bilirubin of LS were significantly different with open cases. Operation times of LS and OS were 2.9+/-0.7 hours and 2.6+/-0.6 hours, respectively. Blood losses were 150.6+/-135.4 mL and 633.8+/-340.3 mL (P<0.01), excised spleen weights were 585.7+/-184.6 g and 591.1+/-153.4 g (P>0.05), and hospital stay were 8.2+/-2.0 days and 11.9+/-3.8 days (P<0.01). Operative associated complications were noted in both LS and OS. Less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and less impairment of liver function were observed in LS than OS.

METHODS: An online survey was complete by 494 Australian participants: primary caregivers (n = 153), teachers (n = 149), allied health professionals (n = 165) and medical professionals (n = 27). RESULTS: DCD and related terms were among the least known childhood disorders. Approximately half of the sample were familiar with the term DCD but every stakeholder group were more familiar with the term dyspraxia. Allied health professionals demonstrated greater knowledge of the features of DCD, particularly motor features. Every stakeholder group showed poor recognition of the social and psychological effects of DCD. A relatively low percentage of allied health (53%) and medical (33%) professionals reported they had identified or diagnosed DCD and less than 20% of these felt that the DSM-5 contained adequate information to make a DCD diagnosis. Most teachers (82%) believed they should play a role in identifying early warning signs of this disorder, and 80% believed there are children in the school system who were labelled as lazy or defiant when they have motor skills impairments. Primary caregivers were supportive of a diagnosis of DCD being provided; however, only 16% were confident that a physician would provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Key stakeholders play a unique and important role in the identification of children with DCD.

DC. (Fabaceae) (DG) is a perennial non-climbing herb or shrub and folklore medicine, widely shows a large number of medicinal properties, as well as contains divergent bioactive compounds. Many of the herbal formulations contain this medicinal plant, which is considered as master of medicinal plant in Ayurveda. This study is an attempt to establish this plant material based on its pharmaco-chemical profiles with special reference to soil chemistry. The pharmaco-chemical features such as organoleptic, DNA sequence, physicochemical, proximate, phytochemical, UV, and FTIR profiling were carried out using standard techniques. Moreover, the ADME-PK properties of the selected molecules were established. RESULTS: The pharmaco-chemical features like organoleptic, DNA sequence, physicochemical, proximate, phytochemical, UV, and FTIR profiling, ADME-PK properties, and soil chemistry of D. gangeticum revealed its unique and diagnostic peculiarities. DNA barcoding showed that the sequence was 99.77% similar to D. gangeticum (KP094638) having 100% query coverage. The soil analysis revealed the presence of moderately high content of NPK and sufficient amount of all essential macro- and micronutrients (S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and B). The phytochemical profiling showed that the ethanolic extract of the aerial part contained glycoside, amino acid, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and coumarins, while the ethanolic root extract of the plant revealed the presence of glycoside, amino acid, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, and triterpenoids. FTIR results indicated that the plant extracts are mainly rich in phenolic derivatives. ADME-PK properties of pterocarpan such as gangetin (1a), gangetinin (1b), desmocarpin (1c), and desmodin (1d) were found to pass the Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, and Egan rules, supporting the drug-likeliness. CONCLUSION: This is the first record of pharmaco-chemical profiling of D. gangeticum along with soil chemistry, and this information helps in the proper identification and future studies on this species.

A pattern of weekly HED is most prevalent in emerging adults (i.e., age 18-25). However, rates of HED consistently decline in the mid to late twenties, referred to as 'aging out' or 'maturing out' of HED. Although many individual studies have followed changes in drinking behaviour over the transition to adulthood, there has yet to be a systematic review to identify consistent factors contributing to risk (i.e. failure to age out) and protection (i.e. successful aging out). The objective of this review will be to summarize and critically appraise the literature on factors contributing to aging out of HED among emerging adults. METHODS A systematic search of observational cohort studies following drinking behaviours in age cohorts overlapping with the emerging adulthood period will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and CINAHL. Two independent reviewers will evaluate identified studies for inclusion eligibility, extract study data, and assess the quality of included studies. Primary outcomes will be quantity/frequency of alcohol use (e.g. drinks/week) and severity of alcohol-related problems. Predictors of maturing out of HED will be reported narratively, and where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses will be conducted to provide pooled effect sizes. An evidence map will be created to characterize the overall pattern of findings. DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide a timely and warranted summary of published work contributing to understanding aging out of heavy episodic drinking. Our findings will provide critical commentary on the developmental course of HED during the transition from adolescence to adulthood and will be the first review to consider both protective and risk factors for maturing out of frequent binge drinking. By highlighting factors identifying those at-risk for prolonged heavy episodic drinking, our conclusions will have important treatment implications for primary, secondary, and tertiary intervention strategies.

Notably, it has generated several issues in the products supply and the global value chain in African countries. Besides this, Africas manufacturing value-added rate grew only 1.5 since 2018, and the foreign direct investment (FDI) from multinational enterprises (MNEs) remains very low due to high-risk factors. Most of these factors are linked to a non-optimized location selection that can adversely affect plant performance. For these reasons, supporting decision-makers in selecting the suitable country location in Africa is crucial, both for contributing to countries growth and companies performance. This research aims at presenting a comprehensive multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDM) to be used by MNEs to evaluate the best countries to develop new manufacturing settlements, highlighting the criteria that COVID-19 has impacted. Thus, it has affected countries performance, impacting the plant location selection choices. A combination of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods have also been used for comparative analysis.

Doing this without monitoring the quality of care pose risks to patient safety and may negatively affect patient outcomes. While monitoring quality of care is routine in high income countries, it is not systematically implemented in most low- and middle-income countries. In this resource scarce context there is a paucity of feasibly implementable tools to monitor quality of ICU care. Lebanon is an upper middle-income country that during the autumn and winter of 2020-21 has had increasing demands for ICU beds for COVID-19. The World Health Organisation has supported the Ministry of Public Health to increase ICU beds at public hospitals by 300% but no readily available tool to monitor the quality of ICU care was available. The aim of this study was to describe the process of rapidly developing and implementing a tool to monitor quality of ICU care at public hospitals in Lebanon. METHODS: In the midst of the escalating pandemic, we applied a systematic approach to develop a realistically implementable quality assurance tool. We conducted a literature review, held expert meetings, and did a pilot study to select among identified quality indicators for ICU care that were feasible to collect during a one-hour ICU visit. In addition, a limited set of the identified indicators that were quantifiable were specifically selected for a scoring protocol to allow comparison over time as well as between ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 44 quality indicators, that, using different methods, could be collected by an external person, were selected for the quality of care tool. Out of these 33 were included for scoring. When tested, the scores showed large difference between hospitals with low versus high resources, indicating considerable variation in quality of care. CONCLUSION: The proposed tool is a promising way to systematically assess and monitor quality of care in ICUs in the absence of more advanced and resource demanding systems. It is currently in use in Lebanon. The proposed tool may help identifying quality gaps to be targeted and can monitor progress. More studies to validate the tool is needed.","output":"Development of a Quality Assurance Tool for Intensive Care Units in Lebanon During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Post-Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome May Occur After 10% Of Acute Gastrointestinal (Gi) Infections And Can Cause Significant Long-Term Morbidity.

Methods: The pre- and post-lockdown data of 110 adults with T2D who were under regular follow up was collected by direct interview during their visit to the diabetes clinic. The variables analyzed included demographic data, HbA1c, body weight, lifestyle changes, psychosocial factors and use of technology. Result: The overall physical activity had dipped significantly accounting to lockdown restrictions and fear. Dietary adherence was better with participants exhibiting increased consumption of vegetables (80.9%), fruits (42.7%), and decreased unhealthy snacking (63%). 90% of them had access to medications during lockdown.

Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by doing the following: (1) estimating the containment delays, serial intervals, effective reproductive number (Rt), and proportion of asymptomatic cases; (2) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the containment delays and serial intervals; and (3) depicting COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings. METHODS: We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong from January-August 2020. The empirical containment delays and serial intervals were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (the percentage change in the predicted outcome from multivariable regression models relative to a predefined comparator). Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for serial intervals. RESULTS: The two epidemic waves were characterized by imported cases and clusters of local cases, respectively. Rt peaked at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 34.9% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (&#8805;80 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 containment delays (mean 5.18 [SD 3.04] days) and the 558 serial intervals (17 negative; mean 4.74 [SD 4.24] days). Containment delays decreased with involvement in a cluster (percentage contribution: 10.08%-20.73%) and case detection in the public health care sector (percentage contribution: 27.56%, 95% CI 22.52%-32.33%). Serial intervals decreased over time (6.70 days in wave 1 versus 4.35 days in wave 2) and with tertiary transmission or beyond (percentage contribution: -50.75% to -17.31%), but were lengthened by mobility (percentage contribution: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%). Households (69.9%) and social settings (20.3%) were where transmission commonly occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, the factors associated with reduced containment delays suggested government-enacted interventions were useful for achieving outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, the shorter serial intervals associated with the composite mobility index calls for empirical surveys to disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases underscore the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory. Fifth, the high proportion of transmission events occurring within the same age group supports the ban on gatherings outside of households, and underscores the need for residence-centered preventive measures.","output":"Evolving Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong From January to August 2020: Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fertility preservation represents one important goal of cancer patients management due to the high impact on health and quality of life of survivors.

Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease. RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58-81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6-24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty (&#8805; CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1-3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97-4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94-7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09-7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12-4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06-9.56). CONCLUSIONS: Around a quarter of patients admitted with COVID-19 had increased care needs at discharge. Pre-admission frailty was strongly associated with the need for an increased level of care at discharge. Our results have implications for service planning and public health policy as well as a person's functional outcome, suggesting that frailty screening should be utilised for predictive modelling and early individualised discharge planning.","output":"Increased care at discharge from COVID-19: The association between pre-admission frailty and increased care needs after hospital discharge; a multicentre European observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of face recognition systems can be negatively impacted in the presence of masks and other types of facial coverings that have become prevalent due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our model ensures texture similarity between the target and generated images via a texture co-occurrence loss while preserving the content details from the source image with a spatial self-similarity loss. Both the generated and original training images are combined to train an improved classifier that is robust against inconsistent texture bias representations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of all patients who were admitted to the emergency department due to fever and/or respiratory symptoms. CT scans were rated using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) suspicion score. True disease status (COVID-19 - positive vs. negative) was adjudicated by two independent clinicians. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and areas under the curves were calculated for inflammatory markers. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for RT-PCR, CT, and serology alone, as well as the combinations of RT-PCR+CT, RT-PCR+serology, CT+serology, and all three modalities. RESULTS: Of 221 patients with a median age of 72 years, 113 were classified as COVID-19 positive. Among 180 patients from which data on CT and RT-PCR were available, RT-PCR had the highest sensitivity to detect COVID-19 (0.87; 95%CI=0.78-0.93). Notably, the addition of CT in the analysis increased sensitivity to 0.89 (95%CI=0.8-0.94), but lowered specificity from 1 (95%CI=0.96-1) to 0.9 (95%CI=0.83-0.95). The combination of RT-PCR, CT and serology (n=60 patients with complete dataset) yielded a sensitivity of 0.83 (95%CI=0.61-0.94) and specificity of 0.86 (95%CI=0.72-0.93).

METHODS: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8C12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients.

The real incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) as a form of COVID presentation remains to be defined. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of SP in COVID-19 patients attending emergency departments (ED) differ compared to COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP? STUDY DESIGN: and methods: This case-control study retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with SP(case group) in 61 Spanish EDs(20% of Spanish EDs) and compared them with two control groups: COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP. Relative frequencies of SP were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients in the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Comparisons between cases and controls included 52 clinical, analytical and radiological characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 40 SP in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs(0.56?, 95%CI=0.40-0.76?). This relative frequency was higher than that of non-COVID patients(387/1,358,134, 0.28?, 95%CI=0.26-0.32; OR=1.93, 95%CI=1.41-2.71). The standardized incidence of SP was also higher in COVID patients (34.2 versus 8.2/100,000/year; OR=4.19, 95%CI=3.64-4.81). Compared with COVID patients without SP, COVID patients developing SP more frequently had dyspnea and chest pain, low pulsioxymetry, tachypnea and increased leukocyte count. Compared to non-COVID patients with SP, cases differed in 19 clinical variables, the most prominent being a higher frequency of dysgeusia/anosmia, headache, diarrhea, fever and lymphopenia (all with OR>10). All the outcomes measured, including in-hospital death, were worse in cases than in both control groups. INTERPRETATION: SP as a form of COVID presentation at the ED is unusual (<1? cases) but is more frequent than in the non-COVID population and could be associated with worse outcomes than SP in non-COVID patients and COVID patients without SP.","output":"Frequency, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with Covid-19: A case-control, emergency medicine-based multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct comparisons between historical and contemporary populations allow for detecting changes in genetic diversity through time and assessment of the impact of habitat fragmentation. Here, we determined the genetic architecture of both historical and modern lions to document changes in genetic diversity over the last century. We surveyed microsatellite and mitochondrial genome variation from 143 high-quality museum specimens of known provenance, allowing us to directly compare this information with data from several recently published nuclear and mitochondrial studies. Our results provide evidence for male-mediated gene flow and recent isolation of local subpopulations, likely due to habitat fragmentation. Nuclear markers showed a significant decrease in genetic diversity from the historical (HE=0.833) to the modern (HE=0.796) populations, while mitochondrial genetic diversity was maintained (Hd = 0.98 for both). While the historical population appears to have been panmictic based on nDNA data, hierarchical structure analysis identified four tiers of genetic structure in modern populations and was able to detect most sampling locations. Mitogenome analyses identified 4 clusters: Southern, Mixed, Eastern, and Western; and were consistent between modern and historically sampled haplotypes. Within the last century, habitat fragmentation caused lion subpopulations to become more geographically isolated as human expansion changed the African landscape. This resulted in an increase in fine-scale nuclear genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity as lion subpopulations became more differentiated, while mitochondrial structure and diversity were maintained over time.","output":"Spatiotemporal Genetic Diversity of Lions Reveals the Influence of Habitat Fragmentation Across Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"* Employees trust in their organization is vital during crises and disruption.

Even though challenges and opportunities of telemedicine are increasingly becoming well documented for geriatrics (such as improving access to healthcare, patient management, and education while reducing costs), there is still limited knowledge on how to better implement it in an inter-organizational context, especially when considering nursing homes. In this regard, this study aimed first to describe the telemedicine activity of nursing homes when cooperating with a general hospital; and then understand the behavioral differences amongst nursing homes while identifying critical factors when implementing a telemedicine project. We conducted a sequential, explanatory mixed-method study using quantitative then qualitative methods to better understand the results. Three years of teleconsultation data of twenty-six nursing homes (15 rural and 11 urban) conducting teleconsultations with a general hospital (Troyes Hospital, France) were included for the quantitative analysis, and eleven telemedicine project managers for the qualitative analysis. Between April 2018 and April 2021, 590 teleconsultations were conducted: 45% (n = 265) were conducted for general practice, 29% (n = 172) for wound care, 11% (n = 62) for diabetes management, 8% (n = 47) with gerontologist and 6% (n = 38) for dermatology. Rural nursing homes conducted more teleconsultations overall than urban ones (RR: 2.484; 95% CI: 1.083 to 5.518; p = 0.03) and included more teleconsultations for general practice (RR: 16.305; 95% CI: 3.505 to 73.523; p = 0.001). Our qualitative study showed that three critical factors are required for the implementation of a telemedicine project in nursing homes: (1) the motivation to perform teleconsultations (in other words, improving access to care and cooperation between professionals); (2) building a relevant telemedicine medical offer based on patients and treating physicians needs; and (3) its specific organization in terms of time and space. Our study showed different uses of teleconsultations according to the rural or urban localization of nursing homes and that telemedicine projects should be designed to consider this aspect. Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine projects in nursing homes are increasing, and observing the three critical factors presented above could be necessary to limit the failure of such projects.","output":"The Use of Telemedicine in Nursing Homes: A Mixed-Method Study to Identify Critical Factors When Connecting with a General Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality.

The mobile robot assessed in this paper includes a precise onboard LIDAR for obstacle avoidance, self-location and map creation, path-planning and path-tracking. This mobile robot has been used to develop several assistive services, but the accuracy of its path-tracking system has not been specifically evaluated until now. To this end, this paper describes the kinematics and path-planning procedure implemented in the mobile robot and empirically evaluates the accuracy of its path-tracking system that corrects the trajectory. In this paper, the information gathered by the LIDAR is registered to obtain the ground truth trajectory of the mobile robot in order to estimate the path-tracking accuracy of each experiment conducted. Circular and eight-shaped trajectories were assessed with different translational velocities. In general, the accuracy obtained in circular trajectories is within a short range, but the accuracy obtained in eight-shaped trajectories worsens as the velocity increases. In the case of the mobile robot moving at its nominal translational velocity, 0.3 m/s, the root mean square (RMS) displacement error was 0.032 m for the circular trajectory and 0.039 m for the eight-shaped trajectory; the absolute maximum displacement errors were 0.077 m and 0.088 m, with RMS errors in the angular orientation of 6.27 and 7.76, respectively.

Alongside the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway involving stepwise processing and export of pri- and pre-miRNA transcripts by the microprocessor complex, Exportin 5 and Dicer, several alternative mechanisms of miRNA production have been described. Here, we reveal that the atypical box C/D snoRNA U3, which functions as a scaffold during early ribosome assembly, is a miRNA source. We show that a unique stem-loop structure in the 5' domain of U3 is processed to form short RNA fragments that associate with Argonaute. miR-U3 production is independent of Drosha, and an increased amount of U3 in the cytoplasm in the absence of Dicer suggests that a portion of the full length snoRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is efficiently processed into miRNAs. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that miR-U3 can act as a low proficiency miRNA in vivo and our data support the 3' UTR of the sortin nexin SNX27 mRNA as an endogenous U3-derived miRNA target. We further reveal that perturbation of U3 snoRNP assembly induces miR-U3 production, highlighting potential cross-regulation of target mRNA expression and ribosome production.","output":"The human box C/D snoRNA U3 is a miRNA source and miR-U3 regulates expression of sortin nexin 27."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle-related behavior related to eating, activity and sleep pattern.

Simultaneously, rumors and misinformation about COVID-19 are still widely spreading. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation among the Yemeni population and its association with vaccine acceptance and perceptions. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in four major cities in Yemen. The constructed questionnaire consisted of four main sections (sociodemographic data, misinformation, perceptions (perceived susceptibility, severity, and worry), and vaccination acceptance evaluation). Subject recruitment and data collection were conducted online utilizing social websites and using the snowball sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using SPSS version 27. RESULTS: The total number of respondents was 484. Over 60% of them were males and had a university education. More than half had less than 100$ monthly income and were khat chewers, while only 18% were smokers. Misinformation prevalence ranged from 8.9% to 38.9%, depending on the statement being asked. Men, university education, higher income, employment, and living in urban areas were associated with a lower misinformation level (p <0.05). Statistically significant association (p <0.05) between university education, living in urban areas, and being employed with perceived susceptibility were observed. The acceptance rate was 61.2% for free vaccines, but it decreased to 43% if they had to purchase it. Females, respondents with lower monthly income, and those who believed that pharmaceutical companies made the virus for financial gains were more likely to reject the vaccination (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the acceptance rate to take a vaccine was suboptimal and significantly affected by gender, misinformation, cost, and income. Furthermore, being female, non-university educated, low-income, and living in rural areas were associated with higher susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19. These findings show a clear link between misinformation susceptibility and willingness to vaccinate.

This study showed that having preexisting comorbidity increase the odds of membership in semi-severe disease (odds ratio = 2.30) and severe disease (odds ratio = 1.60) classes compared with mild disease class. Focusing on patients who experience co-occurrence of more symptoms may be helpful in control of COVID-19.","output":"Clustering of COVID-19 Symptoms Among Iranian Patients: The Role of Preexisting Comorbidity on Latent Class Membership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the attempt to face the COVID-19 pandemic, the global scientific community has been expending great efforts to produce useful and reliable data aiming to help patients, physicians and guiding public health policies. A huge amount of information is being released every week, making impossible for a single person (or even for a research group) to read everything and get constantly updated on the scientific literature concerning COVID-19 and its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we developed PlatCOVID (www.platcovid.com), a Web platform designed to analyze, cluster, classify and discuss COVID-19 literature available on LitCovid (NCBI). Results: PlatCOVID has been created as a novel COVID-19 hub able to add features of text mining and syntax analyses methods, such as word and sentence atomization and tokenization, clusterization and classification. The main division of the literature comprehends five categories: 1) Diagnosis;2) Epidemiology;3) Clinical, Signs & Symptoms;4) Transmission;and 5) Treatment & Prevention. Consequently, it is possible to reduce the amount of text to be read with minimal loss of information, identifying target subjects by mining as new insights arise, enhancing data analysis efficiency. PlatCOVID has been designed with central panels (Gene, Drug and Tissue panels) to easily gather and share with the scientific community important COVID-19 information. Conclusions: Although most of the text mining and syntax analysis is made by using automated computing processes, the final results must to be humanly curated. With this in mind, PlatCOVID allows researchers to be part of our effort to curate, analyze, discuss and rate each matter of interest (helpus.platcovid.com). We welcome user feedback for further enhancement.","output":"PlatCOVID: A Novel Web Tool to Analyze, Curate and Share COVID-19 Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Introduction : Le premier confinement li  la pandmie  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) a eu un impact motionnel et psychosocial important sur la population fran?aise Notre tude s'interroge sur l'impact particulier ressenti par les personnes diabtiques de type 2  travers leurs changes sur les rseaux sociaux Mthode : Netnographie des perceptions et motions lies au diabte par thorisation ancre en double codage, sur les changes de deux groupes de discussion Facebook parus entre le 17 mars et le 31 mai 2020 Rsultats : 992 posts et 29 837 commentaires ont t recueillis Deux thmes, diviss en catgories, ont merg ?

We show that on average the value of a probability of a given shock is zero and, therefore, there are no reasons for a consumer to change her consumption patterns. That is, the optimal choice is constant along time. However, when there is an unexpected event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the change in the probability of the shock is not zero anymore.

The ability to prepare an alcohol-free hand sanitizer (AFHS) with antimicrobial properties is crucial, especially during pandemics, when there are high demands and a low supply chain for ethanol and isopropanol. The objective of this study was to prepare AFHS gels based on natural materials that contain essential oils (EOs) that would be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. The results showed that the organoleptic characteristics of all prepared hand sanitizer gels were considered acceptable. The pH of the formulations was slightly acidic (circa 3.9) owing to the presence of aloe vera in large proportions (90% v/v), which is known for its acidity. The spreadability for all tested formulations was in the acceptable range. The antimicrobial effectiveness test demonstrated that the prepared hand sanitizer gels had antimicrobial activities against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans yeast. The highest antibacterial effect was observed with tea tree oil hand sanitizers, which lack activity against the yeast, while clove oil hand sanitizers showed effectiveness against all microorganisms, including Candida albicans. The lavender hand sanitizer exhibited the least antimicrobial efficiency. The acceptability study on 20 human volunteers showed that the hand sanitizer gel containing 1.25% (v/v) clove oil did not produce any signs of skin irritation. This study suggested that the prepared natural hand sanitizer gel with 1.25% (v/v) clove oil can be a potential alternative to commonly used alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS).","output":"Formulation and Evaluation of Alcohol-Free Hand Sanitizer Gels to Prevent the Spread of Infections during Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the article is to justify the application of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to prevent the development of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. The results of treating and rehabilitating patients with COVID-19 and prevention of the disease using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) are evaluated. METHODS: A literature review is conducted on mechanisms of vascular homeostasis regulation, biomodulating effect of laser light, and LLLT methods for preventing endothelial dysfunction. A total of 106 patients were treated in two COVID-19 healthcare centers in Russia. 22 patients with SARS (+) pneumonia at the stage of resolving the pathological lesion were admitted to rehabilitation using pulsed IR laser. 14 patients with acute forms of COVID-19 were treated using LASMIK device: wavelength 904 nm, pulsed mode, externally and ILBI-525 (intravenous laser blood illumination) + LUVBI (ultraviolet laser blood illumination). 70 persons underwent preventive courses of noninvasive LLLT. RESULTS: It was shown that LLLT is effective in preventing the development of endothelial dysfunction. Clinical experience demonstrated good tolerability of the treatment, improvement in sputum discharge, and an improvement in overall health. The severity of general hypoxia decreased by the 5th procedure. The procedures for prevention of the disease were well tolerated; there were no cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser therapy is a justified treatment method that promotes lung tissue regeneration and mitigates the consequences of the disease. The obtained results confirm that LLLT can be used for the effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Low-Level Laser Therapy in Prevention of the Development of Endothelial Dysfunction and Clinical Experience of Treatment and Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 patients that develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \\"CARDS\\" behave differently compared to patients with classic forms of ARDS. Recently 2 CARDS phenotypes have been described, Type L and Type H. Most patients stabilize at the milder form, Type L, while an unknown subset progress to Type H, resembling full-blown ARDS. If uncorrected, phenotypic conversion can induce a rapid downward spiral towards progressive lung injury, vasoplegia, and pulmonary shrinkage, risking ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) known as the \\"VILI vortex\\". No cases of in-hospital phenotypic conversion have been reported, while ventilation strategies in these patients differ from the lung-protective approaches seen in classic ARDS. CASE REPORT A 29-year old male was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, multi-organ failure, cytokine release syndrome, and coagulopathy during his admission. He initially resembled CARDS Type L case, although refractory hypoxemia, fevers, and a high viral burden prompted conversion to Type H within 8 days. Despite ventilation strategies, neuromuscular blockade, inhalation therapy, and vitamin C, he remained asynchronous to the ventilator with volumes and pressures beyond accepted thresholds, eventually developing a fatal tension pneumothorax. CONCLUSIONS Patients that convert to Type H can quickly enter a spiral of hypoxemia, shunting, and dead-space ventilation towards full-blown ARDS. Understanding its nuances is vital to interrupting phenotypic conversion and entry into VILI vortex. Tension pneumothorax represents a poor outcome in patients with CARDS. Further research into monitoring lung dynamics, modifying ventilation strategies, and understanding response to various modes of ventilation in CARDS are required to mitigate these adverse outcomes.","output":"A 29-Year-Old Male with a Fatal Case of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) and Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women is of some importance for gynecologists, obstetricians, neonatologists and women themselves.

CONCLUSION In patients with intermittent epigastric pain and regurgitation or nausea after RYGB, the differential diagnosis should include internal herniation and cholecystitis. Besides that, incarcerated trocar site hernia should also be considered. If obstructive symptoms are lacking, this might indicate Richter's hernia or herniation of the blind loop of the jejunojejunostomy.

Globally, there are 1.5 million new cases and forty thousand visual impairment cases reported yearly. The Herpetic Eye Disease Study recommends topical antiviral as the front-line therapy for HSV keratitis. Ironically, topical eye solutions undergo rapid nasolacrimal clearance, which necessitates oral drugs but there is a catch of systemic toxicity. The hurdle of antiviral penetration to reach an effective concentration is further complicated by drugs poor permeability and complex layers of ocular barriers. In this current review, novel delivery approaches for ocular herpetic infection, including nanocarriers, prodrugs, and peptides are widely investigated, with special focus on advantages, challenges, and recent updates on in situ gelling systems of ocular HSV infections. In general congruence, the novel drug delivery systems play a vital role in prolonging the ocular drug residence time to achieve controlled release of therapeutic agents at the application site, thus allowing superior ocular bioavailability yet fewer systemic side effects.

Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages. The serum was collected from March 23 through May 12, 2020, for routine clinical testing by 2 commercial laboratory companies. Sites of collection were San Francisco Bay area, California; Connecticut; south Florida; Louisiana; Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Minnesota; Missouri; New York City metro area, New York; Philadelphia metro area, Pennsylvania; Utah; and western Washington State. Exposures Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and estimates were standardized to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). The number of infections in each site was estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations; estimated infections were compared with the number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases as of last specimen collection date. Results Serum samples were tested from 16 025 persons, 8853 (55.2%) of whom were women; 1205 (7.5%) were 18 years or younger and 5845 (36.2%) were 65 years or older. Most specimens from each site had no evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Adjusted estimates of the proportion of persons seroreactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies ranged from 1.0% in the San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) to 6.9% of persons in New York City (collected March 23-April 1). The estimated number of infections ranged from 6 to 24 times the number of reported cases; for 7 sites (Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New York City metro area, Utah, and western Washington State), an estimated greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred than the number of reported cases.

Methods: From December 2016 to December 2020, the clinical data of 19 patients with lung transplantation using ECMO during anesthesia in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 19 patients, the main diagnosis were chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in 5 cases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 6 cases, bronchiectasis in 2 cases, pneumoconiosis in 4 cases, Kartagener syndrome in 1 case, and COVID-19 with advanced pulmonary fibrosis in 1 case. A total of 9 patients used ECMO to complete the operation. ECMO was used in 2 cases before anesthesia and 7 cases received ECMO treatment after anesthesia. Among them, 5 cases were veno-venous (V-V) ECMO and 4 cases were veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO. During operation, V-A ECMO was changed to veno-artery-vein (V-A-V) ECMO in 1 case, another case used V-V plus V-A ECMO. After operation, 4 cases removed ECMO successfully and returned to the intensive care unit, and 5 cases took ECMO back to the intensive care unit.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to rapidly implement enterprise text messaging as a crisis communication intervention to deliver key COVID-related safety and practice information directly to hospital employees. METHODS: Utilizing a secure text-messaging platform already routinely used in direct patient care, we sent 140-character messages containing targeted pandemic-related updates to on-duty hospital employees three times per week for 13 weeks. This innovation was evaluated through the analysis of aggregate \\"read\\" receipts from each message. Effectiveness was assessed by rates of occupational exposures to COVID-19 and by two cross-sectional attitudinal surveys administered to all text-message recipients. RESULTS: On average, each enterprise text message was sent to 1,997 on-duty employees. Analysis of \\"read\\" receipts revealed that on average, 60% of messages were consistently read within 24 hours of delivery, 34% were read in 2 hours, and 16% were read in 10 minutes. Readership peaked and fell in the first week of messaging but remained consistent throughout the remainder of the intervention. A survey administered after 2 weeks revealed that 163 (79%) users found enterprise texts \\"valuable,\\" 152 (73%) users would recommend these texts to their colleagues, and 114 (55%) users preferred texts to email. A second survey at 9 weeks revealed that 109 (80%) users continued to find texts \\"valuable.\\" Enterprise messaging, in conjunction with the system's larger communication strategy, was associated with a decrease in median daily occupational exposure events (nine events per day premessaging versus one event per day during messaging).

Group E (S309 site)6 and F (CR3022 site)7 NAbs, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but still, a subset of NAbs are escaped by G339D, N440K, and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that single mutation tolerating NAbs could also be escaped due to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested NAbs are escaped by Omicron. Regarding NAb drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016/LY-CoV555, REGN10933/REGN10987, AZD1061/AZD8895, and BRII-196 were greatly reduced by Omicron, while VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still function at reduced efficacy. Together, data suggest Omicron would cause significant humoral immune evasion, while NAbs targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region remain most effective. Our results offer instructions for developing NAb drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.","output":"B.1.1.529 escapes the majority of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies of diverse epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota interacts with diet to affect body health throughout the life cycle. Critical periods of growth, such as infancy and puberty, are characterised by microbiota remodelling and changes in dietary habits. While the relationship between gut microbiota and growth in early life has been studied, our understanding of this relationship during puberty remains limited. Here, we describe the MIcrobiota, GROWth and Diet in peripubertal children (The MiGrowD) study, which aims to assess the tripartite growth-gut microbiota-diet relationship at puberty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The MiGrowD study will be a cross-sectional, community-based study involving children 8C12 years participating in the TARGet Kids! cohort. TARGet Kids! is a primary healthcare practice-based research network in Canada. Children will be asked to provide a stool sample, complete two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls and a pubertal self-assessment based on Tanner Stages. Anthropometry will also be conducted. The primary outcome is the association between gut microbiota composition and longitudinal growth from birth until entry into the study. Anthropometrics data from birth will be from the data collected prospectively through TARGet Kids!. Body mass index z-scores will be calculated according to WHO. The secondary outcome is the association between gut microbiota, diet and pubertal stage. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained by the Hospital for Sick Children and St. Michaels HospitalUnity Health, and the University of Toronto. Results will be disseminated in the public and academic sector, including participants, TARGet Kids! primary healthcare physicians teams, scientists via participation in the TARGet Kids! science and physician meetings, conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

MAIN METHODS: Eighty-five Gulf War veterans (21 women, mean age: 54 years, range 46C72 years) who met the Kansas GWI case definition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI), and research diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to CBT-I or monitor-only wait list control. Eight weekly sessions of individual CBT-I were administered via telephone by Ph.D. level psychologists to study participants. Outcome measures included pre-, mid-, and post-treatment assessments of GWI and insomnia symptoms, subjective sleep quality, and continuous sleep monitoring with diary. Outcomes were re-assessed 6-months post-treatment in participants randomized to CBT-I. KEY FINDINGS: Compared to wait list, CBT-I produced significant improvements in overall GWI symptom severity, individual measures of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, insomnia severity, subjective sleep quality, and sleep diary outcome measures. The beneficial effects of CBT-I on overall GWI symptom severity and most individual GWI symptom measures were maintained 6-months after treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: GWI symptoms have historically been difficult to treat. Because CBT-I, which is associated with low stigma and is increasingly readily available to veterans, improved both sleep and non-sleep symptoms of GWI, these results suggest that a comprehensive approach to the treatment of GWI should include behavioral sleep interventions.","output":"Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in veterans with gulf war illness: Results from a randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders among healthcare workers (HCW) AIMS: We evaluated the rates of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a population of HCW in the UK METHOD: An electronic survey was conducted between the 5 June 2020 and 31 July 2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations between 24 independent variables and anxiety, depressive or PTSD symptoms RESULTS: There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79 5%, median age: 42 years, interquartile range: 32-51) The rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34 3%, 31 2% and 24 5%, respectively In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio (OR) = 2 3, 95% CI 1 9-2 7, P &lt; 0 001), depression (OR = 2 5, 95% CI 2 1-3 0, P &lt; 0 001) and PTSD (OR = 2 1, 95% CI 1 7-2 5, P &lt; 0 001) The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), well-being support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with these symptoms (P &lt;= 0 001) CONCLUSIONS: We report higher rates of clinically significant mental health symptoms among hospital HCW following the initial COVID-19 pandemic peak in the UK Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk Adequate PPE availability, access to well-being support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms","output":"Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, Text4Hopea community health servicewas provided to Alberta residents. This free service aims to promote psychological resilience and alleviate pandemic-associated stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feedback, satisfaction, experience, and perceptions of Text4Hope subscribers and to examine any differences based on gender after subscribers received 6 weeks of daily supportive text messages. Additionally, this study examined subscribers anticipated receptivity to technology-based medical services that could be offered during major crises, emergencies, or pandemics. METHODS: Individuals self-subscribed to Text4Hope to receive daily supportive text messages for 3 months. Subscribers were invited to complete a web-based survey at 6 weeks postintervention to provide service satisfactionCrelated information. Overall satisfaction was assessed on a scale of 0-10, and satisfaction scores were analyzed using a related-measures t test. Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope program. Gender differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subscribers completed the baseline and 6-week surveys; 1788 (88%) were female, 219 (10.8%) were male, and 25 (1.2%) were other gender. The mean age of study participants was 44.58 years (SD 13.45 years). The mean overall satisfaction score was 8.55 (SD 1.78), suggesting high overall satisfaction with Text4Hope. The ANOVA analysis, which was conducted using the Welch test (n=1716), demonstrated that females had significantly higher mean satisfaction scores than males (8.65 vs 8.11, respectively; mean difference=0.546; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.91; P<.001) and nonsignificantly lower satisfaction scores than other gender respondents (mean difference=?0.938; 95% CI ?0.37 to 2.25; P=.15). More than 70% of subscribers agreed that Text4Hope helped them cope with stress (1334/1731, 77.1%) and anxiety (1309/1728, 75.8%), feel connected to a support system (1400/1729, 81%), manage COVID-19Crelated issues (1279/1728, 74%), and improve mental well-being (1308/1731, 75.6%). Similarly, subscribers agreed that messages were positive, affirmative, and succinct. Messages were always or often read by 97.9% (1681/1716) of respondents, and more than 20% (401/1716, 23.4%) always or often returned to messages. The majority of subscribers (1471/1666, 88.3%) read the messages and either reflected upon them or took a positive action. Subscribers welcomed almost all technology-based services as part of their health care during crisis or emergency situations. Text4Hope was perceived to be effective by many female subscribers, who reported higher satisfaction and improved coping after receiving text messages for 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents affirmed the high quality of the text messages with their positive feedback. Technology-based services can provide remotely accessible and population-level interventions that align with the recommended physical distancing practices for pandemics.

However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.","output":"Possible mechanisms responsible for acute coronary events in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This clinical case reports a Tako-Tsubo syndrome, in a 48-year-old single woman without cardiovascular history, without COVID symptoms, admitted with acute heart failure to the emergency room of the hospital of Marie-Galante (CHSM), an island of the Guadeloupe archipelago, confined due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The treatment of the congestive phase then the background outpatient treatment of the heart failure were initiated, on the spot thanks to cardiological teleconsultation (TLC) and robotized telechocardiography (TER).

The articulated arm of the robot, equipped with the echocardiography probe on its outside, is positioned on the patient's thorax by the tele-assistant nurse. The cardiologist takes the dummy probe in hand and remotely controls the robot, which reproduces the movements of his or her hand precisely and synchronously. The digital control unit and the reading of the echographic image allow him to parameterize the echocardiography in real time.

Adolescents also reported on their health behaviors, COVID-19-related negative affect, and difficulties concentrating due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Parents reported adolescents had more DIMS during COVID-19 than before COVID-19, with clinically-elevated rates increasing from 24% to 36%. Both bedtimes and waketimes shifted later during COVID-19, and adolescents reported more delayed sleep/wake behaviors. Adolescents also reported less daytime sleepiness and longer school night sleep duration during COVID-19. In considering differences between adolescents with and without ADHD, adolescents with ADHD did not experience an increase in school night sleep duration and were less likely to obtain recommended sleep duration during COVID-19.

By enhancing infectivity and evading immunity, infection with these variants might result in more severe clinical outcomes as well as being more resistant to vaccines developed on the basis of the original prototypic virus variant. One such example is the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), which has been detected in more than 100 countries and rapidly become the dominant strain in the UK in late 2020 and early 2021. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate surveillance programmes to rapidly monitor the spread of variants and to better understand the role of variants in disease outcomes and immune evasion. The nucleotide sequencing method, the gold standard of variant detection, is unsuitable as a fast-response surveillance tool by frontline diagnostic services which require detection methods with short turnaround times. We developed a screening protocol based of sequential allele-specific qPCR for detection of the N501Y mutation and H69/V70 deletion present in the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant. We tested this protocol in previously confirmed positive samples from the Pathology Dept, University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire during the second wave period in the UK (December 2020-March 2021). In these samples variant identity was confirmed by NGS sequencing via COG-UK. Our results identified increased incidence of variants containing both N501Y and {Delta}69/70 HV mutations, especially in patients admitted during January and early February 2021. This approach, which yields results within 3 hours, can be used as an initial rapid screening step with NGS as confirmatory follow-up. We also report that the increased prevalence of alpha/B.1.1.7 variant in admitted patients since mid-January 2021, a period that characterised peaked mortality rates, was associated with a sharp 2.5-fold rise in the mean circulating IL-6 level and to a lesser extent Troponin-T. More detailed biomarker analysis of a small cohort of patients (n=83), where variant status and clinical outcomes were available, demonstrated that deceased patients infected with the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant had significantly higher levels of inflammation and cell injury markers, especially IL-6 and LDH, compared to deceased patients infected with a non-alpha/B.1.1.7 variant, pointing towards a more severe inflammatory disease phenotype.

Anti-inflammatory therapies, including TNF- inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants such as the vitamin E family, nutritional intervention, physical activity, blood glucose control, and vaccination are proposed as preventive measures to minimize AD risk in COVID-19 patients. Since several risk factors for AD may converge during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurologists should be alert for potential symptoms of AD and actively implement preventive measures in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms and in high-risk patients such as the elderly.","output":"Alzheimers disease in elderly COVID-19 patients: potential mechanisms and preventive measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objectives To investigate treatment options for heterotopic ossification in the setting of COVID-19 and anticoagulation use. Design Case report. Patient followed through the entirety of inpatient acute rehabilitation. Used chart review to examine events during his intubation before coming to rehab. Setting University affiliated Acute Rehabilitation Unit. Participants Case report: 59-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation who developed heterotopic ossification (HO) after a prolonged hospitalization secondary to COVID-19. He presented to the ED with dyspnea and was noted to have bilateral pleural effusion and +SARS-CoV-2. He was admitted for COVID-19 treatment and was subsequently intubated. While intubated, he received Physical Therapy (PT) and was noted to have progressive hip pain by day 23 that interfered with PT. A CT of his abdomen and pelvis was done on day 30 of his intubation without any significant bony abnormalities. He was subsequently extubated after 43 days, stabilized, and admitted to acute rehabilitation for ICU associated weakness 15 days later. He continued to have worsening hip pain. Bilateral hip radiographs and follow up CT hips were obtained on rehabilitation day 35 (day 103 of overall hospitalization), which demonstrated Booker Grade 3 HO on the right and Booker Grade 2 on the left. Interventions A multidisciplinary approach to treatment was sought using consultants from Orthopedics, Endocrinology, Radiation Oncology, Pharmacy, and PT. Due to his anticoagulation and high risk factors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not recommended. Radiation therapy and bisphosphonates were also not recommended. His pain was controlled with acetaminophen as needed and tizanidine which allowed him to participate in therapies during his rehabilitation admission. Main Outcome Measures Radiologic images and clinical description or pain/pain control. Results Utilized a multidisciplinary approach. Care included NSAID avoidance, acetaminophen as needed, tizanidine, and PT which provided pain control without compromising coagulation status in the setting of COVID-19. Conclusions HO is a known complication in COVID-19 patients requiring extended intubation which presents unique treatment challenges related to this diagnosis.

METHODS: Sagittal reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in consecutive patients (n=581) undergoing CT scans of abdominal or lumbar regions for reasons other than low back disorders were obtained; lumbar lordosis (LL), L5-S1 angle, and sacral slope (SS) were measured. Lumbopelvic parameters in patients with or without spondylolysis were evaluated in three age groups (<50, 50-69, and &#8805;70). The influence of bilateral L5 spondylolysis (L5-lysis) and L5 vertebral slip on each lumbopelvic parameter, and correlation between cross-sectional area (CSA) of paraspinal muscles and the degree of vertebral slip were examined by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients with bilateral spondylolysis showed greater LL and SS than patients without spondylolysis. When analyzing the influence of L5-lysis, only elderly patients (&#8805;70) with L5-lysis showed significantly greater LL and SS than non-spondylolysis (non-lysis) patients. L5-lysis patients more frequently showed L5 vertebral slip than non-lysis patients and smaller L5-S1 angle was observed when L5 vertebral slip accompanied L5-lysis. The degree of vertebral slip was significantly correlated with CSA of psoas muscles, but not with CSA of paraspinal extensor muscles. CONCLUSIONS: When patients have L5-lysis, lumbar lordosis and pelvic anteversion occurred age-dependently. In elderly patients with L5-lysis, L5 vertebral slip with decrease of L5-S1 angle frequently occurs. The progression of vertebral slip was correlated with atrophy of psoas muscles, but not that of paraspinal extensor muscles.","output":"Age-specific characteristics of lumbopelvic alignment in patients with spondylolysis: how bilateral L5 spondylolysis influences lumbopelvic alignment during the aging process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a preregistered, cross-sectional study we investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19 using a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified univariate and multivariate predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (meanSD, C19+: -82.527.2 points; C19-: -59.837.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both univariate and multivariate models (ROC AUC=0.72). Additional variables provide negligible model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms (e.g., fever). Olfactory recovery within 40 days of respiratory symptom onset was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since respiratory symptom onset. We find that quantified smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19 amongst those with symptoms of respiratory illness. To aid clinicians and contact tracers in identifying individuals with a high likelihood of having COVID-19, we propose a novel 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss, the ODoR-19.

This study aimed to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns, molecular subtypes, and integron types and resistance gene cassettes in S. sonnei from Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: In total, 340 S. sonnei were collected in 2002C2011 throughout Jiangsu Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR amplification of integrons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing of cassette regions were performed. RESULTS: Resistance rates to ampicillin (67.7%), nalidixic acid (75.2%), tetracycline (73.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.7%) remained high. Strains from Centre and South Jiangsu showed higher resistance and multiresistance rates compared with the North. PFGE analysis indicated that large-scale clonal transmission among different cities occurred several times during 10 years. Among all strains, 55.9% (190/340) harboured class 1 integrons, 80.3% (273/340) harboured class 2 integrons and 49.4% (168/340) harboured an atypical class 1 integron. Resistance rates to nine antimicrobials in the class 1 integron-positive group were significantly higher than in the negative group (P < 0.05). Seven different gene cassettes were detected in class 1 integrons. The most prevalent type was aacA4CcmlA1 (114/286). Class 2 integrons carried the gene cassette array dfrA1Csat1CaadA1, and the atypical class 1 integron carried bla(OXA-30)CaadA1. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing antimicrobial resistance and significant clonal transmission of S. sonnei circulating in Jiangsu were closely related to the high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes. Long-term cross-regional monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is urgently required for S. sonnei.","output":"A 10-year surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in Shigella sonnei isolates circulating in Jiangsu Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ventilator allocation plan for a public health crisis should be developed through recognizing the values of society and engaging the general public.

In current study, we performed an integrative approach to predict antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and found nine potential antigenic sites. The predicted antigenic sites were then assessed for possible molecular similarity with other known antigens in different organisms. Out of nine sites, seven sites showed molecular similarity with 54 antigenic determinants found in twelve pathogenic bacterial species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Bacillus anthracis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Helicobacter Pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholera and Yersinia pestis), two malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi) and influenza virus A. Most of the bacterial antigens that displayed molecular similarity with antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) were toxins and virulent factors. Antigens from Mycobacterium that showed similarity were mainly involved in modulating host cell immune response and ensuring persistence and survival of pathogen in host cells. Presence of a large number of antigenic determinants, similar to those in highly pathogenic microorganisms, not merely accounts for complex etiology of the disease but also provides an explanation for observed pathophysiological complications, such as deregulated immune response, unleashed or dysregulated cytokine secretion (cytokine storm), multiple organ failure etc., that are more evident in aged and immune-compromised patients. Over-representation of antigenic determinants from Plasmodium and Mycobacterium in all antigenic sites suggests that anti-malarial and anti-TB drugs can prove to be clinical beneficial for COVID-19 treatment. Besides this, anti-leprosy, anti-lyme, anti-plague, anti-anthrax drugs/vaccine etc. are also expected to be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, individuals previously immunized/vaccinated or had previous history of malaria, tuberculosis or other disease caused by fifteen microorganisms are expected to display a considerable degree of resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to update and externally validate our previous risk prediction model for malignant esophageal lesions by redefining the predicted outcome. Methods: 15,192 individuals from the Endoscopic Screening for Esophageal Cancer in China randomized controlled trial (ESECC trial, NCT01688908) were included as the training set, and 4576 participants from another population-based esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) screening cohort (Anyang Esophageal Cancer Cohort Study, AECCS) served as the external validation set. Lesions with severe dysplasia or worse diagnosed at chromoendoscopy or identified via follow-up within 1 year after screening were defined as main outcome. Logistic regressions were applied to reconstruct the questionnaire-based prediction model using information collected before screening, with Akaike Information Criterion to determine the model structure. Findings: The final prediction model included age and its quadratic term, family history of ESCC, low body mass index (22 kg/m2), use of coal or wood as main fuel for cooking, eating rapidly, and ingestion of leftover food. The area under the curve was 077 (95% CI: 073-080) and 071 (95% CI: 065-078) in the training and validation set. When screening the top 50% or 10% of high-risk individuals within population, the detection rates can be increased in both cohorts, as compared to universal screening.

Remdesivir's pricing is based on a presumed reduction of hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. But the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) that suggested this treatment benefit excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours. Perhaps as a result, median time to recovery was unusually long in both arms of the study (15 days vs 11 days). Remdesivir requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise be discharged in fewer than 5 days may remain hospitalized to complete treatment while patients who would be discharged between 5 and 8 days, would only have potential reductions in their hospital LOS of 0-3 days. In a retrospective analysis of 1643 adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to Columbia University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April 23, 2020, median hospital LOS was 7 (3-14) days.

AIMS To evaluate the efficiency of endotherapy in the case of neoplastic BE relapse after successful complete endoscopic eradication of neoplastic BE and metaplastic BE. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records was collected in a computerized and prospective manner between 2000 and 2015, in a single tertiary care center. Recurrence was defined by histological presence of high-grade dysplasia or superficial adenocarcinoma at least 6 months after the end of successful initial endotherapy. RESULTS Eighteen patients were assessed (1F/17 M). Delay between initial treatment and relapse was 16.6 months (range 6-33). Endotherapy for relapse obtained a sustained and complete remission for 8/18 (44%) patients, with an average endoscopic follow-up of 28 months. The complication rate of endotherapy was 6%. Surgical management was required in 33% (2 pT2N0M0, 2 pTisN0M0, 1 pTm2N0M0 and 1 pTm3N0M0) and salvage radiochemotherapy in 17% (3/18). One patient treated by 6 sessions of ER was considered as a failure given the multiple sessions of endotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that length of BE (>5 cm), late stenosis adverse events and the quality of vertical margin during initial ER are predictive factors for disease-free survival (p value < 0.01, Hazard Ratio up to 0.076).

We address this problem of multi-sample network inference with a model in which each node has an associated time-varying low-dimensional latent position vector of feature data and connection probabilities are functions of these vectors. Under mild assumptions, the time-varying evolution of the constellation of latent positions exhibits low-dimensional manifold structure under a suitable notion of distance. This distance can then be approximated by a measure of separation between the networks themselves. We can then find consistent Euclidean representations for the underlying network structure, as characterized by these distances, at any given time. This permits the visualization of network evolution over time, which yields a flow in Euclidean space. Moreover, it transforms important network inference questions, such as change-point and anomaly detection, into a classically familiar setting and reveals underlying temporal dynamics of the network.

METHODS: An anonymous survey of the SCC Program Directors Society members and applicants to the 2019 (in-person) and 2020 (virtual) interview cycles was done. Demographic data and Likert scale based responses were collected using Research Electronic Data Capture. RESULTS: Fellowship and program director responses rates were 25% (137/550) and 58% (83/143), respectively. Applicants in the 2020 application cycle attended more interviews.

Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.","output":"The impacts of simultaneous disease intervention decisions on epidemic outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 pandemic progresses, severe flu seasons may happen alongside an increase in cases in cases and death of COVID-19, causing severe burdens on health care resources and public safety.

However, significant differences in the metabolome related to fatty acid metabolism, oligosaccharides, amino sugars, amino acids, vitamins and oxidative stress-related metabolites were observed when comparing milk from mothers with control infants of 1.0 kg birth weight and >1.5 kg birth weight. Understanding the functional biological features of mothers milk that may modulate infant health is important in the future of tailored nutrition and care of the preterm newborn.","output":"Untargeted Metabolomic Analysis of Human Milk from Mothers of Preterm Infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rampaging COVID-19 needs bioassaying methods of low cost and high robustness for those living in the poorly developed regions. Here, we propose such a method that does not need expensive and complicated equipment. Only a set of hand-held small devices is sufficient. A section along an optic fiber cable is stripped, so that laser light travelling through it will leak outside, while biosensing process taken place on this stripped section can form a new cladding layer of hydrogel, restoring the laser output of the fiber. A short peptide probe immobilized on the stripped section of the fiber can covalently capture a biomarker protein of SARS-Cov-2 from the serum sample. Through the cross-linking of the target protein with the interfering proteins in the serum sample, a hydrogel is covalently immobilized around the stripped section, highly resistant to detergent rinsing that is indispensable for removing nonspecific interference from the clinical sample.

Here, we meta-analyze randomized controlled trials with efficacy data (3 trials, n = 15,310) and immunogenicity data (17 trials, n = 9062).

Nevertheless, in immunologically non-naive children, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and are similarly immunogenic.

ECMO is increasingly used in COVID-19 pts with severe ARDS. ECMO has been used for ARDS due to influenza at our center in prior years. Pts on ECMO are at high risk for infections. We compared the rates of antibiotic (Ab) and antifungal (AF) use in pts on ECMO for COVID-19 vs influenza ARDS. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of pts on ECMO for COVID-19 (2020-2021) or influenza (2013-2019). Antimicrobials (Abs and AFs) were categorized as anti-MRSA, anti-pseudomonal -lactams (AP-BL), carbapenems, and new broader spectrum -lactams. We calculated total Ab and AF utilization, adjusted for ECMO duration. RESULTS: Seventy-one pts (36 COVID-19 and 35 influenza) were included. COVID-19 pts had longer ECMO duration (median: 25 vs 11 days, p=.03). 100% and 97% of pts with COVID-19 and influenza received 1 Ab, respectively, and 42% and 33% an AF, respectively. COVID-19 pts received longer duration of Abs (26 vs 10 days, p< 0.001) and but not AF. COVID-19 group (gp) were more likely to receive anti-MRSA Ab (69% vs 33%, p=.004); otherwise, there were no differences between gps in types of Abs used. When adjusted for ECMO days, COVID-19 gp received higher median number of Abs (1.23 vs 1, p=.06). Specifically, COVID-19 gp received higher median number of anti-MRSA Ab (0.2 vs 0, p=.007) and AP-BL (0.44 vs 0.28, p=.08). There was no difference in Ab-free days between gps, though the proportion of Ab-free days was lower (0.2 vs 0.36) in COVID-19 pts (p=.08). More COVID-19 pts had pathogens recovered from clinical cultures, especially S. aureus and Enterobacterales (Figure). Pathogens recovered from clinical cultures [Image: see text] Patients recovered from clinical cultures of patients with COVID-19 and Influenza ARDS requiring ECMO CONCLUSION: Among pts on ECMO, those with COVID-19 received significantly longer courses of Abs than those with influenza, even after adjusting for longer durations of ECMO. Differences were driven by receipt of anti-MRSA and AP-BLs. Recovery of pathogenic bacteria was greater in COVID-19 pts than influenza pts. Given difficulties in distinguishing pneumonia from airway colonization among ARDS pts on ECMO, development of diagnostic criteria for pt care, rational antimicrobial stewardship and further research are needed.

Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) HKU9 is an important betacoronavirus (betaCoV) that is phylogenetically affiliated with the same genus as MERS-CoV. The bat surveillance data indicated that BatCoV HKU9 has been widely spreading and circulating in bats. This highlights the necessity of characterizing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike (S) protein recognizes host receptors to mediate virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining the viral tropism and transmission capacity. In this study, the putative S RBD of BatCoV HKU9 (HKU9-RBD), which is homologous to other betaCoV RBDs that have been structurally and functionally defined, was characterized via a series of biophysical and crystallographic methods. By using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrated that HKU9-RBD binds to neither SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 nor MERS-CoV receptor CD26. We further determined the atomic structure of HKU9-RBD, which as expected is composed of a core and an external subdomain. The core subdomain fold resembles those of other betaCoV RBDs, whereas the external subdomain is structurally unique with a single helix, explaining the inability of HKU9-RBD to react with either ACE2 or CD26. Via comparison of the available RBD structures, we further proposed a homologous intersubdomain binding mode in betaCoV RBDs that anchors the external subdomain to the core subdomain. The revealed RBD features would shed light on the evolution route of betaCoV.","output":"Putative Receptor Binding Domain of Bat-Derived Coronavirus HKU9 Spike Protein: Evolution of Betacoronavirus Receptor Binding Motifs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed.

However, the impact of low-grade glioma (LGG) purity on carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. We selected 509 LGG patients with available genomic and clinical information from the TCGA database. The percentage of tumor infiltrating immune cells and the tumor purity of LGG were evaluated using the ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms. Stromal-related genes were screened through Cox regression, and protein-protein interaction analyses and survival-related genes were selected in 487 LGG patients from GEO database. Hub genes involved in LGG purity were then identified and functionally annotated using bioinformatics analyses. Prognostic implications were validated in 100 patients from an Asian real-world cohort. Elevated tumor purity burden, immune scores, and stromal scores were significantly associated with poor outcomes and increased grade in LGG patients from the TCGA cohort. In addition, CD3E was selected with the most significant prognostic value (Hazard Ratio=1.552, P<0.001). Differentially expressed genes screened according to CD3E expression were mainly involved in stromal related activities. Additionally, significantly increased CD3E expression was found in 100 LGG samples from the validation cohort compared with adjacent normal brain tissues. High CD3E expression could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for survival of LGG patients and promotes malignant cellular biological behaviors of LGG. In conclusion, tumor purity has a considerable impact on the clinical, genomic, and biological status of LGG. CD3E, the gene for novel membrane immune biomarker deeply affecting tumor purity, may help to evaluate the prognosis and develop individual immunotherapy strategies for LGG patients.

It is important to validate these algorithms in different and diverse populations to help guide risk management decisions and target vaccination and treatment programs to the most vulnerable individuals in society. OBJECTIVES: To validate externally the QCOVID risk prediction algorithm that predicts mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in the adult population of Wales, UK. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected individual-level data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The cohort included individuals aged between 19 and 100 years, living in Wales on 24(th) January 2020, registered with a SAIL-providing general practice, and followed-up to death or study end (28(th) July 2020). Demographic, primary and secondary healthcare, and dispensing data were used to derive all the predictor variables used to develop the published QCOVID algorithm. Mortality data were used to define time to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death. Performance metrics, including R(2) values (explained variation), Brier scores, and measures of discrimination and calibration were calculated for two periods (24(th) JanuaryC30(th) April 2020 and 1(st) MayC28(th) July 2020) to assess algorithm performance. RESULTS: 1,956,760 individuals were included. 1,192 (0.06%) and 610 (0.03%) COVID-19 deaths occurred in the first and second time periods, respectively. The algorithms fitted the Welsh data and population well, explaining 68.8% (95% CI: 66.9-70.4) of the variation in time to death, Harrells C statistic: 0.929 (95% CI: 0.921-0.937) and D statistic: 3.036 (95% CI: 2.913-3.159) for males in the first period. Similar results were found for females and in the second time period for both sexes.

Comparative effectiveness data in clinical practice are limited. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database, we compared survival for adult non-mechanically ventilated hospitalized COVID-19 patients between Aug-Nov 2020 and treated with RDV within 2 days of hospitalization vs. those who did not receive RDV. Preferential within-hospital propensity score matching with replacement was used. Patients were matched on baseline O(2) and 2-month admission period and were excluded if discharged within 3 days of RDV initiation (to exclude anticipated discharges/transfers within 72 hrs consistent with ACTT-1 study). Time to 14- and 28-day mortality was examined separately for patients on high-flow/non-invasive ventilation (NIV), low-flow, and no supplemental O(2) using Cox Proportional Hazards models. RESULTS: RDV patients (n=27,559) were matched to unique non-RDV patients (n=15,617) (Fig 1). The two groups were balanced; median age 66 yrs and 73% white (RDV); 68 yrs and 74% white (non-RDV), and 55% male. At baseline, 21% required high-flow O(2), 50% low-flow O(2), and 29% no O(2), overall. Mortality in RDV patients was 9.6% and 13.8% on days 14 and 28, respectively. For non-RDV patients, mortality was 14.0% and 17.3% on days 14 and 28, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to mortality are shown in Fig 2. After adjusting for baseline and clinical covariates, RDV patients on no O(2) and low-flow O(2) had a significantly lower risk of death within 14 days (no O(2), HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.570.83; low-flow, HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.590.77) and 28 days (no O(2), HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.680.94; low-flow, HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.680.86). Additionally, RDV patients on high-flow O(2)/NIV had a significantly lower risk of death within 14 days (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.700.93); but not at 28 days (Fig 3). Fig 1.

The relative expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was evaluated by q-PCR. RESULTS: We found that the relative expression of hsa-miR-31-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, and hsa-miR-126-3p was significantly decreased and the relative expression of their mRNA targets (ZMYM5, COL5A3, and CAMSAP1) was significantly increased with the increase of disease grade. Conversely, the relative expression of hsa-miR-17-3p was significantly increased and its mRNA target (DICER1) was significantly decreased with the increase of disease grade. This pattern was exactly seen during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients who did not respond to treatment. In COVID-19 patients who responded to treatment, the expression of selected miRNAs and their mRNA targets returned to the normal level. A negative significant correlation was seen between (1) the expression of hsa-miR-31-3p and ZMYM5, (2) hsa-miR-29a-3p and COL5A3, (3) hsa-miR-126-3p and CAMSAP1, and (4) hsa-miR-17-3p and DICER1 in COVID-19 patients with any grade (P < 0.05) and during hospitalization.

However, since its discovery in 2012, an effective vaccine has not been developed for it. To develop a vaccine against multiple strains of MERS-CoV, we targeted spike glycoprotein (S) using prime-boost vaccination with DNA and insect cell-expressed recombinant proteins for the receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1, S2, S&#916;TM, or S&#916;ER. Our S subunits were generated using an S sequence derived from the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain. We examined humoral and cellular immune responses of various combinations with DNA plasmids and recombinant proteins in mice. Mouse sera immunized with S&#916;ER DNA priming/S&#916;TM protein boosting showed cross-neutralization against 15 variants of S-pseudovirions and the wild-type KOR/KNIH/002 strain. In addition, these immunizations provided full protection against the KOR/KNIH/002 strain challenge in human DPP4 knock-in mice. These findings suggest that vaccination with the S subunits derived from one viral strain can provide cross-protection against variant MERS-CoV strains with mutations in S. DNA priming/protein boosting increased gamma interferon production, while protein-alone immunization did not. The RBD subunit alone was insufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the importance of structural conformation. In conclusion, heterologous DNA priming with protein boosting is an effective way to induce both neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses for MERS-CoV vaccine development. This study suggests a strategy for selecting a suitable platform for developing vaccines against MERS-CoV or other emerging coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus is an RNA virus with a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses. Therefore, a mutation in S-protein, which mediates viral infection by binding to a human cellular receptor, is expected to cause difficulties in vaccine development. Given that DNA-protein vaccines promote stronger cell-mediated immune responses than protein-only vaccination, we immunized mice with various combinations of DNA priming and protein boosting using the S-subunit sequences of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain. We demonstrated a cross-protective effect against wild-type KOR/KNIH/002, a strain with two mutations in the S amino acids, including one in its RBD. The vaccine also provided cross-neutralization against 15 different S-pseudotyped viruses. These suggested that a vaccine targeting one variant of S can provide cross-protection against multiple viral strains with mutations in S. The regimen of DNA priming/Protein boosting can be applied to the development of other coronavirus vaccines.","output":"Cross-Protection against MERS-CoV by Prime-Boost Vaccination Using Viral Spike DNA and Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early exposure to maternal depression is a key risk factor for child mental illness (MI), but there are limited programs that interrupt intergenerational transmission.

Temperature and light are the most relevant environmental factors that regulate seed dormancy and germination.

The balance between the content and sensitivity of these hormones is the key to the regulation of seed dormancy. Temperature and light tightly regulate the transcription of thousands of genes, as well as other aspects of gene expression such as mRNA splicing, translation, and stability. Chromatin remodeling determines specific transcriptional outputs, and alternative splicing leads to different outcomes and produces transcripts that encode proteins with altered or lost functions. Proper regulation of chromatin remodeling and alternative splicing may be highly relevant to seed germination. Moreover, microRNAs are also critical for the control of gene expression in seeds.

This article analyzes peer-reviewed research on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 in those with IMID. RECENT FINDINGS: Published literature on approximately 1400 patients was included from rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology. Data suggest that those who are older and have comorbidities have poorer outcomes. This is consistent with the reports from the general population of patients with COVID-19. Adjusted analyses from the largest published studies demonstrate independent effects of systemic glucocorticoids, as well as age and comorbidities with poorer COVID-19 outcomes (SECURE-IBD registry, na=a525; COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry, na=a600); biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has not been associated with more severe outcomes. These early results will require validation in population-based studies as more data becomes available.

Ultimately, this study revealed that the early upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12p40 and Interferon (IFN)- cytokine genes, which shape the antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses, retarded the decline of virus replication, and enhanced the development of lesions in the conjunctiva epithelium.","output":"Immune Responses in the Eye-Associated Lymphoid Tissues of Chickens after Ocular Inoculation with Vaccine and Virulent Strains of the Respiratory Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is first to be discovered coronavirus which is probably endemic in all regions with intensive impact on poultry production.

RESULTS: Fifty-eight differentially expressed proteins were identified. Results demonstrated that some proteins which had functions in cytoskeleton organization, anti-oxidative stress, and stress response, showed different change patterns in abundance from chicken infected with the highly virulent ck/CH/LDL/97I P(5 )strain and those given the embryo-passaged, attenuated P(115 )stain. In addition, the dynamic transcriptional alterations of 12 selected proteins were analyzed by the real-time RT-PCR, and western blot analysis confirmed the change in abundance of heat shock proteins (HSP) beta-1, annexin A2, and annexin A5.

Methods: Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics between 1997 and 2017, we identified adults starting ACEI or ARB (as an active comparator drug). We regarded prescription of ACEI or ARB as time-dependent exposure and used a Cox regression model to compare incidence of first hospitalisation with infection due to S. aureus in periods with ACEI to periods with ARB prescriptions. We repeated the analysis using control outcomes that we did not expect to be associated with use of ACEI versus ARB (Gram-negative sepsis, hip fracture and herpes zoster) and one that we did (dry cough). Results: We identified 445,341 new users of ACEI (mean age 64.014.0, male 51.7%) and 41,824 new users of ARB (mean age 64.114.0, male 45.5%). The fully adjusted hazard ratio for S. aureus infection (ACEI vs. ARB) was 1.18 (95% CI 1.10C1.27), consistent across sensitivity analyses. However, we also found associations with all control outcomes; rates of Gram-negative sepsis, hip fracture and dry cough were also increased during periods of time treated with ACEI compared to ARB while herpes zoster was more common during time treated with ARB.

Abstract Introduction Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Material and method Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","output":"Recommandations pour la prise en charge chirurgicale des cancers gyncologiques en priode de pandmie COVID-19 C Groupe FRANCOGYN pour le CNGOF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jatrorrhizine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is a bioactive metabolite in common medicinal plants, such as Berberis vernae Schneid., Tinospora sagittata (Oliv.)

Does the induction of a model of lung injury affect the expiratory time constant (E) in terms of either total duration or morphology? Does ventilation with gases of different densities alter the duration or morphology of E either before or after injury? What is the main finding and its importance? The use of sulfur hexafluoride in ventilating gas mixtures lengthens total expiratory time constants before and after lung injury compared with both nitrogen and helium mixtures. Sulfur hexafluoride mixtures also decrease the difference and variability of E between fast- and slow-emptying compartments before and after injury when compared with nitrogen and helium mixtures. Acute lung injury is characterized by regional heterogeneity of lung resistance and elastance that may lead to regional heterogeneity of expiratory time constants (E). We hypothesized that increasing airflow resistance by using inhaled sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) would lengthen time constants and decrease their heterogeneity in an experimental model of lung injury when compared with nitrogen or helium mixtures. To overcome the limitations of a single-compartment model, we employed a multisegment model of expiratory gas flow. An experimental model of lung injury was created using intratracheal injection of sodium polyacrylate in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated female Yorkshire-cross pigs (n = 7). The animals were ventilated with 50% O2 and the remaining 50% as nitrogen (N2), helium (He) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Values for E decreased with injury and were more variable after injury than before (P < 0.001). Values for E increased throughout expiration both before and after injury, and the rate of increase in E was lessened by SF6 (P < 0.001 when compared with N2 both before and after injury). Altering the inhaled gas density did not affect indices of oxygenation, dead space or shunt. The use of SF6 in ventilating gas mixtures lengthens total expiratory time constants before and after lung injury compared with both N2 and He mixtures. Importantly, SF6 mixtures also decrease the difference and variability of E between fast- and slow-emptying compartments before and after injury when compared with N2 and He mixtures.","output":"Gas density alters expiratory time constants before and after experimental lung injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Classical tests of goodness-of-fit aim to validate the conformity of a postulated model to the data under study.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative peer support system plus a supportive text messaging program on the recovery of discharged patients from acute psychiatric care. METHODS: This prospective, rater blinded, controlled observational study included 181 patients who were discharged from acute psychiatric care. Patients were randomized to one of four conditions: treatment as usual (follow-up care), daily supportive text messages only, peer support only, or peer support plus daily supportive text messages. A standardized self-report measure of recovery (Recovery Assessment Scale [RAS]) was completed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance were used to examine the changes in the RAS among the study groups and over the follow-up time points. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients completed the assessments at each time point. For the overall sample, higher scores were found for the peer support plus text message condition compared with the text message only and treatment as usual condition on several scales (ie, willingness to ask for help and personal confidence and hope) and total score on the RAS, after 6 months of intervention.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the dimensionality of the instruments and validated using confirmatory factor analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine associations between socio-demographic factors and measures of diabetes stigma. Results: In all, 2,895 participants were recruited from the general population giving a response rate of 66.2%. Factor analyses found that a one-factor model resulted in an acceptable fit for both stigma scales, which measured social distance and negative attitudes and stereotyping, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses identified Indian ethnicity (vs. Chinese), higher personal income (SGD2000 vs. < SGD 2000) and having close friends or family members who had been diagnosed with diabetes to be significantly associated with lower social distance scores while those aged 50C64 years and those with secondary and vocational education (vs. degree and above) were significantly associated with higher social distance scores.

DESIGN: Nationwide population-based cohort study. SETTING: The study used anonymised primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode Statistics secondary care data. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women eligible for pertussis (2012C2015, n=68 090) or influenza (2010/2011C2015/2016, n=152 132) vaccination in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Influenza and pertussis vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Vaccine uptake was 67.3% for pertussis and 39.1% for influenza. Uptake of both vaccines varied by region, with the lowest uptakes in London and the North East. Lower vaccine uptake was associated with greater deprivation: almost 10% lower in the most deprived quintiles compared with the least deprived for influenza (34.5% vs 44.0%), and almost 20% lower for pertussis (57.7% vs 76.0%). Lower uptake for both vaccines was also associated with non-white ethnicity (lowest among women of black ethnicity), maternal age under 20 years and a greater number of children in the household. The associations between all social factors and vaccine uptake were broadly unchanged in fully adjusted models, suggesting the social determinants of uptake were largely independent of one another. Among 3111 women vaccinated against pertussis in their first eligible pregnancy and pregnant again, 1234 (40%) were not vaccinated in their second eligible pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting promotional campaigns to pregnant women who are younger, of non-white ethnicity, with more children, living in areas of greater deprivation or the London or North East regions, has potential to reduce vaccine-preventable disease among infants and pregnant women, and to reduce health inequalities. Vaccination promotion needs to be sustained across successive pregnancies. Further research is needed into whether the effectiveness of vaccine promotion strategies may vary according to social factors.","output":"Social determinants of pertussis and influenza vaccine uptake in pregnancy: a national cohort study in England using electronic health records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the course of novel coronavirus pandemic,Shariati hospital in Tehran, as a tertiary center in both orthopedic trauma and COVID-19, we detected 7 cases with definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and concomitant emergent orthopedic problem.This paper represents considerations and special issues in managing and decision making in these patients.","output":"Novel coronavirus infection in orthopedic patients ; Report of seven cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading and mutating with increasing speed worldwide.

We assessed COVID-19 knowledge and associated factors among dental academics in 26 countries. METHODS: We invited dental academics to participate in a cross-sectional, multi-country, online survey from March to April 2020. The survey collected data on knowledge of COVID-19 regarding the mode of transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, protection, and dental treatment precautions as well as participants background variables. Multilevel linear models were used to assess the association between dental academics knowledge of COVID-19 and individual level (personal and professional) and country-level (number of COVID-19 cases/ million population) factors accounting for random variation among countries. RESULTS: Two thousand forty-five academics participated in the survey (response rate 14.3%, with 54.7% female and 67% younger than 46 years of age). The mean (SD) knowledge percent score was 73.2 (11.2) %, and the score of knowledge of symptoms was significantly lower than the score of knowledge of diagnostic methods (53.1 and 85.4%, P < 0.0001). Knowledge score was significantly higher among those living with a partner/spouse than among those living alone (regression coefficient (B) = 0.48); higher among those with PhD degrees than among those with Bachelor of Dental Science degrees (B = 0.48); higher among those seeing 21 to 30 patients daily than among those seeing no patients (B = 0.65); and higher among those from countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases/million population (B = 0.0007).

Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and ICU clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at day 15 post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. Results Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day VFDs was observed between groups (p = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm, and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm.

With an intelligent structure design and liquid metal, we demonstrated that a millimeter-scale industrial temperature sensor could be utilized for temperature sensing of micro-scale fluids. We proposed a heat transfer model based on this design, where the local correlations between the macro-scale temperature sensor and the micro-scale fluids were investigated. As a demonstration, a set of temperature-sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests were taken to show the precision of temperature control for micro-scale reagents. Comparations of theoretical and experimental data further verify the effectiveness of our heat transfer model. With the presented compensation approach, the slight fluorescent intensity changes caused by isothermal amplification polymerase chain reaction (PCR) temperature could be distinguished. For instance, the probability distribution plots of fluorescent intensity are significant from each other, even if the amplification temperature has a difference of 1 C.

We aimed to study peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients and to correlate these subsets with clinical and laboratory data, which may help in clarifying the pathogenesis to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19. METHODS: Twenty-six reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to medical history-taking and a thorough clinical examination. Laboratory tests included complete blood count, D dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT was used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subsets were compared with those in 20 healthy controls using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Leucopenia, relative neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia together with marked elevation in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were observed in our COVID-19 patients.

We performed contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography to search IPVD shunt in patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Ten patients were recruited; one patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image, and nine patients were included.

(4) Conclusions: The results suggest that the COVID-19-related lockdown experienced by urban inhabitants may have contributed to decreased brain hemodynamics, which are further related to a heightened risk of mental health disorders, such as depression or a decline in cognitive functions. Moreover, the busy City Center scenes induced a hemodynamic pattern associated with stress and anxiety, while urban green spaces did not cause such an effect.

Acellular dermal matrix has enabled single-stage ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated wounds but can be associated with higher complications and cost compared with synthetic mesh. This study evaluated the cost-utility of synthetic mesh and acellular dermal matrix for clean-contaminated ventral hernia repairs. METHODS A systematic review of articles comparing outcomes for synthetic and acellular dermal matrix repairs identified 14 ventral hernia repair-specific health states. Quality-adjusted life years were determined through Web-based visual analog scale survey of 300 nationally representative individuals. Overall expected cost and quality-adjusted life-years for ventral hernia repair were assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Synthetic mesh reinforcement had an expected cost of $15,776 and quality-adjusted life-year value gained of 21.03. Biological mesh had an expected cost of $23,844 and quality-adjusted life-year value gained of 20.94. When referencing a common baseline (do nothing), acellular dermal matrix (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 3378 ($/quality-adjusted life years)) and synthetic mesh (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 2208 ($/quality-adjusted life years)) were judged cost-effective, although synthetic mesh was more strongly favored. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis demonstrated that synthetic mesh was the preferred and most cost-effective strategy in 94 percent of simulations, supporting its overall greater cost-utility. Despite varying the willingness-to-pay threshold from $0 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, synthetic mesh remained the optimal strategy across all thresholds in sensitivity analysis.

Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance activate a fibrotic response, not only through direct stimulation of matrix synthesis by fibroblasts, but also by promoting a fibrogenic phenotype in immune and vascular cells, and possibly also by triggering epithelial and endothelial cell conversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. High glucose stimulates several fibrogenic pathways, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, stimulating neurohumoral responses, activating growth factor cascades (such as TGF-/Smad3 and PDGFs), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, generating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and stimulating the AGE-RAGE axis, and upregulating fibrogenic matricellular proteins.

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of &#8805;0.75 (&#945;=.05; power [1-?]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice. METHODS: Right atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection. Since ACEi or ARBs show no effect on ACE2 expression in the heart further support their safety.","output":"Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptorACE2 in human heart is associated with uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, and activation of the renin angiotensin system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many studies have modeled and predicted the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in the U.S. using data that begins with the first reported cases. However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. RESULTS: The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4 days. Based on the modeling result, the tipping point at which new cases will begin to decline will be on April 7th, 2020, with a peak of 32,860 new cases on that day. By the end of the epidemic, at least 792,548 (95% CI: [789,162, 795,934]) will be infected in the U.S. Based on our model, a total of 12,029 cases were not detected between January 22 (when the first case was detected in the U.S.) and April 4.

This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNF, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally.

Other factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other patient comorbidities might also play a role. Decreased flow promotes hypercoagulability. Lower pressure in the left atrium (and higher velocities in the left ventricle) can partially contribute to the higher incidence of mitral MVT versus aortic MVT.

Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This indicates that these patients seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility to and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients.

Patients had been diagnosed with OSA for at least one year, prescribed PAP therapy and had been compliant with therapy as defined by 70% use greater 4-hour for 30 days prior to their clinic visit. Using data collected from chart review as well as online ResMed AirView cloud data, we evaluated PAP on/off and average use time during shelter in place order for a 90 day period (March through May 2020). We compared this data to a similar period in the year prior. RESULTS: Average age of our study group was 58.6 years old with 19 men and 11 women. Mean AHI was 51.7. Reported average bedtime was 10:00pm with average wake time 7:30am during the shutdown compared with a bedtime of 9pm and wake up time 6:30am. Patients reported having more time to sleep and required less naps during the day. Average PAP use during shut down was 7 hours 20 minutes and average PAP use prior to shutdown was 6 hours and 50 minutes. An average of 30 additional PAP minutes was observed among patients during the shelter in place order. Only one of our patients was diagnosed with COVID during this time period. CONCLUSION: For patients with OSA on PAP therapy we observed an increase in PAP use. Among patients suddenly required to shelter in place, we observed a delayed sleep onset and wake time of more than 1 hour, resulting in a slightly longer overall PAP use time. This circadian phase shift was greater among working patients compared to retired patients. The health effects of longer PAP use and circadian phase shifting remain to be determined.

To achieve this, a llama was immunized using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an immune phage-display library of variable domains was developed. The sdAbs selected from this library segregated into five distinct sequence families. Three of these families bind to unique epitopes with high affinity, low nM to sub-nM KD, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. To further enhance the utility of these sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein, homobivalent and heterobivalent genetic fusion constructs of the three high-affinity sdAbs were prepared. The effectiveness of the sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein was evaluated using MagPlex fluid array assays, a multiplexed immunoassay on color-coded magnetic microspheres. Using the optimal bivalent pair, one immobilized on the microsphere and the other serving as the biotinylated recognition reagent, a detection limit as low as 50 pg/mL of recombinant nucleocapsid and of killed virus down to 1.28  103 pfu/mL was achieved. The sdAbs described here represent immune reagents that can be tailored to be optimized for a number of detection platforms and may one day aid in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assist in controlling the current pandemic.","output":"Single-Domain Antibodies for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organic peroxides are an important class of compounds for organic synthesis, pharmacological chemistry, materials science, and the polymer industry.

Taking a vitamin D supplement reduced the risk of having ARI. Non-ICU in-patients in our hospital with a vitamin D deficiency were supplemented with vitamin D. Methods and procedures From March to May 2020, data of non-ICU patients with Covid-19 infection were collected at discharge. Vitamin D serum levels were assessed at admission and correlated to age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), length of stay (LOS) and discharge outcome. Mean and standard deviation or percentage were calculated for all data. Results Vitamin D serum level was assessed at admission in n. 97 non-ICU patients. Most of them (80%) have a deficiency of vitamin D (< 20 ng/mL), median age is 63,7 years, 71% are men, mean BMI is 26,5, median LOS is 13,6 days (Table 1) and above 25% have a worse discharge outcome (sub-ICU, ICU or death) as shown in Table 2. Patients with a sub-obtimal vitamin D level are 14%, mostly female (64%), with a lower mean BMI (24,8), mean LOS of 15,4 days and a worse discharge outcome in 14% of cases. Only 5 patients have a sufficient vitamin D serum level, mean age of 61,2 years, mean BMI of 24,6, mean LOS of 9,2 and home discharge outcome for all of them. Conclusion Low vitamin D levels seem to correlate with a higher risk of developing the disease; supplementation of vitamin D may help in reducing the risk of ARI and improving outcome.","output":"VITAMIN D SERUM LEVELS IN HOSPITALIZED NON-ICU PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liberty-restricting measures have been implemented for centuries to limit the spread of infectious diseases. This article considers if and when it may be ethically acceptable to impose selective liberty-restricting measures in order to reduce the negative impacts of a pandemic by preventing particularly vulnerable groups of the community from contracting the disease. We argue that the commonly accepted explanation-that liberty restrictions may be justified to prevent harm to others when this is the least restrictive option-fails to adequately accommodate the complexity of the issue or the difficult choices that must be made, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce a dualist consequentialist approach, weighing utility at both a population and individual level, which may provide a better framework for considering the justification for liberty restrictions. While liberty-restricting measures may be justified on the basis of significant benefits to the population and small costs for overall utility to individuals, the question of whether it is acceptable to discriminate should be considered separately. This is because the consequentialist approach does not adequately account for the value of equality. This value may be protected through the application of an additional proportionality test. An algorithm for making decisions is proposed. Ultimately whether selective liberty-restricting measures are imposed will depend on a range of factors, including how widespread infection is in the community, the level of risk and harm a society is willing to accept, and the efficacy and cost of other mitigation options.","output":"Ethics of selective restriction of liberty in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We seek to rapidly identify, test and develop combinations of repurposed drugs to enable cost-effective treatments that reduce the risk of disease or death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesize that the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 reflects overactive host inflammatory responses to infection and is not principally due to the primary direct cellular, organ and tissue damage attributable to viral infection. Stepwise clinical development has identified the combination of High Dose (HD) famotidine and celecoxib (famcox) as a promising adjuvant anti-inflammatory protocol. We now report results from a retrospective observational comparative cohort study designed to provide an estimate of the potential benefits, risks, prognosis and diagnostic laboratory findings associated with administration of dexamethasone in addition to famcox for treatment of newly hospitalized COVID-19 disease in a community hospital setting. Study enrollment was restricted to patients at WHO 4C5. In the group receiving adjuvant treatment with famcox without dexamethasone (active control) there were no deaths during hospitalization (0/18 = 0% mortality). A total of six deaths occurred in the group receiving famcox + dexamethasone (6/21 = 29% mortality). There was a significant difference in mortality between the two groups,  2 (1, N = 43) = 7.305, p < 0.007. Median time to event for reaching WHO score of < 4 was 3.5 days in the control group (famcox (C) dex) versus 10 days for the experimental group (famcox (+) dex) P < 0.001. We conclude that use of the potent non-specific anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone in addition to the specific anti-inflammatory famcox protocol should only be considered in late stage COVID-19 disease in patients less than 70 years of age. The effects of added dexamethasone on laboratory biomarkers, and particularly on neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio raise concerns about the long-term effects of dexamethasone treatment with or without famcox during acute COVID-19 on the incidence and severity of chronic COVID (long COVID or PASC).","output":"Famotidine and Celecoxib COVID-19 Treatment Without and With Dexamethasone;Retrospective Comparison of Sequential Continuous Cohorts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus consists of single-stranded, enveloped and RNA virus, largest genome among all RNA viruses and has 4 proteins i.e. envelope, spike, nucleocapsid and membrane.

When the decision was made to reactivate the surgical practice, several major structural and operational changes were made to the regional surgical practice to optimize efficiencies. Results: The structural and operational changes implemented during reactivation resulted in improved utilization of surgical resources including improvement in OR block utilization, increased available OR time, and increased case volumes. Conclusion: Surgical and procedural leaders should consider a limited-time deferral of elective surgical cases to implement widespread OR efficiency strategies. The time selected for deferral of surgical cases should target a historically low surgical volume to minimize disruption to patient care and impact on overall OR functions.","output":"Regional Specialty Surgical Practice Efficiencies Gained as a Result of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread globally with more than 80,000 people infected, and nearly 3000 patients died.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopy in urology or gynaecology within 2 academic hospitals. Patients underwent local preoperative COVID-19 screening using a symptoms questionnaire. Patients with suspicious screening underwent coronavirus real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were excluded from robotic surgery if positive. Patients with symptoms postsurgery were systematically tested for coronavirus by RT-PCR. One-month postsurgery, all patients had a telephone consultation to evaluate COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent robotic surgery during the study period (median age: 63-years [IQR: 53-70], 1.8 male: female ratio). Oncology was the main indication for robotic surgery (na?=a?62, 91.2%) and 26 patients (38.2%) received a chest CT-scan prior to surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of no more than 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) with anosmia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study examined individuals who presented from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016, at an academic medical center in Baltimore, Maryland. Case participants were diagnosed with anosmia by board-certified otolaryngologists. Control participants were selected using the nearest neighbor matching strategy for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and date of diagnosis. Data analysis was conducted from September 2020 to March 2021. EXPOSURES: Ambient PM(2.5) levels. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Novel method to quantify ambient PM(2.5) exposure levels in patients diagnosed with anosmia compared with matched control participants. RESULTS: A total of 2690 patients were identified with a mean (SD) age of 55.3 (16.6) years. The case group included 538 patients with anosmia (20%), and the control group included 2152 matched control participants (80%).

The use of Ni as a catalyst for the steam reforming of methane has led us to look at Ni nanoclusters as potential candidates for the direct conversion of methane. Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn nanoclusters are also focused on. How the type of C1 fragments (CH4, CH3, CH2, CH, and C) stabilized by the metal nanoclusters as adsorbed species varies with metal species is theoretically investigated. The particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is based on swarm intelligence, as well as density functional theory, is used for this calculation. The Ni nanoclusters are found to preferentially adsorb C as a stable species, the Fe and the Co nanoclusters both CH and CH3, and the Cu nanoclusters CH3; the Zn nanoclusters are found not to chemisorb any C1 fragment. The methane activation capacity can be ranked in the order of Ni > Fe > Co > Cu > Zn. The highest methane activation capacity of Ni is due to the strongest covalent nature of the interaction between Ni and the adsorbed species. The ionicity of the bond between Fe and the adsorbed species is higher than that between Co and the adsorbed species, while the covalent nature of the bonds is comparable for both. The weak methane activation ability of Cu compared to Fe, Co, and Ni is found to be due to the fact that both the covalent and ionic bond strengths between Cu and the adsorbed species are weak. Zn and the adsorbed species form neither ionic nor covalent bonds. These results indicate that the Fe and the Co nanoclusters as well as the Ni may lead to the over-oxidation of methane, whereas the Zn nanoclusters cannot activate methane in the first place; therefore, their application to direct methane conversion catalysts is unlikely. Since the Cu nanoclusters do not adsorb C and CH as stable species, but CH3 stably, the Cu nanoclusters are expected to work as a catalyst for the direct conversion of methane.","output":"Bonding of C1 fragments on metal nanoclusters: a search for methane conversion catalysts with swarm intelligence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The disproportionate and growing overrepresentation of Hispanic people receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the need to focus public health prevention efforts on these communities.","output":"Increases in SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity Rates Among Hispanic People in a Northern California Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic low-grade inflammation is present in overweight and obesity, causing changes in several metabolic pathways. It impairs systemic functioning and positively feeds back the accumulation of more adipose tissue. Studies with hydrolyzed proteins and plant peptides have demonstrated a potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect of these peptides. However, it is challenging and necessary to explore the mechanism of action of such molecules because understanding their effects depends on their structural characterizations. Furthermore, the structure might also give insights into safety, efficacy and efficiency, with a view of a possible health application. Thus, the present narrative review aimed to discuss the mechanisms of action of hydrolyzed proteins and plant peptides as anti-inflammatory agents in obesity. Keywords and related terms were inserted into databases for the search. Based on the studies evaluated, these biomolecules act by different pathways, favoring the reduction of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines and the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype. Finally, as a future perspective, bioinformatics is suggested as a tool to help understand and better use these molecules considering their applicability in pre-clinical and clinical studies.","output":"Hydrolyzed Proteins and Vegetable Peptides: Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms in Obesity and Potential Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inability to communicate how infectious diseases are transmitted in human environments has triggered avoidance of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, transport in air. ERBV separates environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, allowing quantitative comparisons among situations. Particle size affects transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1, 10, and 100 m. Pathogen transport depends on both proximity and confinement. If interpersonal distancing of 2 m is maintained, then confinement, not proximity, dominates rebreathing after 10-15 min in enclosed spaces for all but 100 m particles. We analyze strategies to reduce this confinement effect. Ventilation and filtration reduce person-to-person transport of 1 m particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and office situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10 and 100 m particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Prior knowledge of size-dependent ERBV would help identify transmission modes and effective interventions. This framework supports mitigation decisions in emerging situations, even before other infectious parameters are known.","output":"Quantifying Proximity, Confinement, and Interventions in Disease Outbreaks: A Decision Support Framework for Air-Transported Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The zoonotic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recently appeared as a global health threat that can cause severe respiratory infection and terminal respiratory distress.

This article describes the evolution of LRDI by the author and the insights gained/lessons learned over the past decade. To illustrate the potential power of LRDI, the article emphasizes the relationship between the results of our 2008 LRDI multiple sclerosis (MS) study and a recent demonstration of MS reversal. Lessons learned from the six LRDI medical studies done so far include: ?. The main operational problem in the author's LRDI approach is selecting the most important concepts from extremely large volumes of potential discovery retrieval. This is contrary to most published LRDI research, where the discovery focus is searching for rare events. ?. It is important to have topical specialist(s) working closely with information technologist(s); the topical specialist(s) applies judgment in selecting the most important concepts. ?. A functional form of the information retrieval query with proximity searching capability provides highly selective filtering for discovery retrieval and core prevention/treatment retrieval; the functional form of the query with proximity searching capability allows the use of full-text for discovery and core prevention/treatment. ?. Bibliographic coupling (identifying papers that share common references) combined with text-based relationships strengthens selection for potential discovery further. ?. Having skin-in-the-game (being affected personally) relative to the medical outcome is a strong incentive to do whatever is necessary to solve the research problem. ?. Hormesis is critical to healing; relatively modest doses of stimuli tend to be beneficial, whereas relatively large doses may be harmful. The synergy of hormetic treatment doses produces effects larger than combinations of individual doses and requires smaller doses when combined; the synergy of hormetic doses allows conversion of megadoses of nutrients typically reported in lab/clinical studies to physiological (food-level) doses and associated increased safety. ?. Co-promoters (combinations of toxic stimuli required to produce disease symptoms) are extremely important for explaining seemingly conflicting results; if true co-promotion is present, elimination of one of the co-promoters may be adequate for removing symptoms, even though the overall problem persists. ?. Prior art (potential treatments already published in the literature but not pursued by mainline medicine) may have much to contribute to potentially solve many serious medical problems; much of prior art is overlooked, especially low-tech prior art (e.g., foods, food extracts, herbs, etc.). ?. Systemic and focused treatments are both necessary components of healing, but neither will be fully, or many times even partially, effective until the cause(s) is identified and removed. Any medical approach that involves administering treatments for chronic and infectious diseases without addressing the cause(s) results in a broad range of outcomes mainly involving substitution of one set of symptoms for another. ?. Past results of LRDI medical studies showed much overlap among preventatives/systemic treatments for different diseases. Differences will arise mainly in focused treatments, especially those involving high technology. ?. The central parameters to healing in much medical research are never identified nor reported. Many treatments require a combination of skilled practitioners, cause removal, and immune/neural/endocrine/circulatory systems to be healthy for full effectiveness, yet practitioner skill, degree of cause removal, and immune system et al. health are never reported. A lack of this information does not allow efficacy of different treatments to be compared. Reviews and meta-analyses that compare and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these different treatments without the above critical information being reported are of extremely limited value and credibility. ?. Finally, the most important deficiency for fully reversing chronic and infectious diseases, as well as rapidly accelerating healing of injuries and wounds, is the credibility and integrity of the medical literature itself, especially in areas that concern commercial and government/political sensitivities. In the evaluation of many concepts that deviated from the norm, it was difficult to ascertain whether the difference was based on solid high-quality research, poor research, or deliberately skewed research.","output":"Literature-related discovery and innovation  update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to clarify the association between frailty and changes in lifestyle and physical or psychological conditions among community-dwelling older adults affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 countermeasures in Japan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between 8 May and 12 June 2020 in Japan. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed among 1353 older adults. To assess frailty, we used the frailty screening index. To assess changes in lifestyle and physical or psychological conditions, we developed the Questionnaire for Change of Life (QCL), which comprised five items related to frailty. Cronbach's &#945; was calculated as a measure of internal consistency of QCL. We compared the score for each item in the QCL between the frailty and non-frailty groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to show the factors that affect frailty status. RESULTS: In total, 856 older adults (63.3%) were analyzed. A total of 83 participants (9.7%) had frailty, and 755 participants (90.3%) had non-frailty. Cronbach's &#945; for QCL was 0.552. We observed a significant decrease in daily movement, leg muscle strength and meal size among older adults with frailty compared with non-frailty (P < 0.001). Subjective leg muscle strength (odds ratio 3.257, 95% confidence interval 2.236-4.746) was negatively correlated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that each individual QCL item should be used in analyses involving the QCL. This report showed that subjective lifestyle changes affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 countermeasures were associated with frailty status. In particular, as older adults were aware of a decrease in their leg muscle strength, they were significantly more frail.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while the evidence is still limited. Methods We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality [risk ratio (RR) =2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69 to 5.75, I2=90.9%] or the duration of lung inflammation [weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91], while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD =-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR =1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD =0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD =0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids to treat COVID-19: a rapid review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of infections worldwide. While the search for an effective antiviral is still ongoing, experimental therapies based on repurposing of available antivirals is being attempted, of which HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have gained considerable interest. Inhibition profiling of the PIs directly against the viral protease has never been attempted in vitro, and while few studies reported an efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 context, the mechanism of action of the drugs remains to be validated. METHODS: We carried out an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of HIV PIs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) in cell culture and in vitro enzymatic assays, using a methodology that enabled us to focus solely on any potential inhibitory effects of the inhibitors against the viral protease. For cell culture experiments a dark-to-bright GFP reporter substrate system was designed. RESULTS: Lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, saquinavir, and atazanavir were able to inhibit the viral protease in cell culture, albeit in concentrations much higher than their achievable plasma levels, given their current drug formulations. While inhibition by lopinavir was attributed to its cytotoxicity, ritonavir was the most effective of the panel, with IC50 of 13.7 M. None of the inhibitors showed significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in our in vitro enzymatic assays up to 100 M concentration. CONCLUSION: Targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by some of the HIV PIs might be of limited clinical potential, given the high concentration of the drugs required to achieve significant inhibition. Therefore, given their weak inhibition of the viral protease, any potential beneficial effect of the PIs in COVID-19 context might perhaps be attributed to acting on other molecular target(s), rather than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Analysis of the efficacy of HIV protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2's main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To better understand the different clinical phenotypes across the disease spectrum in patients with COVID-19 using an unsupervised machine learning clustering approach.

Better risk prediction during hospitalization could improve management and ultimately reduce mortality rates. AIM To evaluate CRP measured at admission and the third day of hospitalization as a predictor for adverse events in CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP at an academic hospital. Major adverse outcomes were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital length of stay, hospital complications and 30-day mortality. Predictive associations between CRP (as absolute levels and relative decline at third day) and adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS Eight hundred and twenty-three patients were assessed, 19% were admitted to ICU and 10.6% required mechanical ventilation. The average hospital stay was 8.8  8.2 days, 42% had nosocomial complications and 8.1% died within 30 days. Ninety eight percent of patients had elevated serum CRP on admission to the hospital (18.1  14.1 mg/dL). C-reactive protein measured at admission was associated with the risk of bacterial pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, septic shock and use of mechanical ventilation. Lack of CRP decline within three days of hospitalization was associated with high risk of complications, septic shock, mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay.

Therefore, in this study comparative methods have been used for receptor-based virtual screening, targeting 9 selected structures of viral Mpro. Reliability analyses followed by re-docking of the specific co-crystallized ligand provided the best reproductivity for structures with PDB ID 6LU7, 6Y2G and 6Y2F. The influence of crystallographic water on an outcome of a virtual screening against selected targets was also investigated. Once the most reliable targets were selected, the library of easy purchasable natural compounds were retrieved from the MolPort database (10,305 compounds) and docked against the selected Mpro proteins. To ensure the efficiency of the selected compounds, binding energies for top-15 hit ligands were calculated using Molecular Mechanics as well as their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties were predicted.

Data from March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data. Results: : European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032).

However, many patients are unable to tolerate resection secondary to poor reserve or comorbid disease. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are methods of percutaneous thermal ablation that can be used to treat medically inoperable patients with NSCLC. We present long-term outcomes following thermal ablation of stage IA NSCLC from a single center. Methods Patients with stage IA NSCLC and factors precluding resection who underwent RFA or MWA from July 2005 to September 2009 were studied. CT and PET-CT scans were performed at 3 and 6 month intervals, respectively, for first 24 months of follow-up. Factors associated with local progression (LP) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results Twenty-one patients underwent 21 RFA and 4 MWA for a total of 25 ablations. Fifteen patients had T1a and six patients had T1b tumors. Mean follow-up was 42 months, median survival was 39 months, and OS at three years was 52%. There was no significant difference in median survival between T1a nodules and T1b nodules (36 vs. 39 months, P=0.29) or for RFA and MWA (36 vs. 50 months, P=0.80). Ten patients had LP (47.6%), at a median time of 35 months. There was no significant difference in LP between T1a and T1b tumors (22 vs. 35 months, P=0.94) or RFA and MWA (35 vs. 17 months, P=0.18).

CONCLUSION Both Eugen Holl?nder and Erich Lexer performed, independently from another, the first facelifts in Germany. Hereby, their operative approach was different. In contrast to Holl?nder who only performed skin resections for a better tightening of the face, Lexer undermined the skin in an area of multiple centimetres.Even in their suture technique the difference was visible. Lexer for instance conducted a special suture technique by including the fascia temporalis superficialis in his sutures for achieving lasting stability and tension relief.

These diseases, known as zoonoses, represent 75% of new or reemerging infectious diseases. There is a considerable impact of these diseases on the economy and health at local and global levels, including zoonotic diseases caused by the ingestion of food and products derived from animals. The wide range of animal species that host these disease-causing organisms include all groups of mammals. Birds are the second significant animal group to act as hosts for zoonoses. Much progress has been made in understanding disease evolution and animal origin, with important contributions from fields such as paleopathology and analysis of DNA, applied to ancient human bone remains. The study of ancient diseases such as brucellosis and tuberculosis benefits from these approaches. More research is needed as new diseases emerge causing pandemics and some previously eradicated reemerge in some regions. Global efforts are focused, based on evidence generated by research, on the prevention of new pandemics. ABSTRACT: Bacterial, viral, and parasitic zoonotic diseases are transmitted to humans from a wide variety of animal species that act as reservoir hosts for the causative organisms. Zoonoses contribute an estimated 75% of new or reemerging infectious diseases in humans. All groups of mammals have been shown to act as hosts for transmission of different organisms that cause zoonoses, followed in importance by birds; with both wild and domestic species identified as hosts in specific cases. There has been considerable research progress leading to a better understanding of the host range, animal origin, evolution, and transmission of important zoonoses, including those caused by the ingestion of food and products derived from animals. Paleopathology studies of ancient human bone lesions, in combination with ancient DNA analysis of the causative pathogen, have contributed to our understanding of the origin of zoonotic diseases, including brucellosis and mycobacterial zoonoses. However, there are still knowledge gaps and new confirmed and potential hosts are reported locally with some frequency. Both the economic cost and burden of disease of zoonoses are substantial at local and global levels, as reflected by recent coronavirus pandemics that spread rapidly around the world. Evidence-based prevention strategies are currently a global priority increasingly recognized, especially in zoonoses-affected regions.","output":"Host Diversity and Origin of Zoonoses: The Ancient and the New"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A new coronavirus disease in humans, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019.

Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship (all P values for linear trend <0.001), and more than offset benefits from social assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Even after accounting for social assistance receipt, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater risks of anxiety and depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. These findings point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance to mitigate the pandemic's adverse impacts on the well-being of millions of Americans, including vulnerable minority and low-income populations.","output":"Financial hardship and social assistance as determinants of mental health and food and housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive complaints are common in patients recovering from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet their etiology is often unclear. We assess factors that contribute to cognitive impairment in ambulatory versus hospitalized patients during the sub-acute stage of recovery. METHODS: Participants were prospectively recruited from a hospital-wide registry. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Patients  18 years-of-age and those with a pre-existing major neurocognitive disorder were excluded. Participants completed an extensive neuropsychological questionnaire and a computerized cognitive screen via remote telemedicine platform. Rates of subjective and objective neuropsychological impairment were compared between the ambulatory and hospitalized groups. Factors associated with impairment were explored separately within each group. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients (76 ambulatory, 26 hospitalized) completed the symptom inventory and neurocognitive tests 24  22 days following laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients self-reported high rates of cognitive impairment (27-40%), without differences between the groups. However, hospitalized patients showed higher rates of objective impairment in visual memory (30% vs. 4%; p=0.001) and psychomotor speed (41% vs. 15%; p=0.008). Objective cognitive test performance was associated with anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain in the ambulatory but not the hospitalized group. CONCLUSIONS: Focal cognitive deficits are more common in hospitalized than ambulatory patients. Cognitive performance is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in ambulatory but not hospitalized patients.

In a number of countries, hanging mortality has increased over the last decades. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies that have explored the patterns and trends for mortality of suicide by hanging on global, regional and national levels, as most evaluations are limited to certain populations. AIM: To assess the trends of suicide mortality by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation in Serbia, from 1991 to 2020. METHODS: This nationwide study, with epidemiological descriptive study design, was carried out based on official data. The age-standardized rates (ASRs, expressed per 100000 persons) were calculated by direct standardization, using the World Standard Population. Mortality trends from suicide by hanging were assessed using the joinpoint regression analysis: The average annual percent change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. Age-period-cohort analysis was performed to address the possible underlying reasons for the observed suicide trends. RESULTS: Over the 30-year period studied, there were 24340 deaths by hanging (17750 males and 6590 females) in Serbia. In 2020, the ASR of deaths by hanging was 4.5 per 100000 persons in both sexes together (7.6 in males vs 1.7 in females). The trends of suicide mortality by hanging decreased significantly between 1991 and 2020 in both males (AAPC = -1.7% per year; 95%CI: -2.0 to -1.4) and females (AAPC = - 3.5% per year; 95%CI: -3.9 to -3.1). Mortality rates of suicide by hanging had a continuously decreasing tendency in both sexes together in all age groups: The only exception was among males in 40-49 age group, with an increasing trend of suicide by hanging from 1991 to 2011 (by +0.3% per year). CONCLUSION: The trends in suicide mortality by hanging have been decreasing in Serbia in the last three decades in both sexes, but this was more pronounced in women than in men. Despite the decreasing trends observed in mortality of suicide by hanging, further research is needed for better clarification of trends and help in suicide prevention in the future.","output":"Trends in suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation in Serbia, 1991-2020: A joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depression among college students is very common College students are special groups that are in transition from adolescence to adulthood that can create stress in one's life College students try to fit in, make plans for the future, and being away from home often causes anxiety and results in depression for college students In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, students felt bored at home, did not understand material optimally, were confused with online learning methods, and felt their abilities and grades dropped dramatically This study aims to determine the level of student depression during the COVID-19 pandemic The quantitative research with a descriptive analytic approach The research sample was 147 students, the study was conducted in May 2020 on the students of Akper Dharma Wacana The research instrument used the BDI II questionnaire Data were analyzed univariately with a frequency distribution The results showed that 21 1% of students had mild depression, 17% of students had moderate depression and 3 4% had severe depression","output":"Depression Among College Students Due To The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of new viruses and resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms has become a powerful stimulus in the search for new drugs.

Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms that determine the antiviral effect of nucleoside analogs containing hydrophobic fragments. Depending on the structure and position of the hydrophobic substituent, such nucleosides can either block the process of penetration of viruses into cells or inhibit the stage of genome replication. The mechanisms of inhibition of viral enzymes by compounds of nucleoside and non-nucleoside nature have been compared. The stages of creation of antiparasitic drugs, which are based on the peculiarities of metabolic transformations of nucleosides in humans body and parasites, have been considered. A new approach to the creation of drugs is described, based on the use of prodrugs of modified nucleosides, which, as a result of metabolic processes, are converted into an effective drug directly in the target organ or tissue.

Yet, little is known about getting out in this population. Here, our objectives are to: 1) identify residents' opportunities for, and experiences with, getting out; 2) understand the significance of getting out; and 3) explain influential factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Guided by grounded theory methods, we analyzed qualitative data collected over a one-year period in four diverse assisted living communities. We followed 33 residents with dementia and their care partners. Data include detailed fieldnotes capturing 1,560 observation hours, 114 interviews with residents (where possible), assisted living staff, family members, and other visitors, and record review. RESULTS: We identified the centrality of \\"being out in the world and negotiating connections,\\" which characterizes residents' experiences with the outside world as a process of 'working out' engagement with nature, others, and the community. Being out in the world was consequential to well-being and quality of life. Most residents got out at least occasionally; some lacked opportunities. Among residents who got out, most benefitted from ensuing connections. Yet, not all experiences were positive. Being out in the world varied over time and by individual-, convoy-, AL community-, and neighborhood-level factors.

Design: LIVE-AIR was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized 1:1 and stratified according to age and disease severity, to receive lenzilumab or placebo on Day 0, were followed through Day 28. Setting: Secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the US and Brazil. Participants: 520 hospitalized COVID-19 participants with SpO2[]94% on room air or required supplemental oxygen but not invasive mechanical ventilation were included. Interventions: Lenzilumab (1800mg; divided as 3 doses, q8h) or placebo infusion alongside standard treatments including corticosteroids and remdesivir. Main outcome measures: A multi-variate logistic regression analysis assessed key baseline risk factors for progression to IMV or death. The primary endpoint, SWOV, and key secondary endpoints were analyzed according to baseline CRP levels in all participants with CRP values. Results: The multi-variate analysis demonstrated that elevated baseline plasma CRP was the most predictive feature for progression to IMV or death. SWOV was achieved in 152 (90%; 95%CI: 85to 94) lenzilumab and 183 (79%; 72 to 84) placebo participants with baseline CRP<150 mg/L and its likelihood was greater with lenzilumab than placebo (HR: 2.54; 95%CI, 1.46 to 4.41; p=0.0009) but not in participants with CRP[]150 mg/L at baseline.

METHODS: The study uses data collected in phases 5 to 8 of Epicovid-19-RS. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by a rapid test. The occurrence of cough, fever, palpitations, sore throat, difficulty breathing, changes in taste and smell, vomiting, diarrhea, body pain, shaking, and headache since March 2020 was also evaluated. Then, the capability to predict the evaluated symptoms concerning the presence of antibodies was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 18,000 individuals were interviewed and 181 had antibodies against COVID-19 in phases 5 to 8. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals was 19.9% among participants with antibodies and 49.7% among those without antibodies. All symptoms were reported more frequently by individuals with antibodies. The division of the prevalence of symptoms among individuals with antibodies by the prevalence among individuals without antibodies showed the following prevalence ratios: for changes in smell or taste (9.1), fever (4.2), tremors (3.9), breathing difficulty (3.2) and cough (2.8 times).

Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated. RESULTS In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.96.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.140.77 g/dL and 8.87 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients. CONCLUSION Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided.

This manuscript presents a novel method that predicts whether a patient will need admission to the ICU and assess the risk of in-hospital mortality by training a deep learning model that combines a set of clinical variables and features in the Chest-X-Rays. METHODS: This was a prospective diagnostic test study. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 were included. This study was designed to build predictive models obtained by training convolutional neural networks for Chest-X-ray images using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool and a Random Forest analysis to identify critical clinical variables. Then, both architectures were connected and fine-tuned to provide combined models. RESULTS: A total of 2552 patients were included in the clinical cohort. The variables independently associated with ICU admission were age, the fraction of inspired oxygen - FiO2 on admission, dyspnoea on admission, and obesity. Moreover, the variables associated with hospital mortality were age, the fraction of inspired oxygen - FiO2 on admission, and dyspnoea. When implementing the AI model to interpret the Chest-X-rays and the clinical variable identified by random forest, we developed a model that accurately predicts ICU admission (AUC:0.920.04) and hospital mortality (AUC:0.810.06) in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

The targeted group was 22 096 children aged 13 years and below. RESULTS: Polio SIAs in Penampang managed to achieve more than 90% coverage for both bOPV and mOPV. The overall vaccine wastage was reported to be 1.63%. No major adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSION: High vaccine uptake during Polio SIAs in Penampang was attributed to good inter-agency collaboration, community engagement, intensified health promotion activities, and drive-through vaccination campaign.","output":"Polio Supplementary Immunization Activities During COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience from Penampang District, Sabah, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de la infeccin por el coronavirus tipo 2 del sndrome respiratorio agudo grave o SARS-CoV-2 causante de la enfermedad por coronavirus de 2019 (COVID-19) ha precisado de una transformacin drstica de los hospitales y por consiguiente de los servicios de Nefrologa de Espa?a.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has required a rapid and drastic transformation of hospitals, and consequently also of Spanish Nephrology Units, to respond to the critical situation. The Spanish Society of Nephrology conducted a survey directed to the Heads of Nephrology Departments in Spain that addressed the reorganisation of Nephrology departments and activity during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The survey focused on the integration of nephrologists in COVID-19 teams, nephrology inpatient care activities (elective admissions, kidney biopsies), the performance of elective surgeries such as vascular accesses or implantation of peritoneal catheters, the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes and the transformation of nephrology outpatient clinics. This work details the adaptation and transformation of nephrology services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. During this period, elective admissions to Nephrology Services, elective surgeries and biopsies were suspended, and the kidney transplant programme was scaled back by more than 75%. It is worth noting that outpatient nephrology consultations were carried out largely by telephone. In conclusion, the pandemic has clearly impacted clinical activity in Spanish Nephrology departments, reducing elective activity and kidney transplants, and modifying activity in outpatient clinics. A restructuring and implementation plan in Nephrology focused on telemedicine and/or virtual medicine would seem to be both necessary and very useful in the near future.","output":"Impacto de la pandemia COVID-19 en los Servicios de Nefrologa Espa?oles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measles and influenza are two major diseasesCcaused an epidemic in India.

These applications employ digital biomarker models that must be trained on high-quality data. Such datasets are classified as personal sensitive and, due to privacy and consent regulations, might only be available for a restricted duration. Accordingly, the extension and thus the life-cycle of digital biomarker classifiers is compromised. To address this problem, we present a Privacy Preserving Synthetic Data Generation pipeline. It follows the Generative Replay approach proposed in the Continual Learning literature: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to generate synthetic medical samples. To ensure that the identity of subjects from the GAN training set is not compromised, a privacy evaluation is performed on the synthetic samples. We test whether a sample can be related to a subject by training a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) with triplet-loss. A sample gets classified as anonymized when it is sufficiently distant to any of the subject clusters, or if k-anonymity with k=3 is given. Finally, only the anonymized synthetic data, which preserves the main characteristics of the original data, is stored for later model training. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated on the example of a Respiratory Sound Classifier, which enables the reporting of respiratory symptoms in the form of a diary. Such a diary is relevant for chronic or infectious pulmonary conditions such as Asthma, COPD, or COVID-19. The training of the WaveGAN with varying the number of iterations based on our dataset of respiratory sounds resulted in synthetic audios with changing psycho-acoustic appearance. From low to high iterations, the appearance changed from primitive robotic to a normal human style. Further, the identification of subjects based on respiratory sounds has proven to be possible by a threshold distance of the sound embeddings computed from the SNN. Accordingly, the method is applicable to evaluate the anonymity of the synthetic sounds. Finally, the original and anonymized synthetic audios were used to train two different Respiratory Sound Classifiers, with a resulting accuracy of 90% compared to 85%, respectively. We conclude: the proposed method enables class-incremental learning without the issue of catastrophic forgetting, at the cost of slight performance degradation.","output":"Privacy preserving synthetic respiratory sounds for class incremental learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity and reporting delays have hampered efforts to mitigate and control the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic globally.

Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data.

This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways atypical. The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/Objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life? administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life? is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life?). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life? was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life? has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life? for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","output":"Combating hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients with a natural oxygen carrier, HEMO(2)Life?

METHOD Thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, BNI and CIAHL were searched from 1985 to 2021 for studies published in English. Data extraction was informed by a framework created for assessing methodological quality by Polanin, Pigott, Espelage and Grotpeter (2019) and adapted by Draper et al. (2019). RESULTS Of 8429 papers identified, 17 were selected for review. Two themes containing 10 subthemes described the emotional and psychological factors impacting the experience of end-of-life care, namely: a tension between desire and ability to communicate end-of-life news, and a conflict of hiding versus revealing self across several practical and emotional contexts. CONCLUSION Medical training is only a small factor in how well a person copes with end-of-life care and may sometimes feed negative appraisals . Lack of support from senior colleagues, fear of criticism and a sense of perceived failure were linked to lower self-efficacy in end-of-life care. Beyond learning practical skills, physicians benefit from understanding the psychological factors impacting their experience and in building self-efficacy, and observing senior colleagues effectively process strong and difficult emotions. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Promoting personal reflection and sharing of the experiences encountered in end-of-life care, especially modelled from senior colleagues, may contribute to improvements in competence and reduce the impact of heroism, feelings of failure and avoidance in practice.","output":"Communication and decision making at end-of-life- physician emotional experiences: qualitative studies systematicreview."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), emerged at the end of 2019 and caused an infection named COVID\\\\19 (Guan, Ni et al. 2020).

METHODS: This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10).

The technological tracing efficacy was measured at 80%, and we estimated that at least 11.0% of the discovered close contacts could not have been identified by manual contact tracing. Our results also indicated that digital contact tracing can flag individuals with excessive contacts, which can help contain superspreading related outbreaks. The overall effectiveness of digital tracing depends strongly on app uptake, but significant impact can be achieved for moderate uptake numbers.

METHODS: Analyses included data from 581 students (mean age = 18.7  0.5 years; 58% female; 48% non-white) who had their height and weight assessed at the start of classes (T1) and end of 9 weeks. Participants completed online daily sleep diaries from which total sleep time (TST) and the sleep regularity index (SRI) were calculated. Among participants who completed a DLMO protocol (n = 161), circadian phase was quantified by DLMO and circadian alignment by DLMO-bedtime phase angle. Data were analyzed with linear regressions that controlled for sex and average TST. RESULTS: Average SRI was 74.1  8.7 (range: 25.7; 91.6).

Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7C39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9C27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability).

A recent analog is being developed as a candidate drug against several pathological conditions, including COVID-19. However, the reasons behind its higher potency and increased binding affinity to complement proteins are not fully clear. This computational study highlights the mechanistic properties of several compstatin analogs, thus complementing previous experimental studies. We perform molecular dynamics simulations involving six analogs alone in solution and two complexes with compstatin bound to complement component 3. These simulations reveal that all the analogs we consider, except the original compstatin, naturally adopt a pre-bound conformation in solution. Interestingly, this set of analogs adopting a pre-bound conformation includes analogs that were not known to benefit from this behavior.

The results of the research conveyed that the technical skills, the teachers' lack of experience as well as the social situation of the students have made E-learning a complex process. The analysis also revealed that Master students have negative attitudes towards e-learning, and they would prefer face-to-face interaction in the classroom and handouts more than virtual learning.","output":"EFL Students Affective Attitudes towards Distance E-Learning Based on Moodle Platform during the COVID-19 the Pandemic: Perspectives from Dr. MoulayTahar University of Saida, Algeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is currently spreading in many countries. This paper proposes a simple approximate mathematical model for public health practitioners to predict the number of SARS cases and deaths. METHODS The model is based on four parameters: R(o) (basic reproductive number), F (case-fatality rate), i (incubation period), and d (duration of disease). The calculations can be done by hand or by using a computer spreadsheet. RESULTS The best parameters to fit Canadian data as of 6 April 2003 (before infection controls took effect) are R(o) = 1.5, F = 30%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. On 6 April (day 40) there were 74 cases and 7 deaths. If this trend continues, SARS numbers in Canada are predicted to be as follows: 387 cases and 34 deaths by 26 April (day 60), 4432 cases and 394 deaths by 26 May (day 90), and 50 500 cases and 4489 deaths by 25 June (day 120). By comparison, the best parameters to fit Hong Kong data as of 10 April 2003 are R(o) = 2.0, F = 20%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. CONCLUSIONS Using the proposed mathematical model, it was estimated that about 1.5 to 2 new infectious cases were produced per infectious case every five days. Also, about 20% to 30% of the cases die within 14 days. The case-fatality may therefore be considerably higher than initially thought. The model indicates that SARS can spread very fast when there are no interventions.","output":"A simple approximate mathematical model to predict the number of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases and deaths."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a debilitating overuse injury characterised by pain, impaired functional performance, morpho-mechanical changes to the Achilles tendon and triceps surae neuromuscular alterations.

Significant progress has been achieved with the use of biologic treatments, which specifically block pro-inflammatory molecules involved in the disease pathogenesis. The most commonly used biologics in JIA are monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins targeting interleukins 1 (IL-1) and 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-). Several biomarkers have been investigated in JIA. Aims: To assess the level of evidence available regarding the role of biomarkers in JIA related to guiding clinical and therapeutic decisions, providing disease prognostic information, facilitating disease activity monitoring and assessing biologic treatment response in JIA, as well as propose new strategies for biologic therapy-related biomarker use in JIA. Methods: We searched PubMed for relevant literature using predefined key words corresponding to several categories of biomarkers to assess their role in predicting and assessing biologic treatment response and clinical remission in JIA. Results: We reviewed serological, cellular, genetic, transcriptomic and imaging biomarkers, to identify candidates that are both well-established and widely used, as well as newly investigated in JIA on biologic therapy. We evaluated their role in management of JIA as well as identified the unmet needs for new biomarker discovery and better clinical applications. Conclusion: Although there are no ideal biomarkers in JIA, we identified serological biomarkers with potential clinical utility. We propose strategies of combining biomarkers of response to biologics in JIA, as well as routine implementation of clinically acceptable imaging biomarkers for improved disease assessment performance.","output":"Biomarkers of Response to Biologic Therapy in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and outbreak response represent a global crisis that has affected various aspects of peoples lives, including work. Speculation is rife about the impact of the crisis on employees. Countries and organizations worldwide have categorized some work as essential and, by extension, other work as nonessential. This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic by examining the relationship between work disruptions (at time 1) and general distress (at time 2) through various work stressors, contrasting the experiences of employees in essential versus nonessential work. For employees with essential jobs, there is a significant indirect effect of work disruptions on general distress through hindrance stressors. This relationship is not found for employees with nonessential jobs. The general distress of these employees is more strongly affected by disruptions through social stressors (here, social isolation). Hence, this study demonstrates how general distress is affected in different ways for employees conducting essential work and those conducting nonessential work. We further highlight the importance of considering social stressors in this relationship, especially for nonessential work. Organizational change communication quality mitigates the relationship between isolation and general distress for employees with nonessential jobs, but not for those with essential jobs.","output":"Disruptions and General Distress for Essential and Nonessential Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease with varying clinical presentations and outcomes, and responsible for a major pandemic that started in early 2020. With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 of ~1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.","output":"The rocaglate CR-31-B (-) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at non-cytotoxic, low nanomolar concentrations in vitro and ex vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Studies evaluating neutralizing antibody (NAb) after BNT162b2 vaccine are scarce.

Not only are contactless biometric identification options becoming more important, but face recognition has also recently been confronted with the frequent wearing of masks. These masks affect the performance of previous face recognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this paper, we propose a mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that utilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm that aims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of non-masked faces of the same identities. In addition to the distilled knowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by margin-based identity classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and non-masked faces. In a step-wise ablation study on two real masked face databases and five mainstream databases with synthetic masks, we prove the rationalization of our MaskInv approach. Our proposed solution outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) academic solutions in the recent MFRC-21 challenge in both scenarios, masked vs masked and masked vs non-masked, and also outperforms the previous solution on the MFR2 dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed model can still perform well on unmasked faces with only a minor loss in verification performance.

A link between anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and viral infections has long been suggested. APLs are assessed for anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) diagnosis, characterized by thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and coagulopathy. Furthermore, circulating immune complexes (CICs), arisen upon inflammatory responses and related immune dysregulation, can lead to endothelial cell damage and thrombotic complications. METHOD: We performed an extended panel including IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin, IgG/IgM anti-?2-glycoprotein-1, coupled with IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin, IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time), and a negative control group. IgG CIC analysis followed to evaluate inflammatory status, through a possible complement system activation. RESULTS: Our results showed low positive case percentage in IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin and IgG/IgM anti-?2-glycoprotein-1 assays (4.54%, 6.25%, and 4.55%; in early infection group, late infection group, and control group, respectively); few positive cases in IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V immunoassays; and no IgG CIC positivity in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data show a low aPL prevalence, likely excluding an involvement in the pathogenesis of CAC. Interestingly, IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and anti-annexin-V positive cases, detected in late infection group, suggest that aPLs could temporarily increase or could trigger a \\"COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome\\" in predisposed patients. Key Points a? To our knowledge, anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies, anti-annexin-V antibodies and CICs in COVID-19 patients have not been reported in the scientific literature. a? Lack of uniformity and the low percentage of aCL/a?2GP1 positivity preclude a putative role in CAC pathogenesis. a? IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V data show that distribution of positive case number increases in late infection patients, significantly in anti-annexin-V results, suggesting a possible role for these anti-phospholipid antibodies in disease course. a? aPLs can arise transiently in some patients with critical illness and SARS-CoV-2 infection (disappearing in a few weeks), as well as in other genetically predisposed patients; they could trigger a \\"COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome\\".","output":"Anti-phospholipids antibodies and immune complexes in COVID-19 patients: a putative role in disease course for anti-annexin-V antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 infected patients has been soaring in the Middle East countries. The disease poses a significant threat, decisions about prioritizing care should be made in accordance with the proven risk factors for complications. OBJECTIVE: The present study provides the first bespoke prediction model in the Middle East to identify COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for complications. METHOD: A case-control study design was adopted to compare the characteristics of successfully recovered patients with those who had complications. Complications were defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, sepsis or septic shock, pneumonia or respiratory failure, and death. The prediction model was created through multivariable logistic regression. C statistic was used to assess overall discriminatory ability. RESULTS: All COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients (n = 133) in Amman C Jordan were included in the study. Successfully recovered were 125 patients. The median age (IRQ) was 26 (10-40). Almost 30% were >40 years. Patients with complications were eight patients, age 63 (51.5-71.5). The prediction model identified the following variables as risk factors: diabetes (OR = 59.7; 95% CI: 3.5C1011.5, P = 0.005), fever (OR = 24.8; 95% CI: 1.4C447.3, P = 0.029), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (OR = 15.9; 95% CI: 1.3C189.7, P = 0.029), body mass index (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61C0.88, P = 0.001), abnormal Neutrophils (OR = 16.8; 95% CI: 1.0C292.0, P = 0.053). Prediction model was statistically significant, 2(5) = 86.1, p < 0.0005. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports from China, the most influential variables that led to disease progression in Jordanian patients were diabetes, fever, shortness of breath, body mass index, and abnormal neutrophils.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: 114 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in February 2020 were enrolled by a convenience sampling method. The Chinese version of the Mishel Illness Uncertainty Scale (MUIS) was used to assess patients' degree of illness uncertainty, and multiple regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors. RESULTS: The average total score of MUIS (Chinese version) was 52.22  12.51, indicating a moderate level of illness uncertainty. The dimension unpredictability turned out to have the highest mean score: 2.88  0.90. The multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that female (t = 2.462, p = .015), monthly family income not less than RMB 10,000 (t = -2.095, p = .039), and disease duration of 28 days or more (t = 2.249, p = .027) were independent influencing factors of illness uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 are at a moderate level of illness uncertainty. Medical staffs should pay more attention to female patients, patients with lower monthly family income, patients with the prolonged disease, and take targeted interventions to help them reduce illness uncertainty.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a urinary tract infection (UTI) pocket card on preferred antibiotic prescribing for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cystitis. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, pre-post study was conducted to compare outcomes following the introduction of a UTI pocket card. The primary outcome was prescribing rates for institutional first-line preferred antibiotics (cephalexin and nitrofurantoin) versus other antimicrobials for cystitis. Secondary outcomes included prescriber adherence to recommended therapy in regards to discharge dose, frequency, duration, and healthcare utilization rates. RESULTS: The study included 915 patients in total, 407 in the preintervention group and 508 in the postintervention group. The frequency of preferred antibiotic prescribing was significantly increased after the introduction of a UTI pocket card compared to prior to its introduction (81.7% vs 72.0%, P = 0.001). Significant increases in prescribing of an appropriate antibiotic dose (78.0% vs 66.8%, P < 0.0001) and frequency (64.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.0001) were also found post intervention. No significant differences were seen between the pre- and postintervention groups with regards to healthcare utilization rates.

However, the accompanying adverse events, the most common of which is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), substantially limit its wide application. Due to its unique physiological characteristics, CRS in CAR T-cell treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) may exhibit some special features. Although existing guidelines had greatly promoted the recognition and management of CRS, many recommendations are not fully applicable to B-NHL. Therefore, it is imperative to identify responses that are specific to CRS observed following CAR T treatment for B-NHL. Based on underlying biological processes and known pathophysiological mechanisms, we tentatively propose a new model to illustrate the occurrence and evolution of CAR T-cell-therapy-related CRS in B-NHL. In this model, tumour burden and bone marrow suppression are considered determinants of CRS. Novel phenomena after CAR T-cell infusion (such as local inflammatory response) are further identified.

Results highlighted negative impacts of distance education on both participant's psychology and learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. More specifically, results showed that first and second year students and those with lower computer skills reported the highest negative psychological effects (i.e., feeling anxious, bored and nerves). Further first-year students and those with lower computer skill levels reported a negative impact on learning (i.e., experiencing lethargy and laziness when taking online lectures, poor focus and inability of being self-reliant when learning) by distance education when compared with students in their third and fourth year or those with higher and average computer skills.

BFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation onto the core proteins of the melanoma-associated proteoglycan and the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain. In the presence of BFA, the melanoma proteoglycan core protein was retained in the ER but still acquired complex, sialylated, N-linked oligosaccharides, as measured by digestion with endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. The initiation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis was not affected by BFA, as shown by the incorporation of [6-3H]galactose into a protein-carbohydrate linkage region that was sensitive to beta-elimination. The ability of cells to use an exogenous acceptor, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, to elongate and sulfate core protein-free glycosaminoglycans, was completely inhibited by BFA. The effects of BFA were completely reversible in the absence of new protein synthesis. These experiments indicate that BFA effectively uncouples chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis by segregating initiation reactions from elongation and sulfation events.

AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed. SUMMARY: Advantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change.

We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the effects of various antiplatelet regimens on saphenous vein graft patency, mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding among CABG patients. METHODS We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Systems Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, American College of Physicians Journal Club and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were performed in duplicate. We conducted a random effect Bayesian network meta-analysis including both direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS We included 43 randomized controlled trials studying 15 511 patients. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor [odds ratio (OR) 2.53, 95% credible interval (CrI) 1.35-4.72; I2 = 55; low certainty] or clopidogrel (OR 1.56, 95% CrI 1.02-2.39; I2 = 55; very low certainty) improved saphenous vein graft patency when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CrI 0.30-0.87; I2 = 14; high certainty) and lower major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.63, 95% CrI 0.44-0.91; I2 = 0; high certainty) when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. Based on moderate certainty evidence, DAPT was associated with an increase in major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that DAPT improves saphenous vein graft patency, mortality and major adverse cardiovascular event. As such, surgeons and physicians should consider re-initiating DAPT for acute coronary syndrome patients after their CABG, at the expense of an increased risk for major bleeding.

Global certification schemes, like FSC and PEFC, based on some preventive provisions in their procedural frame, developed new approaches and derogations to maintain quality evaluation and the power of standards. Arising from COVID-19 restrictions, postponed audits (and the extension of the validity of existing certifications) or remote auditing became increasingly common. Based on a survey applied to companies that had CoC FSC audits in 2020, this study aimed at evaluating the perceptions of companies regarding the audits performed under COVID pandemic procedural derogations, along with other research objectives like the continuous investigation of certification drivers or advantages. Companies indicated that the certification bodies explained the characteristics of pandemic-adapted audits and conducted risk assessments before choosing the adapted approach. Almost half of the companies perceived significant differences between the on-site previous audits and the audits performed during the pandemic due to the imposed restrictions and adapted approaches. Additionally, companies found that hybrid or remote audits are not so efficient, and for the future on-site audits are preferred. The study concluded that making the auditing procedures less interactional is not yet a sufficiently mature approach;there is a clear need for better procedures, building online tools usage capacity, to better communicate the specificity of such procedures better, and to better balance the online evaluations with on-site assessments.","output":"Challenges for FSC Forest Certification: Audits in the Context of Pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We recently reported the development of the first African green monkey (AGM) model for COVID-19 based on a combined liquid intranasal (i.n.) and intratracheal (i.t.) exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we followed up on this work by assessing an i.n. particle only route of exposure using the LMA mucosal atomization device (MAD). Six AGMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2; three animals were euthanized near the peak stage of virus replication (day 5) and three animals were euthanized during the early convalescence period (day 34). All six AGMs supported robust SARS-CoV-2 replication and developed respiratory disease. Evidence of coagulation dysfunction as noted by a transient increases in aPTT and circulating levels of fibrinogen was observed in all AGMs. The level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung pathology was not quite as pronounced as previously reported with AGMs exposed by the combined i.n. and i.t. routes; however, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal swabs of some animals as late as day 15 and rectal swabs as late as day 28 after virus challenge. Of particular importance to this study, all three AGMs that were followed until the early convalescence stage of COVID-19 showed substantial lung pathology at necropsy as evidenced by multifocal chronic interstitial pneumonia and increased collagen deposition in alveolar walls despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in any of the lungs of these animals.

DESIGN: National retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Emergency childhood primary and secondary care providers across Scotland; two national paediatric intensive care units (PICUs); statutory death records. PARTICIPANTS: 273 455 unscheduled primary care attendances; 462 437 emergency department attendances; 54 076 emergency hospital admissions; 413 PICU unplanned emergency admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; and 415 deaths during the lockdown study period and equivalent dates in previous years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of emergency care consultations, attendances and admissions; clinical severity scores on presentation to PICU; rates and causes of childhood death. For all data sets, rates during the lockdown period were compared with mean or aggregated rates for the equivalent dates in 2016C2019. RESULTS: The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell as a proportion of cases for the entire population, with an OR of 0.52 for likelihood of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0.37 to 0.73), compared with the equivalent period in previous years. Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years. Mortality during lockdown did not change significantly compared with 2016C2019.

Although the primary tumours are surgically removed, the effects of perioperative hyperoxia exposure on distal micro-metastases and on circulating cancer cells can potentially play a role in cancer progression or recurrence. In clinical trials, hyperoxia seems to increase the rate of postoperative complications and, by delaying postoperative recovery, it can alter the return to intended oncological treatment. The effects of supplemental oxygen on the long-term mortality of surgical cancer patients offer, at this point, conflicting results. In experimental studies, hyperoxia effects on cancer biology were explored following multiple pathways. In cancer cell cultures and animal models, hyperoxia increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases the oxidative stress. These can be followed by the induction of the expression of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other molecules involved in angiogenesis and by the promotion of various degrees of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).","output":"Exploring Hyperoxia Effects in CancerFrom Perioperative Clinical Data to Potential Molecular Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elimination of viral infections is dependent on rapid recruitment of leucocytes to infected areas. Chemokines constitute a class of cytokines that regulate migration of leucocytes to sites of infection. In this work, the expression and function of CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5 and their ligands during a generalized herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV\\\\2) infection in mice were studied. Many CCR1 and CCR5 ligands were expressed in infected organs after intraperitoneal infection. In particular, CC chemokine expression in the liver preceded the expression of CCR1 and CCR5, suggesting recruitment of cells bearing these receptors, which correlated with a decrease in viral titres. Administration of Met\\\\RANTES, a CCR1 and CCR5 antagonist, led to impaired antiviral response with significantly higher viral titre in the liver on days 1 and 6 after infection. This observation was accompanied by a decreased and shortened recruitment of natural killer cells to the peritoneum of infected mice treated with the antagonist. Despite this reduced recruitment of antiviral leucocytes in mice receiving Met\\\\RANTES, peritoneal cells from these mice produced markedly enhanced levels of pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, the results suggest that CCR1 and/or CCR5 are important for both viral clearance and eventual control of the immune response.","output":"Blocking CC Chemokine Receptor (CCR) 1 and CCR5 During Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Infection In Vivo Impairs Host Defence and Perturbs the Cytokine Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have demonstrated that ivermectin (IVM) exhibits antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the repurposing of IVM for treatment of COVID-19 has presented challenges primarily due to the low IVM plasma concentration after oral administration, which was well below IC(50). Here, a red blood cells (RBCs)-hitchhiking strategy was used for the targeted delivery of IVM-loaded nanoparticles to the lung. IVM-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (IVM-PNPs) and chitosan-coating IVM-PNPs (IVM-CSPNPs) were prepared and adsorbed onto RBCs. Both RBCs-hitchhiked IVM-PNPs and IVM-CSPNPs could significantly enhance IVM delivery to lungs, improve IVM accumulation in lung tissue, inhibit the inflammatory responses and finally significantly alleviate the progression of acute lung injury. Specifically, the redistribution and circulation effects were related to the properties of nanoparticles (NPs). RBCs-hitchhiked cationic IVM-CSPNPs showed longer circulation time, slower accumulation and elimination rates, and higher anti-inflammatory activity than RBCs-hitchhiked anionic IVM-PNPs. Therefore, RBC-hitchhiking provides an alternative strategy to improve IVM pharmacokinetics and bioavailability for repurposing of IVM to treat COVID-19. Furthermore, according to different redistribution effects of different NPs, RBCs-hitchhiked NPs may achieve various accumulation rates and circulation times for different requirements of drug delivery.","output":"Red blood cells-hitchhiking mediated pulmonary delivery of ivermectin: effects of nanoparticles properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mu opioid receptor (MOPr) agonists are well-known and frequently used clinical analgesics but are also rewarding due to their highly addictive and often abusive properties. This may lead to opioid use disorder (OUD) a disorder that effects millions of people worldwide. Therefore, novel compounds are urgently needed to treat OUD. As opioids are effective analgesics and OUD often occurs in conjunction with chronic pain, these novel compounds may be opioids, but they must have a low abuse liability. This could be mediated by diminishing or slowing blood-brain barrier transport, slowing target receptor binding kinetics, and showing a long half-life. NKTR-181 is a PEGylated oxycodol and a MOPr agonist that has slowed blood-brain barrier transport, a long half-life, and diminished likeability in clinical trials. In this study, we examined the signaling and behavioral profile of NKTR-181 in comparison with oxycodone to determine whether further therapeutic development of this compound may be warranted. For this preclinical study, we used a number of in vitro and in vivo assays. The signaling profile of NKTR-181 was determined by the electrophysiological assessment of MOPr-Ca(2+) channel inhibition in the nociceptive neurons of rodent dorsal root ganglia. Heterologous cell-based assays were used to assess biased agonism and receptor trafficking. Different rodent behavioral models were used to define the NKTR-181-induced relief of effective and reflexive nociception and drug-seeking behavior as assessed by an intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of NKTR-181. We found that NKTR-181 and oxycodone are partial agonists in G-protein signaling and Ca(2+) channel inhibition assays and promote limited MOPr desensitization. However, NKTR-181 inhibits Ca(2+) channels by a different mechanism than oxycodone and induces a different pattern of arrestin recruitment. In addition, NKTR-181 has a slower receptor on-rate and a slower rate of Ca(2+) channel coupling than oxycodone. This signaling profile is coupled with a slower onset of antinociception and limited drug-seeking behavior in comparison with oxycodone. Together with its known long half-life and slow blood-brain barrier transport, these data suggest that NKTR-181 could be further studied as a pharmacotherapeutic treatment modality for OUD.","output":"In vivo and in vitro Characterization of a Partial Mu Opioid Receptor Agonist, NKTR-181, Supports Future Therapeutic Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context.

The first pandemic is new, and to date, substantial resources have been allocated to urgently addressing its mitigation; the second has a long history with inconsistent attention and resources but has recently been spotlighted more intensely than at any time in the nations recent past. The authors contend that these 2 simultaneous pandemics have brought forth the need for institutions in the United States to make a renewed commitment to respect, wellness, diversity, and inclusion. While investment and leadership in these domains have always been essential, these have largely been viewed as a nice-to-have option. The events of much of 2020 (most notably) have illustrated that committing to and investing in policies, programs, centers, and leadership to drive change in these domains are essential and a need-to-have measure.

It is in the interests of health care systems to consider the wellness of the workforce to overcome the longer-term economic, systemic, and social trauma that will likely occur for years to come at both the individual and institutional levels. Maintaining or augmenting investment is necessary despite the economic challenges the nation faces.

Dietary compounds can be sensed by nuclear receptors (NRs) that consequently exert pleiotropic effects including immune modulation.

While LXR activation led to a decrease, LXR-deficiency resulted in an increase in MLN Th17 and RORt+ Tregs. Mechanistically, LXR signaling in CD11c+ myeloid cells was required to control RORt+ Treg. By contrast, modulation of MLN Th17 was independent of LXR signaling in either immune or epithelial cells. Of note, horizontal transfer of microbiota between LXR-/- and WT mice was sufficient to only partially increase MLN Th17 in WT mice. Despite LXR deficiency resulted in an increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae bacterial families compared to littermate controls, microbiota ablation (including SFB) was not sufficient to dampen LXR-mediated expansion of MLN Th17.

In this context, it has become mandatory to design age-selective measures aimed at achieving an optimal balance between protecting public health and maintaining a viable economic activity. METHODS: We programmed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed (SEIR) model in order to introduce epidemiologically relevant age classes into the outbreak-dynamics analysis. The model was fitted to the official death toll and calculated age distribution of deaths in Wuhan using a constrained linear least-squares algorithm. Subsequently, we used synthetic location-specific and age-structured contact matrices to quantify the effect of age-selective interventions both on mortality and on economic activity in Wuhan. For this purpose, we simulated four different scenarios ranging from an absence of measures to age-selective interventions with stronger physical-distancing measures for older individuals. RESULTS: An age-selective strategy could reduce the death toll by >30% compared with the non-selective measures applied during Wuhan's lockdown for the same workforce. Moreover, an alternative age-selective strategy could allow a 5-fold increase in the population working on site without a detrimental impact on the death toll compared with the Wuhan scenario. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age-selective-distancing measures focused on the older population could have achieved a better balance between COVID-19 mortality and economic activity during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.

Thirteen months since then, schools remain partially closed. Accumulated evidence suggests that children and adolescents are not the primary facilitators of transmission, limiting the restrictive effects of school closures on disease transmission.

Over the last decade, randomised trials employing online methods have gained momentum. Decentralised methods lend themselves to certain types of trials and can offer advantages over traditional trial methods, potentially increasing participant reach and diversity and decreasing research waste. However, decentralised trials that have all aspects of the trial exclusively online are not yet common, and those involving children even less so. This scoping review will describe and evaluate the methods used in these trials to understand how they may be effectively employed. Methods: Methods are informed by guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews. The search strategy was developed in consultation with an information specialist for the following databases: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase. Grey literature searches will be completed with the consultation of experts in decentralised trials and digital health using internet searches and suitable trial registries.

We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as \\"the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months\\" or \\"the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days\\". We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy;shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy;and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications.","output":"Control Strategies for COVID-19 Epidemic with Vaccination, Shield Immunity and Quarantine: A Metric Temporal Logic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rural communities are among the most vulnerable and resource-scarce populations in the United States. Rural data is rarely centralized, precluding comparability across regions, and no significant studies have studied this population at scale. The purpose of this study is to present findings from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to provide insight into future research and highlight the urgent need to address health disparities in rural populations. N3C Patient Distribution [Image: see text] This figure shows the geospatial distribution of the N3C COVID-19 positive population. N3C contains data from 55 data contributors from across the United States, 40 of whom include sufficient location information to map by ZIP Code centroid spatially. Of those sites, we selected 27 whose data met our minimum robustness qualifications for inclusion in our study. This bubble map is to scale with larger bubbles representing more patients. A. shows all N3C patients. B. shows only urban N3C distribution. C. shows the urban-adjacent rural patient distribution. D. shows the nonurban-adjacent rural patient distribution, representing the most isolated patients in N3C. METHODS: This retrospective cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 hospital systems presenting with COVID-19 between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were admitted (see Data Analysis Plan diagram for inclusion/exclusion criteria), analyzes outcomes and 30-day survival for the hospitalized population by the degree of rurality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between rurality, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality, controlling for major risk factors associated with rural-urban health discrepancies and differences in health system outcomes. The difference in distribution by rurality is described as well as supplemented by population-level statistics to confirm representativeness. Data Analysis Plan [Image: see text] This data analysis plan includes an overview of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the matrix for data robustness to determine potential sites to include, and our covariate selection, model building, and residual testing strategy. RESULTS: This study demonstrates a significant difference between hospital admissions and outcomes in urban versus urban-adjacent rural (UAR) and nonurban-adjacent rural (NAR) lines. Hospital admissions for UAR (OR 1.41, p< 0.001, 95% CI: 1.37 C 1.45) and NAR (OR 1.42, p< 0.001, 95% CI: 1.35 C 1.50) were significantly higher than their urban counterparts. Similar distributions were present for all-cause mortality for UAR (OR 1.39, p< 0.001, 95% CI: 1.30 C 1.49) and NAR (OR 1.38, p< 0.001, 95% CI: 1.22 C 1.55) compared to urban populations. These associations persisted despite adjustments for significant differences in BMI, Charlson Comorbidity index Score, gender, age, and the quarter of diagnosis for COVID-19. Baseline Characteristics Hospitalized COVID-19 Positive Population by Rurality Category, January 2020 C March 2021 [Image: see text] Survival Curves in Hospitalized Patients Over 30 Days from Day of Admission [Image: see text] This figure shows a survival plot of COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients in N3C by rural category (A), Charlson Comorbidity Index (B), Quarter of Diagnosis (C), and Age Group (D) from hospital admission through day 30. Events were censored at day 30 based on the incidence of death or transfer to hospice care. These four factors had the highest predictive power of the covariates evaluated in this study. Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Hospitalization and All-Cause Mortality by Rural Category, January 2020 C March 2021 [Image: see text] This figure shows the adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios for being hospitalized or dying after hospitalization for the COVID-19 positive population in N3C. Risk is similar between adjusted and unadjusted models, suggesting a real impact of rurality on all-cause mortality. A shows the unadjusted odds ratios for admission to the hospital after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis for all N3C patients. B shows the unadjusted odds ratios for all-cause mortality at any point after hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients. C shows the adjusted odds ratios for being admitted to the hospital after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis for all N3C patients. D shows the adjusted odds ratios for all-cause mortality for all-cause mortality at any point after hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients. Adjusted models include adjustments for gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) composite score, rurality, and quarter of diagnosis. The data provider is included as a random effect in all models. CONCLUSION: In N3C, we found that hospitalizations and all-cause mortality were greater among rural populations when compared to urban populations after adjustment for several factors, including age and co-morbidities. This study also identified key demographic and clinical disparities among rural patients that require further investigation. DISCLOSURES: Sally L.

Employees sometimes cannot go to the workplace due to epidemics such as COVID-19 that is spreading rapidly around the world, natural disasters and accidents. Companies can continue to serve their customers with the internet infrastructure and computer technologies they will provide to their employees. Thus, e-commerce companies can provide a sustainable competitive advantage in the sector. Working with the right suppliers is one of the important decisions that will improve the service quality of the firms and affect the sustainability of the enterprise. Methods: This study aims to select the best laptop for a company in the online trade industry using Entropy-based EDAS, CODAS and TOPSIS methods. In the study, 6 alternative laptops have been evaluated according to hard disk capacity, ram, battery power, processor speed, weight, price criteria. The Entropy method has been used to identify the weights of the criteria in the study. These criteria weights have been used in EDAS, CODAS and TOPSIS methods. TOPSIS, EDAS and CODAS methods have been used to determine the best alternative. Also, the correlation between the results of the TOPSIS, EDAS and CODAS methods has been examined with the Spearman Correlation approach. Results: As a result of the Entropy method, it has been determined that the most important criterion is the hard disk capacity criterion. TOPSIS, EDAS and CODAS method results have been compared and the most suitable alternative has been selected. According to the results of the study, the best alternative has been selected as A5. Spearman Correlation analysis results show that there was a strong positive relationship between the methods used and the results obtained. Conclusions: The study differs from existing studies in the literature in that it is the first study in which laptop selection was made using TOPSIS, EDAS and CODAS methods together. The results of this study can be compared with the results of future studies that will be carried out using different MCDM methods and different data.","output":"Equipment Selection for an E-commerce Company Using Entropy-based Topsis, Edas and Codas Methods during the Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy that was reported following meningococcus, polio, influenza and rabies vaccines. However, an association with the COVID-19 vaccine is yet to be established. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of an elderly gentleman with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or any recent viral or bacterial illnesses who presented with GBS 20 days after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination. The diagnosis was established based on physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electromyography (EMG). DISCUSSION: Due to the occurrence of GBS after certain types of infections, molecular mimicry has become widely acceptable as the underlying pathophysiology. The reported cases of GBS following vaccination further supported this theory, however proving a causal relationship between vaccines and GBS on the molecular level remains a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case in the state of Qatar. It is important to mention that more research is needed to establish an association between COVID-19 vaccine and GBS.

We have demonstrated the efficacy of FDA-approved axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) in a multiethnic New York City underserved population with 80% complete response (CR) rate in the first ten patients treated at our institution (Abbasi et al., 2020). There is limited data on the propensity of infections and lymphohematopoietic reconstitution after Day 30 (D30) following CAR-T cell therapy. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and nature of infectious complications in an expanded cohort of DLBCL patients treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy and its association with the dynamics of leukocyte subpopulation reconstitution post-CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who received CAR-T therapy at our institution between 2018-2020. Variables collected include patient demographics, absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte counts (AMC) at Day 30, hematologic reconstitution (ANC 1500/L) at Day 90 (D90), presence or absence of infections after D30 by clinical and/or microbiological parameters. Associations between presence of infection and D30 ANC, ALC, AMC, ANC/ALC ratio, AMC/ALC ratio were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Association between infection and hematologic reconstitution at D90 was done using Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Nineteen patients were evaluated in our study, consisting of 42% (8) Hispanic, 32% (6) Caucasian, 21% (4) African-American, and 5% (1) Asian subjects. Based on clinical and microbiologic data, 47% (9) developed an infection after D30 (infection group) while 53% (10) of subjects remained infection-free after D30 (non-infection group). The most common infection type observed was viral (11 patients) followed by bacterial (8 patients) and fungal (3 patients) (Table 1). Of 25 total infectious events, 44% (11) were grade 1 or 2 and 48% (12) were grade 3 with 10 being viral in etiology. Two deaths occurred due to an infectious process. Three patients tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Median OS and PFS has not been reached in either group. To determine the kinetics of lymphohematopoietic reconstitution and its association with infection risk, we evaluated the relationship between cytopenias and rates of infection after D30. Notably, compared to non-infection group, infection group had a higher median ALC (1000/L vs 600/L p=0.04), a lower median ANC/ALC ratio (1.4 vs 4.5 p<0.01) and a lower median AMC/ALC at D30 (0.36 vs 1.33, p=0.01) (Table 2). In addition, patients in the infection group had a lower rate of hematologic reconstitution (ANC >1500/L) at D90. We observed that only 22% (2) of patients had recovered ANC > 1500/Lin the infection group as opposed to 80% (8) in the non-infection group at D90 (p= 0.038). Rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) were comparable between the two groups (55.6% vs 70% p=0.52). Surprisingly, rates of immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was lower (55.6%) in the infection group compared to (90%) non-infection group (p=0.09). Fourteen of 19 patients had follow-up over one year, of which 8 (57%) remained in complete remission (CR). Conclusions: We demonstrate an infection rate of 47% (9) beyond D30 in patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T. Increased ALC, lower ANC/ALC and AMC/ALC ratios at D30 may be predictive of infectious complications. Median OS has not been reached in our cohort. Given the potential clinical impact, our observations should be corroborated using larger datasets.

Targeting of tissues by magnetic particles has tackled several limitations of traditional drug delivery methods for both cancer detection (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging) and therapy. Delivery of magnetic particles offers the key advantage of high efficiency in the local deposition of drugs in the target tissue with the least harmful effect on other healthy tissues. This review first overviews clinical aspects of lung morphology and pathogenesis as well as clinical features of lung cancer. It is followed by reviewing the advances in using magnetic particles for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers: (i) a combination of magnetic particle targeting with MRI imaging for diagnosis and screening of lung cancers, (ii) magnetic drug targeting (MDT) through either intravenous injection and pulmonary delivery for lung cancer therapy, and (iii) computational simulations that models new and effective approaches for magnetic particle drug delivery to the lung, all supporting improved lung cancer treatment. The review further discusses future opportunities to improve the clinical performance of MDT for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and highlights clinical therapy application of the MDT as a new horizon to cure with minimal side effects a wide variety of lung diseases and possibly other acute respiratory syndromes (COVID-19, MERS, and SARS).","output":"Magnetic particle targeting for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To develop a taxonomy of interventions and a programme theory explaining how interventions improve physical activity and function in people with long-term conditions managed in primary care. To co-design a prototype intervention informed by the programme theory. DESIGN: Realist synthesis combining evidence from a wide range of rich and relevant literature with stakeholder views. Resulting context, mechanism and outcome statements informed co-design and knowledge mobilisation workshops with stakeholders to develop a primary care service innovation. RESULTS: A taxonomy was produced, including 13 categories of physical activity interventions for people with long-term conditions. ABRIDGED REALIST PROGRAMME THEORY: Routinely addressing physical activity within consultations is dependent on a reinforcing practice culture, and targeted resources, with better coordination, will generate more opportunities to address low physical activity. The adaptation of physical activity promotion to individual needs and preferences of people with long-term conditions helps affect positive patient behaviour change. Training can improve knowledge, confidence and capability of practice staff to better promote physical activity. Engagement in any physical activity promotion programme will depend on the degree to which it makes sense to patients and professions, and is seen as trustworthy. CO-DESIGN: The programme theory informed the co-design of a prototype intervention to: improve physical literacy among practice staff; describe/develop the role of a physical activity advisor who can encourage the use of local opportunities to be more active; and provide materials to support behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS: Previous physical activity interventions in primary care have had limited effect. This may be because they have only partially addressed factors emerging in our programme theory. The co-designed prototype intervention aims to address all elements of this emergent theory, but needs further development and consideration alongside current schemes and contexts (including implications relevant to COVID-19), and testing in a future study.

To assess the prevalence of PNS in the Polish elderly population and analyze its socioeconomic correlates based on the data from the nationwide PolSenior2 project. Special emphasis was put on potentially modifiable factors among the identified PNS predictors. Nutritional status was assessed in 5698 community-dwelling older adults with the Mini Nutritional AssessmentCShort Form. We evaluated the effect of age, sex, level of education, marital status, place of residence, subjective loneliness, and self-reported poverty on the nutritional status of the studied subjects. PNS was found in 25.3% of studied subjects (27.7% women and 21.9% men; p < 0.001). Female sex, older age, unmarried status (in men), subjective loneliness, and self-reported poverty were independent correlates of PNS. The two last above-mentioned predictors were identified as potentially modifiable. Based on our results, we recommend preventive interventions (e.g., performing regular screening), particularly in unmarried (men), poorly educated individuals, self-reporting poverty, complaining of loneliness, and the oldest old.

COVID-19 vaccination of healthcare and other essential workers is underway in many countries while immunization of the general public is expected to begin in the next several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately permitted to return to normal activities. Methods. We use a delay differential equation model to calculate the effects of vaccinee \`\`immunity passports'' on the epidemic spreading trajectories. The model incorporates age-structuring to account for children who are ineligible for vaccination, and senior citizens who are especially vulnerable to the disease. We consider consensus strains of virus as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 and B1.351 in our analysis. Results. We find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, unrestricted vaccinee--vaccinee interactions do not derail the epidemic from a path towards elimination. Vaccinee--non-vaccinee interactions should however be treated with far more caution. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be the better part of a year before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or ceased. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent, restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until the elimination of the disease is achieved. In all cases, the death tolls can be reduced by vaccinating the vulnerable population first. Conclusions. Designing high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drives with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants of efficacy, if any, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive augmented with selective relaxations for vaccinees will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death tolls and socio-economic cost.","output":"COVID-19 Spreading dynamics in an age-structured population with selective relaxation of restrictions for vaccinated individuals : a mathematical modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of teleconsultation using a mobile camera-phone to evaluate the severity of digital soft-tissue injury and to triage the injury with regard to management recommendations. With a built-in 110,000-pixel digital camera, pictures of the injured digit(s) or radiograph were taken by surgical residents in the emergency room and transmitted to another camera-phone to be viewed by the remote consultant surgeon. A brief medical and trauma history of each patient was relayed also by mobile phone. The consultant surgeon then reviewed all of these patients in the emergency room shortly after the initial telemedicine referral. Separate triaging for each digital injury into three groups was recorded during remote teleconsultation and according to actual treatment by the attending surgeon as follows: group I, the injury could be managed with conservative treatment, such as secondary intention wound healing, or primary closure with or without bone shortening; group II, skin grafting or local flap coverage was required for management of the injury; and group III, microsurgery such as replantation or free flap coverage was necessary to deal with the injury. Later, triaging was also performed individually by three junior plastic residents according to image review and patient referral information. Teleconsultation through a mobile camera-phone was performed for 45 patients with injuries of 81 digits from January to May of 2003. Of these 81 digital injuries, there were 12 cases (15 percent) where disagreement of triaging occurred between the teleconsultation and the actual treatment by the attending surgeon. In image reviewing, there was 79 percent sensitivity and 71 percent specificity in remote diagnosis of the skin defect and 76 percent sensitivity and 75 percent specificity in remote identification of the bone exposure regarding the concordance of opinions of all three surgeons; there was significant discordance in triaging in 20 cases (25 percent), and the difference in triaging was partly attributed to the inability to show instances of tiny exposed digital bone or tendon in some cases under the low-resolution digital image and the situation of a bloody oozing wound. In some cases, the difficulty in evaluating the probability of primary closure of severely avulsed skin edges or the probability of executing replantation for finger amputation also contributed to different triaging outcomes. Two neglected diagnoses of transected digital nerves were found and influenced triaging, highlighting the importance of on-site physical examination during teleconsultation. The telemedicine system using a mobile camera-phone based on the global system for mobile communication is feasible and valuable for early diagnosis and triaging of digital soft-tissue injury in emergency cases, with on-line verbal communication and review of the transmitted captured image. This system has the advantages of ease of use, low cost, high portability, and mobility. With advances in hardware for digital imaging and transmission technology and the development of the third-generation advanced mobile phone system in the foreseeable future, this system has potential for future applications in telemedicine and telecare.","output":"Teleconsultation with the mobile camera-phone in digital soft-tissue injury: a feasibility study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The research aims to review and assess the situation of the old adults as well as formal and informal elderly care in Poland at the time of Covid-19.

Our primary objectives for this interim analysis were to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Quidel Sofia? Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay RIDT in a high-risk, nontraditional population, and to describe the virology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in LTCF residents. METHODS: Personnel at LCTFs identified cases of ARI, collected nasal specimens, and ran RIDTs from 10/21/2016 to 4/28/2017. The residual nasal swab and leftover lysis buffer were placed into a viral transport medium tube and sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for confirmatory influenza RT-PCR testing. In addition, all specimens were tested for other viruses using the Luminex NxTAG? Respiratory Pathogen Panel. Sensitivity and specificity of the Sofia RIDT were calculated using RT-PCR results as the reference standard. RESULTS: Specimens were collected from 228 residents (mean age = 71.3  22.4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to specimen collection was 1.4  1.6 days (range: 0-7 days). Respiratory viruses were identified in 134/228 cases (58.8%); influenza viruses (A: 7.5% and B: 14.5%) were the most commonly detected virus by PCR, followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13.2%), RSV (11.0%) and coronaviruses (10.1%). The sensitivities of Sofia RIDT for influenza A and influenza B were 77.8% (95% CI: 52.4C93.6%) and 80.0% (95% CI: 61.4C92.3%), respectively, with specificities of 98.4% (95.3C99.7%) and 97.1% (93.4C99.1%), respectively. Overall performance assessment for influenza A or B yielded a sensitivity of 79.2% (65.0C89.5%) and specificity of 96.1% (91.7C98.6%). The estimated likelihood of discovering one of the first two influenza cases at a LTCF using this RIDT is estimated to be 95.7%. CONCLUSION: Although a wide constellation of respiratory viruses cause ARIs within LTCF populations, influenza is very common. Early ARI recognition in residents, with testing shortly after symptom onset, likely contributed to high performance of the Sofia RIDT.

Current instructions specify that the collection swab should be transported within its collection media to the laboratory. Developing a process whereby this swab is removed before transport to the lab would allow for improved automation and decreased manual manipulation of samples. METHODS: A proof of principle approach was taken by eluting viral particles from flocked swabs into collection buffer with and without a mucus background. Paired swab-free and swab-containing samples were transported to the laboratory and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 28) or RNaseP (n = 6). SARS-CoV-2 amplification was performed using the Hologic Panther Fusion Aptima and RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all proof of principle samples with Ct values indicative of dilution.

However, little is known about the nature of the illness in children. The reopening of schools underlines the importance of understanding the epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 infections. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pediatric COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from healthcare organizations in the United States. The study outcomes (hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, critical care) were assessed using logistic regression. The subgroups of sex and race were compared after propensity score matching. Among 12,306 children with lab-confirmed COVID-19, 16.5% presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), 13.9% had gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), 8.1% had dermatological symptoms (rash), 4.8% had neurological (headache), and 18.8% had other non-specific symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia and disturbances of smell or taste). In the study cohort, the hospitalization frequency was 5.3%, with 17.6% needing critical care services and 4.1% requiring mechanical ventilation. Following propensity score matching, the risk of all outcomes was similar between males and females. Following propensity score matching, the risk of hospitalization was greater in non-Hispanic Black (RR 1.97 [95% CI 1.49C2.61]) and Hispanic children (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.03C1.78]) compared with non-Hispanic Whites.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: NMIBC patients in instillations with BCG (induction or maintenance) during 2019/2020 were included, establishing a COVID-19 group (with a diagnosis according to the national registry) and a control group (NO-COVID). The cumulative incidence (cases/total patients) and the case fatality rate (deaths/cases) were established, and compared with the national statistics for the same age group. T-test was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: 175 patients were included. Eleven patients presented CIS (11/175, 6.3%), 84/175 (48.0%) Ta and 68/175 (38.9%) T1. Average number of instillations = 13.25  7.4. One hundred sixty-seven patients (95.4%) had complete induction.

Further characterization and analysis of how concomitant COVID-19 infection impacts different patient populations is important for improving treatment strategies. Patients with burn injures often require ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, and extensive surgical intervention. Concomitant COVID-19 infection in this population presents a new challenge to clinical teams. The purpose of this project is to compare COVID-19 positive burn patients treated at a regional burn center with those that are not. METHODS: Following IRB approval, our institutions burn registry was queried from March 2020-June 2021. Data on demographics, injury circumstances, COVID-19 status, and outcomes were collected. Continuous variables were nonparametric and\\\\compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared with Fischers Exact test, where appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 622 patients admitted at our institution, 19 tested positive for COVID-19 during their hospitalization. Demographic and injury information is reported in Table 1. There were statistically significant differences between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups in regard to race and presence of inhalation injury (p=0.0002, p=0.0002). The TBSA burned was slightly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (9.1 vs 6.7%). COVID-19 positive patients spent more time ventilated (4832.5 vs.12.2  16.2 days, p=0.0035**) and had both longer ICU (42.7137.41 vs 11.115.4 days, p=0.0175*) and hospital (26.3232.14 vs 8.17711.95 days, p< 0.0001***) lengths of stay (LOS). No COVID-19 positive patients died while 5% of the COVID-19 negative patients did. All outcomes were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar TBSA injury burden and age breakdown, patients at our institution who tested positive for COVID-19 required more time on the ventilator and were hospitalized longer. People of color had a higher percentage of positive tests than their Caucasian counterparts. While mortality rates were higher in the COVID-19 negative cohort, morbidities associated with longer LOS must be considered.","output":"61 A Burn Centers Experience with COVID-19 Positive Burn Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]you may be interested to read a paper by Fuller and colleagues from Sheffield, who conducted an observational cohort study with the aim of estimating the risk of adverse outcome after mild head injury in patients taking DOACs to guide emergency department management Head home Children are no exception where head injuries are concerned, it is estimated that more than 700 000 of them in the UK attend hospital every year with a head injury and less than 1% of these need neurosurgical intervention Previous studies have shown that up to 46% of cardiac troponin (cTn) testing in the ED is deemed inappropriate and results in not just wasted costs but unnecessary procedures [ ]it can also cause alarm and anxiety without adding value","output":"Highlights from this issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant regional inequalities of income and wealth exist in every Western European country and in North America, but their extent varies from country to country.

Materials and methods This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA over a period of 27 days. The presence, extent, and severity of PTD were documented. Two observers scored the pattern and extent of lung parenchymal disease including potential fibrotic features, as well as lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Consensus was achieved via a third observer. Interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics. Students t-test, chi-squared, and MannCWhitney U-tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. Results During the study period, 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA imaging. Ninety-three studies were analysed, excluding indeterminate CTPA examinations. Overall incidence of PTD was 41/93 (44%) with 28/93 patients showing small vessel PTD (30%). D-dimer was elevated in 90/93 (96.8%) cases. A high Wells score did not differentiate between PTD and non-PTD groups (p=0.801). The interobserver agreement was fair (kappa=0.659) for parenchymal patterns and excellent (kappa=0.816) for severity. Thirty-four of the 93 cases (36.6%) had lymph node enlargement; 29/34 (85.3%) showed no additional source of infection. Sixteen of the 93 (17.2%) cases had potential fibrotic features. Conclusion There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA and lack of a risk stratification tool. The present data indicate a higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Many hospitals limited face-to-face appointments to only the pregnant woman and restricted the number of support people present during labour, birth, and postnatal visits to one person. How these restrictions were experienced by partners and support persons of childbearing women are unknown. AIM: To explore the experiences of partners and support persons of women receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A two-phased qualitative study including an online survey and interviews. Analysis was undertaken using content analysis. FINDINGS: Partners and support persons experienced a sense of 'missing out' from the pregnancy and maternity care experience because of changes in the provision of care during the pandemic. They reported feelings of isolation, psychological distress, and reduced bonding time with babies. Conflicting information and processes within and across maternity services contributed to feelings of uncertainty and a perceived reduction in the quality of care. Partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions on maternity wards, however they also perceived these to be of benefit to women. DISCUSSION: Many partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions in maternity services during the pandemic; strategies to ensure their active involvement in maternity care are needed.

Presenting symptomatology in the outpatient setting was poorly characterized, making it difficult for primary care physicians to predict which patients would require hospitalization. Purpose To characterize presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection and baseline patient characteristics and evaluate for correlation with disease severity, duration, and chronicity in the outpatient setting. Methods 107 adult, English speaking patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases at the three primary care practices of Stony Brook University Hospital were studied between March and December, 2020. Survey data was collected from patient telephone interviews and electronic medical record (EMR) abstraction. Potential risk factors assessed included participant demographics, medical comorbidities, and number and type of symptoms at illness onset. Outcome measures included symptom duration, hospitalizations, and persistence of symptoms at 12 weeks from study enrollment. Results Patient self-report survey elicited nearly twice as many symptoms described at illness onset vs. those recorded in the EMR (p<0.0001). Higher number of symptoms at illness onset was positively associated with symptom duration and chronicity. The presence of fever and hypoxia at the onset of illness were each positively associated with eventual hospitalization for COVID-19 disease. Conclusions Early in the setting of newly emerging infectious diseases, particularly those such as COVID-19 which involve multiple organ systems, patient self-report of symptoms using a complete review of systems, rather than EMR abstraction alone, may be key for accurate disease identification and characterization as well as prediction of eventual disease severity, duration and chronicity.","output":"Patient Self-Report Superior to Electronic Medical Record Abstraction for Identifying Positive COVID-19 Symptoms at Illness Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT IMPACT: This study will help to characterize the root causes of racial and ethnic disparities in viral respiratory outbreaks and determine the extent to which this is unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that preventative interventions can be designed for future pandemics and epidemics. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The causes of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes are multifactorial but include social inequity driven by structural racism. This study seeks to characterize the patterns of these disparities by linking patient-level EHR data with population-level sociodemographic measures. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This retrospective review of adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the UCHealth System will compare rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality across racial and ethnic groups. Race and ethnicity are determined by patient self-report in the EHR. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses will be used to assess the association of these outcomes with sociodemographic factors. Potential confounders that will be adjusted for include Charlson Co-morbidity Index, disease severity and likelihood of readmission.

Our anticipated results include further adjusted analyses and comparisons to the 2009 pandemic. We will compare COVID-19 prevalence and outcomes by race/ethnicity with other viral infection outbreaks, adjusting for confounders. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Initial hospitalizations for COVID-19 at our institution are notable for a high proportion of Hispanic patients and smaller proportion of non-Hispanic whites, in contrast to the prior year. Our study will demonstrate the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities are typical in viral respiratory outbreaks, which can guide future interventions.","output":"40339 Characterizing the impact of social and structural determinants of health on racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 8, 2019, China is experiencing an outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) The purpose of this study is to","output":"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 944 Cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection of Non-COVID-19 Exporting City, Zhejiang, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world continues to face uncertainty due to COVID-19, there is concern for adolescent wellbeing as they attempt to cope with changes to their education and social interactions. Considering the trade-offs between physical distancing and virtual education versus in-person instruction may be particularly pertinent to understanding adolescent loneliness and worries surrounding COVID-19 and their academics. Adolescents (N = 1,708;age M = 12.42, SD = 2.40;53.3% girls and 46.7% boys) from the United States self-reported their perceptions of social support, COVID-19 attitudes, and indicators of wellbeing (i.e., loneliness, COVID-19 stress, academic worry) in an online cross-sectional survey between November 30, 2020 to December 21, 2020. Higher levels of social support and attitudes of lower COVID-19 concern were associated with lower levels of loneliness, COVID-19 stress, and academic worries. Adolescents receiving greater virtual instruction were more worried about their academics compared to those receiving greater in-person instruction. A moderation effect between loneliness and instruction type revealed that the effect of social support was stronger for those receiving greater virtual instruction. Despite the quick and dramatic change to ones education, adolescents were relatively unaffected by the type of instruction they had recently received. Instead, perceived social support and their attitudes toward COVID-19 were more strongly related to their wellbeing.","output":"Factors contributing to adolescents COVID-19-related loneliness, distress, and worries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing and isolation of cases is an important component of our strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2.

Given that eating disorders typically begin early in life, it is necessary to investigate the processes employed by children, adolescents, and emerging adults when seeking services for troubling symptoms. This is a growing concern as the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the number of individuals engaging in disordered eating behaviours. This scoping review explores the current state of the literature for evidence on how youth with eating disorder symptoms seek help, with the aim of better understanding how to identify and treat more individuals earlier. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology, we searched seven databases for studies published from January 2000 to April 2021 that reported on help-seeking attitudes, behaviours, and healthcare utilization patterns for children and adolescents (< 18 years), emerging adults (18C25 years), and a mixture of these groups (< 25 years). Seven thousand, two hundred, and eighteen articles were identified for review. After duplicates were removed, three reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed full-text articles. Findings related to help-seeking activity were extracted from the 62 articles that were ultimately included in this scoping review. RESULTS: Study findings were summarized into help-seeking patterns (i.e., rates, types) as well as factors ranging from the individual level to society that influenced help-seeking behaviour. Many youth meeting eating disorder criteria were not seeking help. Notable barriers to help-seeking included poor mental health literacy, experiences with healthcare providers who failed to detect and lacked knowledge about eating disorders, minimal support from family and friends, and stigma surrounding eating disorders and help-seeking for mental health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this scoping review can be used to inform early intervention and health promotion program development. Future research should focus on the help-seeking attitudes and activities among underrepresented groups with eating disorders (e.g., men, ethnic and gender minorities), the perspectives of family and other supporters in the help-seeking process for youth, and retrospective accounts from adults with lived experience of an eating disorder. Plain English summary Addressing and interrupting eating disorder-related thoughts and behaviours as soon as possible, with the help of a mental health professional, leads to better outcomes for youth struggling with an eating disorder. However, little is known about what prompts youth to talk about their weight, body, or eating concerns with someonelike their parent, friend, teacher, guidance counsellor, or primary care practitioner. This review explores the available published research on help-seeking patterns and preferences among youth with eating disorder concerns. Our team followed a standardized process to find 62 relevant articles for this paper. Of note, many young people who reported eating disorder concerns were not seeking help for themselves. Feeling supported by family and their primary care provider, understanding the signs of an eating disorder, and not feeling shame for reaching out for help reportedly led youth to speak up about their concerns. The findings have clinical implications for learning effective ways to help youth feel safe to speak freely about their eating disorder-related concerns, which enhances the chances of intervening early and catching symptoms before they worsen.

Due to the widespread use of technology in our daily lives, it is possible to record the activities of individuals through their different digital traces. In the present study we utilise a large mobile phone communication dataset containing time stamps of calls and text messages to study the circadian rhythms of anonymous users in a European country. After removing the effect of the synchronization of East-West sun progression with the calling activity, we used two closely related approaches to heuristically compute the chronotypes of the individuals in the dataset, to identify them as morning persons or larks and evening persons or owls. Using the computed chronotypes we showed how the chronotype is largely dependent on age with younger cohorts being more likely to be owls than older cohorts. Moreover, our analysis showed how on average females have distinctly different chronotypes from males. Younger females are more larkish than males while older females are more owlish. Finally, we also studied the period of low calling activity for each of the users which is considered as a marker of their sleep period during the night. We found that while extreme larks tend to sleep more than extreme owls on the weekends, we do not observe much variation between them on weekdays.

DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study comparing the effects of ARB or ACE inhibitors versus no ARBs or ACE inhibitors in males versus females. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 downregulates ACE-2, potentially increasing angiotensin II (a pro-inflammatory vasoconstrictor). Sex-based differences in RAS dysregulation may explain sex-based differences in responses to ARBs because the ACE2 gene is on the X chromosome. We recorded baseline characteristics, comorbidities, prehospital ARBs or ACE inhibitor treatment, use of organ support and mortality, and measured RAS components at admission and days 2, 4, 7, and 14 in a subgroup (n = 46), recorded d-dimer (n = 967), comparing males with females. SETTING ARBs CORONA I is a multicenter Canadian observational cohort of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. This analysis includes patients admitted to 10 large urban hospitals across the four most populated provinces. PATIENTS One-thousand six-hundred eighty-six patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (February 2020 to March 2021) for acute COVID-19 illness were included. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Males on ARBs before admission had decreased use of ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.52; p = 0.007) and vasopressors (aOR = 0.55; p = 0.011) compared with males not on ARBs or ACE inhibitors. No significant effects were observed in females for these outcomes. The test for interaction was significant for use of ventilation (p = 0.006) and vasopressors (p = 0.044) indicating significantly different responses to ARBs according to sex. Males had significantly higher plasma ACE-1 at baseline and angiotensin II at day 7 and 14 than females. CONCLUSIONS ARBs use was associated with less ventilation and vasopressors in males but not females.

Although acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination will be a critical step in combating the pandemic, achieving high uptake will be difficult, and potentially made more difficult by social media misinformation. This study aimed to examine the association between social media use and acceptance of receiving COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 17 to June 19, 2021 among 504 participants of the general population in Saudi Arabia. The data were collected using a three-part online questionnaire (sociodemographic characteristics, medical and vaccination history, pattern of social media use). RESULTS: Among 504 participants who completed the survey, 477 participants were acceptant of the vaccine and 27 were non-accepting. A total of 335 individuals had already received the vaccine, 142 were willing to receive the vaccine and 27 were unwilling. One hundred and thirty participants denied using social media for COVID-19 news. Four factors were found to be significant in influencing vaccine acceptance in univariate analysis: having a chronic condition (odds ratio (OR) = 0.367, P = 0.019), believing that infertility is a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 0.298, P = 0.009), being concerned about a serious side effect from the vaccine (somewhat concerned: OR = 0.294, P = 0.022, very concerned: OR = 0.017, P < 0.0001), and basing the decision to be vaccinated on social media information (OR = 0.260, P = 0.006). Two of these factors fell away on multivariate analysis: basing the decision on social media information (OR = 0.356, P = 0.071), and a belief that vaccination causes infertility (OR = 0.0333, P = 0.054), suggesting that the associations are dependent on other factors.

Previous studies in healthy subjects showed that these vasopressors also affected the frontal lobe cerebral tissue oxygenation (rSO2) with a decrease after administration of phenylephrine. This decrease is unwarranted in patients with jeopardized cerebral perfusion, like CEA patients. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of both phenylephrine and ephedrine on the rSO2 during CEA. METHODS In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 29 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis underwent CEA under volatile general anesthesia in a tertiary referral medical center. Patients were preoperative allocated randomly (1:1) for receiving either phenylephrine (50 g; n = 14) or ephedrine (5 mg; n = 15) in case intraoperative hypotension occurred, defined as a decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP)  20% compared to (awake) baseline. Intraoperative MAP was measured by an intra-arterial cannula placed in the radial artery. After administration, the MAP, cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), stroke volume, and rSO2 both ipsilateral and contralateral were measured. The timeframe for data analysis was 120 s before, until 600 s after administration. RESULTS Both phenylephrine (70  9 to 101  22 mmHg; p < 0.001; mean  SD) and ephedrine (75  11 mmHg to 122  22 mmHg; p < 0.001) adequately restored MAP.

We sought to describe associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and surgical care and outcomes at 2 tertiary hospitals in Ethiopia. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study analyzing perioperative data collected electronically from Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (ACSH) in Mekelle, Ethiopia, and Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital (TGSH) in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. We categorized COVID-19 exposure as time periods: \\"phase 0\\" before the pandemic (November 1-December 31, 2019, at ACSH and August 1-September 30, 2019, at TGSH), \\"phase 1\\" starting when elective surgeries were canceled (April 1-August 3, 2020, at ACSH and March 28-April 12, 2020, at TGSH), and \\"phase 2\\" starting when elective surgeries resumed (August 4-August 31, 2020, at ACSH and April 13-August 31, 2020, at TGSH). Outcomes included 28-day perioperative mortality, case volume, and patient district of origin. Incidence rates of case volume and patient district of origin (outside district yes or no) were modeled with segmented Poisson regression and logistic regression, respectively. Association of the exposure with 28-day mortality was assessed using logistic regression models, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS Data from 3231 surgeries were captured. There was a decrease in case volume compared to phase 0, with adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.81) in phase 1 and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83-0.97) in phase 2. Compared to phase 0, there were more patients from an outside district during phase 1 lockdown at ACSH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.24-2.15]) and fewer patients from outside districts at TGSH (aOR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.21-0.87]). The observed 28-day mortality rates for phases 0, 1, and 2 were 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1-2.8), 3.7% (95% CI, 2.3-5.8), and 2.9% (95% CI, 2.1-3.9), respectively. A confounder-adjusted logistic regression model did not show a significant increase in 28-day perioperative mortality during phases 1 and 2 compared to phase 0, with aOR 1.36 (95% CI, 0.62-2.98) and 1.54 (95% CI, 0.80-2.95), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Analysis at 2 low-resource referral hospitals in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a reduction in surgical case volume during and after lockdown. At ACSH, more patients were from outside districts during lockdown where the opposite was true at TGSH. These findings suggest that during the pandemic patients may experience delays in seeking or obtaining surgical care. However, for patients who underwent surgery, prepandemic and postpandemic perioperative mortalities did not show significant difference.

We describe how regular reflective rounds were designed and implemented within an existing educational program at a UK children's hospital and report on the feedback received from participants. METHODS: Eight face-to-face reflective rounds took place in Southampton Children's Hospital, UK, from September 2017 to February 2020 with a further virtual round in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each round was facilitated by a clinical psychologist and consultant. For each round, up to three volunteer panellists from different staff groups were invited to share their personal experiences on a pre-selected subject to the large group. The group would then contribute to the discussion by offering their own reflections. Feedback forms were distributed to attendees and collated. RESULTS: Eight rounds were held with mean attendance of 32 (range 19-47). Across the eight rounds, the total attendance was 256 staff members. The virtual round had 20 participants. Feedback was received from 202 participants. The majority (98%) would recommend the rounds to colleagues with 64 participants (32%) rating the rounds as 'exceptional' and 91 (45%) as 'excellent'. The virtual round received similar positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Large group reflective practice can be implemented within an existing regular educational program.

The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has rapidly progressed to the form of a pandemic. The presentation is mild in about 80 percent of the cases, but the disease can also progress to a severe form of respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failure, especially in people with other co-morbidities.

Especially university life seems to hold several challenges impeding the manifestation of a health supporting manner, as many students tend to show a poorer health behavior and a higher amount of health-related problems than comparable age groups. This, along with a steady growth of the higher education sector, brings increased attention to the university setting in the context of prevention. To date, there are few empirical longitudinal and coherent cross-sectional data on the status of students health literacy, health status, and health behaviors, and on the impact of the study format on students health. The aim of this prospective cohort study is to reduce this research gap. METHODS: Starting during winter semester 2020/21, the prospective cohort study collects data on health literacy, health status and health behavior on a semester-by-semester basis. All enrolled students of the IST University of Applied Sciences, regardless of study format and discipline, can participate in the study at the beginning of their first semester. The data are collected digitally via a specifically programmed app. A total of 103 items assess the subjectively perceived health status, life and study satisfaction, sleep quality, perceived stress, physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug addiction and health literacy. Statistical analysis uses (1) multivariate methods to look at changes within the three health dimensions over time and (2) the association between the three health dimensions using multiple regression methods and correlations. DISCUSSION: This cohort study collects comprehensive health data from students on the course of study. It is assumed that gathered data will provide information on how the state of health develops over the study period. Also, different degrees of correlations of health behavior and health literacy will reveal different impacts on the state of students health. Furthermore, this study will contribute to empirically justified development of target group-specific interventions.

However, the current locomotion mode recognition systems being developed for intelligent high-level control and decision-making use mechanical, inertial, and/or neuromuscular data, which inherently have limited prediction horizons (i.e., analogous to walking blindfolded). Inspired by the human vision-locomotor control system, we designed and evaluated an advanced environment classification system that uses computer vision and deep learning to forward predict the oncoming walking environments prior to physical interaction, therein allowing for more accurate and robust locomotion mode transitions. In this study, we first reviewed the development of the ExoNet database C the largest and most diverse open-source dataset of wearable camera images of indoor and outdoor real-world walking environments, which were annotated using a hierarchical labelling architecture.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study where data was collected via a self-administered online questionnaire, from 264 pharmacists actively practicing in Kosovo during the pandemic. The questionnaire consisted of a combination of closed and open-ended questions, optional statements and statements on a five-point Likert scale, derived at least in part from the Transtheoretical Model. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in responses to Likert-type items whereas categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square testing. Main outcome measures Community pharmacists perceptions on COVID-19 related preventative measures. Results A response rate of 40.6% was achieved. Sufficient and adequate COVID-19-related preventative measures were being implemented by a majority of pharmacies (n = 232; 87.9%), and over two-thirds of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that their pharmacies were sufficiently prepared with protective equipment for their personnel. Implementation of preventative measures was associated with respondents perception that pharmacists and the pharmacy profession were valued more by patients during the pandemic and to a lesser degree, by other health professionals. Most commonly stated pros dealt with employee and patient safety, while key cons dealt with increased costs and running out of the necessary protective equipment. Key barriers to pharmacy activities were price increases by wholesalers, and patients panic and excessive buying, whereas drivers dealt with professional obligation to assist and opportunity to prove inseparable to other health professionals. The most popular means of accessing COVID-19 related information by pharmacists was via mobile devices and information from professional organizations was considered most useful by pharmacists.

Results: A total of 3.769 different GP centres participated, which included more than 10.000 GPs. Throughout the first three weeks, 20% declared they had insufficient resources for the following week. Approximately 10% continued to report this during the entire study. The majority reported being able to complete their daily tasks without loss of quality. During the first week, 30% indicated an increased workload. Afterwards, this number decreased and stabilized to an average of 10-20%. More than 70% of the consultations in March 2020 were conducted by telephone. This percentage declined in April and stabilized at approximately 30% in June 2020. Consultations due to respiratory symptoms peaked at 4000/100,000 at the beginning of the outbreak, then decreased over time along with the COVID-19 incidence. We noticed a lack of disinfectant hand gel, surgical masks and FFP2 masks, the latter remaining problematic in the long term. Conclusion: We introduced an instrument in Belgian EMR systems to monitor the burden on GPs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of PPE and increased workload were considered to be the main obstacles. A large number of the GP offices switched to teleconsultations to provide healthcare. Our monitoring instrument provided information for policy makers to intervene on a local level.","output":"Burden of COVID-19 on Primary Care: a Prospective Nationwide Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of safe and effective vaccines alone does not save lives, it is the inoculation plus other public health measures that do. Recent reports suggest the growing trend in vaccine preferential bias in parts of the world but not much data in Europe. The present paper aims to investigate the occurrence of COVID-19 vaccine preferential bias in Europe for effective vaccination planning and pandemic control. Method Data on vaccine-delivered for vaccination campaigns to the EU member states was collected from Eu center for disease control (EUCDC) on the COVID-19 vaccination radar. The data was processed for analysis on MS excel and both descriptive and statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 21. Analysis was performed at 95% CI and statistically, a significant difference was considered at p < 0.05. Results We observed statistically significantly lower vaccine uptake compared to the vaccine delivered doses in the present study (average at 62.678 +/- 3.928%) (p< 0.05, CI = 95%). Great variances in uptake for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines (50.927 +/- 4.626 %) compared to Pfizer-Biontech vaccine (86.285 +/- 2.1052 %) were observed compared to a previous prospective study on the wiliness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in the region (75%). Conclusion Public health practitioners and policymakers need to factor in the existence of COVID-19 preferential bias based on vaccine type or manufacturer. This will enable them to introduce policies including public education campaigns on the need to avoid bias on the wiliness to inoculate to enhance vaccine uptake for smooth and effective control of the pandemic.","output":"Overcoming COVID-19 vaccine preferential bias in Europe: Is the end of the pandemic still foreseeable?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the backdrop of ongoing Delta variant infection and vaccine-induced immunity, the emergence of the new Variant of Concern, the Omicron, has again fuelled the fears of COVID-19 around the world.

The findings of the study suggest that there exists a strong cross-sectional dependence between Covid-19 cases, deaths, and all the meteorological factors for the countries under study. The findings also reveal that a long-term relationship exists between all the meteorological factors. There exists a bi-directional causality running between the Covid-19 cases and all the meteorological factors. With Covid-19 death cases as the dependent variable, there exists bi-directional causality running between the Covid-19 death cases and Covid-19 confirmed cases, air pressure, humidity, and temperature. Temperature and air pressure exhibit a statistically significant and negative impact on the Covid-19 confirmed cases. Air pollutant PM2.5 also exhibits a significant but positive impact on the Covid-19 confirmed cases. Temperature indicates a statistically significant and negative impact on the Covid-19 death cases. At the same time, Covid-19 confirmed cases and air pollutant PM2.5 exhibit a statistically significant and positive impact on the Covid-19 death cases across the ten countries under study. Hence, it is possible to postulate that cool and dry weather conditions with lower temperatures may promote indoor activities and human gatherings (assembling), leading to virus transmission.

METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model for capecitabine and its three metabolites was built. Typical parameter values, characteristics of random distributions, associated with parameters, and covariates impact were estimated. Area under the curve (AUC) were computed for 5-FU and compared with grades of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic modeling was based on data collected on the first treatment cycle. Toxicity was assessed on the two first treatment cycles. RESULTS: The study was conducted in 43 patients. The population pharmacokinetic model (a one-compartment model per compound) was able to capture the very complex absorption process of capecitabine. Statistically significant covariates were cytidine deaminase, alkaline phosphatase and dihydrouracilemia (UH2)/uracilemia (U) ratio. UH2/U ratio was the most significant covariate on 5-FU elimination and CDA on the transformation of 5'-DFCR in 5'-DFUR. A trend was observed between 5-FU AUC and thrombopenia toxicity grades, but not with other toxicities. Best clinical response was not linked to systemic exposure of capecitabine metabolites. CONCLUSION: In our study, we propose a model able to describe, meanwhile, and its main metabolites, with a complex absorption process and inclusion of enzyme activity covariates such as CDA and UH2/U ratio.

Health care workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to this crisis as they are the first frontline to receive and manage COVID-19 patients. In this multicenter multinational survey, we aim to assess the level of awareness and preparedness of hospital staff regarding COVID-19 all over the world. Methods: From February to March 2020, the web-based or paper-based survey to gather information about the hospital staff's awareness and preparedness in the participants' countries will be carried out using a structured questionnaire based on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) checklist and delivered to participants by the local collaborators for each hospital. As of March 2020, we recruited 374 hospitals from 58 countries that could adhere to this protocol as approved by their Institutional Review Boards (IRB) or Ethics Committees (EC). Discussion: The awareness and preparedness of HCWs against COVID-19 are of utmost importance not only to protect themselves from infection, but also to control the virus transmission in healthcare facilities and to manage the disease, especially in the context of manpower lacking and hospital overload during the pandemic. The results of this survey can be used to inform hospitals about the awareness and preparedness of their health staff regarding COVID-19, so appropriate policies and practice guidelines can be implemented to improve their capabilities of facing this crisis and other future pandemic-prone diseases.","output":"Study Protocol for a Global Survey: Awareness and Preparedness of Hospital Staff Against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The phrase, \\"the federal spending power,\\" identifies the federal government's ability to spend in areas beyond its constitutional authority to legislate-a power that has supported the development of a national system of universal healthcare coverage in Canada.

The challenges exposed by the pandemic mean that still more federal investment will be required. Yet for traditionalists, the material basis of this power is now constrained: the federal government may possess the constitutional authority to invest, but it lacks the fiscal capacity; some form of belt tightening-even austerity-will be necessary.

Currently, vaccination represents the most effective prevention approach. HM pts have been shown to have lower immune responses to COVID19 vaccine, particularly those with lymphoid malignancies (LMs) (Herishanu, 2021; Thakkar 2021; Tzarfari 2021). We conducted an observational cohort study at Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to evaluate the immune response following one and two doses of the mRNA1273 (Moderna) vaccine in cancer pts. Here we report the results for pts with LMs and assessed associated factors. Methods: MCC pts who presented for the first mRNA-1273 vaccine dose from 1/12/2021-1/25/2021 and who provided consent were enrolled. Blood samples were collected prior to the 1 st and 2 nd doses (Days 1 and 29) and ~28 days after the 2 nd dose (Day 57). The IgG response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was measured using a two-step ELISA adapted from the Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) protocol. The total 103 LM pts who received both vaccine doses and had samples at all time points were included in analyses. The 214 pts with solid tumors (ST) were included as comparison. Associations of seroconversion (SV) rates with pt characteristics were evaluated using the Fisher exact test or Chi-square test as appropriate. Associations of antibody (Ab) titers with pt characteristics were examined using Kruskal Wallis test. Factors independently associated with SV rates were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R studio. Results: Baseline characteristics, cancer treatments and SV rates by these factors are listed in Tables 1 and 2. 55 pts had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), 23 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 15 had T- or NK-cell lymphoma (T/NK lymphoma) and 10 had Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). SV rates were significantly lower for LM pts compared to ST pts (49.5% vs 86.9% after the 1st dose and 68.9% vs 98.1% after the 2 nd dose, respectively, p<0.0001 for both doses). Pts with CLL and B-NHL had the lowest SV rates (21.7% and 43.6% after dose 1 and 65.2% and 58.2% after dose 2, respectively). None of the 11 pts on anti-CD20 monoclonal Ab (mAb) seroconverted after 2 doses. Pts on BTK inhibitors (BTKi) or PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) or venetoclax also had low SV rates [4/12 (33.3%) after 2 doses]. Only 1 out of the 8 pts post CAR-T seroconverted, despite the fact that 6 pts had CAR-T >12 months ago and 6 pts were in remission and have not received any cancer treatment after CAR-T. Pts with CLL and B-NHL but not on CD20 mAb/BTKi/PI3Ki/venetoclax or post CAR-T had much higher SV rates (31.3-60.5% after dose 1 and 79.0-81.3% after dose 2, Table 3). Other factors associated with lack of SV after 2 doses included: lymphocyte <1 x 10 9/L, low IgG level and on anticancer treatment within 3 months. Multivariate analyses showed that diagnosis of CLL or B-NHL compared to ST, CAR-T and CD20 mAb/BTKi/PI3Ki/venetoclax were independently associated with decreased SV after 2 doses (Table 4). In the univariate model, Ab titers after 1 and 2 doses were significantly lower in pts with diagnosis of CLL/B-NHL, low lymphocyte count, low IgG and on cancer treatment (Figures 1-3). HL and T/NK lymphoma had titers comparable to solid tumors (Figure 1). Conclusions: Pts with CLL and B-NHL had low SV rates and Ab titers after receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine when compared with ST, HL and T/NK-lymphoma. Current or past treatments with CD20 mAb/BTKi/PI3Ki/venetoclax and CAR-T were associated with lower immune response, with pooled SV rates of 16.7% after 2 doses. In general, LM pts had lower SV rates and Ab titers after the 1 st dose vs ST, but responses improved after the 2 nd dose. Further studies are needed to improve immune responses to COVID19 vaccines in LM pts, including the potential role of a 3 rd booster dose.

However, the workers perception of the stress and the changes that the pandemic has caused in their lives vary according to the conditions offered by these affected countries, including salaries, individual protection equipment, and psychological support. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of Brazilian health workers regarding the COVID-19 pandemic impact on their lives, including possible self-contamination and mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Brazil by applying a 32-item questionnaire, including multiple-choice questions by using the Google Forms electronic assessment. This study was designed to capture spontaneous perceptions from health professionals. All questions were mandatory and divided into 2 blocks with different proposals: personal profile and COVID-19 pandemic impact. RESULTS: We interviewed Brazilian health professionals from all 5 Brazilian regions (N=1376). Our study revealed that 1 in 5 (23%) complained about inadequate personal protective equipment, including face shields (234/1376, 17.0%), masks (206/1376, 14.9%), and laboratory coats (138/1376, 10.0%), whereas 1 in 4 health professionals did not have enough information to protect themselves from the coronavirus disease. These professionals had anxiety due to COVID-19 (604/1376, 43.9%), difficulties in sleep (593/1376, 43.1%), and concentrating on work (453/1376, 32.9%). Almost one-third experienced traumatic situations at work (385/1376, 28.0%), which may have led to negative feelings of fear of COVID-19 and sadness. Despite this situation, there was hope and empathy among their positive feelings. The survey also showed that 1 in 5 acquired COVID-19 with the most classic and minor symptoms, including headache (274/315, 87.0%), body pain (231/315, 73.3%), tiredness (228/315, 72.4%), and loss of taste and smell (208/315, 66.0%). Some of their negative feelings were higher than those of noninfected professionals (fear of COVID-19, 243/315, 77.1% vs 509/1061, 48.0%; impotence, 142/315, 45.1% vs 297/1061, 28.0%; and fault, 38/315, 12.1% vs 567/1061, 53.4%, respectively). Another worrying outcome was that 61.3% (193/315) reported acquiring an infection while working at a health facility and as expected, most of the respondents felt affected (344/1376, 25.0%) or very affected (619/1376, 45.0%) by the COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, the health professionals were exposed to a stressful situation and to the risk of self-contaminationconditions that can spell future psychological problems for these workers. Our survey findings showed that the psychological support for this group should be included in the future health planning of Brazil and of other hugely affected countries to assure a good mental health condition for the medical teams in the near future.","output":"Perceptions and Feelings of Brazilian Health Care Professionals Regarding the Effects of COVID-19: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is an infectious disease that has spread rapidly throughout the world.

ICU staff around the world have been subject to high levels of moral stress, potentially leading to mental health problems. There is only limited evidence on moral distress levels and coping styles among Spanish ICU staff, and how they influenced health professionals mental health during the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To assess moral distress, related mental health problems (anxiety and depression), and coping styles among ICU staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Design: Cross-sectional. Settings and participants: The study setting consisted of ICUs and areas converted into ICUs in public and private hospitals. A total of 434 permanent and temporary ICU staff (reassigned due to the pandemic from other departments to ICUs) answered an online questionnaire between March and June 2020. METHODS: Sociodemographic and job variables, moral distress, anxiety, depression, and coping mechanisms were anonymously evaluated through a self-reported questionnaire. Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted, and multivariate linear regression models were developed to explore the predictive ability of moral distress and coping on anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Moral distress during the pandemic is determined by situations related to the patient and family, the ICU unit, and resource management of the organisations themselves. ICU staff already reached moderate levels of moral distress, anxiety, and depression during the first wave of the pandemic. Temporary ICU staff (redeployed from other units) obtained higher scores in these variables (p = 0.04, p = 0.038, and p = 0.009, respectively) than permanent ICU staff, as well as in greater intention to leave their current position (p = 0.03). This intention was also stronger in health staff working in areas converted into ICUs (45.2%) than in normal ICUs (40.2%) (p = 0.02). Moral distress, coupled with primarily avoidance-oriented coping styles, explains 37% (AdR(2)) of the variance in anxiety and 38% (AdR(2)) of the variance in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that the emotional well-being of ICU staff was already at risk during the first wave of the pandemic. The moral distress they experienced was related to anxiety and depression issues, as well as the desire to leave the profession, and should be addressed, not only in permanent ICU staff, but also in temporary ICU staff, redeployed to these units as reinforcement workers.","output":"Moral distress, emotional impact and coping in intensive care units staff during the outbreack of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: China has witnessed a new virus Corona, which is named COVID-19 It has become the world's most concern as this virus has spread over the world at a higher speed;the world has witnessed more than one lakh cases and one thousand deaths in a span of few days","output":"A novel cellular automata classifier for COVID-19 prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to determine the levels of IgM and IgG antibody response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with different disease severity.

This scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA Guidelines Scoping Review Extension. CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, and The Cochrane Library were searched on 3 November 2018 to identify relevant quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies on pediatric nurse burnout. Our search identified 78 studies for inclusion in the analysis. Across the included studies, burnout was prevalent in pediatric nurses. A number of factors were identified as impacting burnout including nurse demographics, work environment, and work attitudes. Similarly, a number of outcomes of burnout were identified including nurse retention, nurse well-being, patient safety, and patient-family satisfaction. Unfortunately, there was little evidence of effective interventions to address pediatric nurse burnout. Given the prevalence and impact of burnout on a variety of important outcomes, it is imperative that nursing schools, nursing management, healthcare organizations, and nursing professional associations work to develop and test the interventions to address key attitudinal and environmental factors that are most relevant to pediatric nurses.","output":"What is known about paediatric nurse burnout: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Preventive medicine physicians work at the intersection of clinical medicine and public health. A previous report on the state of the preventive medicine workforce in 2000 revealed an ongoing decline in preventive medicine physicians and residents, but there have been few updates since. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe trends in both the number of board-certified preventive medicine physicians and those physicians who self-designate preventive medicine as a primary or secondary specialty and examine the age, gender distribution, and geographic distribution of this workforce. DESIGN Analysis of the supply of preventive medicine physicians using data derived from board certification files of the American Board of Preventive Medicine and self-designation data from the American Medical Association Masterfile. SETTING The 50 US states and District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS Board-certified and self-designated preventive medicine physicians in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number, demographics, and location of preventive medicine physicians in United States. RESULTS From 1999 to 2018, the total number of physicians board certified in preventive medicine increased from 6091 to 9270; the number of self-identified preventive medicine physicians has generally decreased since 2000, with a leveling off in the past 4 years matching the trend of preventive medicine physicians per 100 000 population; there is a recent increase in women in the specialty; the practice locations of preventive medicine physicians do not match the US population in rural or micropolitan areas; and the average age of preventive medicine physicians is increasing. CONCLUSIONS The number of preventive medicine physicians is not likely to match population needs in the United States in the near term and beyond. Assessing the preventive medicine physician workforce in the United States is complicated by difficulties in defining the specialty and because less than half of self-designated preventive medicine physicians hold a board certification in the specialty.","output":"The Supply and Distribution of the Preventive Medicine Physician Workforce."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic highlighted that workplaces may serve as a hub of disease transmission if proper precautions are not enacted.

Aims: The aim of the study was to document cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis seen at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology during COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) times. Methods: The study is a retrospective, institutional cohort, interventional study. It was carried out at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology from September 2020 to mid-March 2021. All patients of biopsy-proven mucormycosis were enrolled in the study. The patients were subjected to complete history taking, ophthalmological examination, and imaging studies. The patients were treated via a multidisciplinary approach with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of local necrotic tissue. Exenteration was done when indicated. A minimum 75-day follow-up period was accorded to all study patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. A P value &#8804;0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Thirty-one patients were seen, with a mean age of 56.3 years. The major risk factors included uncontrolled diabetes (96.7%) and COVID-19 positivity (61.2%), with concomitant steroid use in 61.2% patients. The most common presentation was diminution of vision (<6/60 in 80.64% patients) and ophthalmoplegia (77.4%). The most common imaging findings were orbital cellulitis (61.29%) and pansinusitis (77.4%). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was given to all patients for an average 18.93 days. Exenteration was required in (n = 4) 12.9% of cases. Twenty-eight patients recovered and were alive on follow-up. Mortality was seen in three patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of the Halyard H600 as a respirator filtering material as compared to the NIOSH-certified N95 and P100 filters, and determine if H600 is a good alternative for respiratory protection for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three filter types (Halyard H600, N95, and P100) were challenged with salt particles inside an exposure chamber at a flow rate of 43 LPM and relative humidity of 40  2%. N95 and P100 respirator filters were tested initially to establish the validity of the chamber, followed by the Halyard H600 fabric. Particle penetration was measured using an aerosol spectrometer. The filtration efficiency was calculated for different particle sizes by measuring the particle number concentration upstream and downstream of the filter. The pressure drop across the filter materials was measured using a manometer. RESULTS: The efficiency of the P100 for particles &#8805;250 nm was 100%. The N95 efficiency was 97  1% at 275 nm, 99  0% at 324 nm, and 100% for larger particles. The Halyard H600 fabric had a variable efficiency with an average of 62  28% at 275 nm, 89  8% at 324 nm, and 100% efficiency for particles >450 nm. The pressure drop values for P100 and N95 were 32 and 8 mmH2O, respectively. The Halyard H600 fabric resistance increased dramatically from 30 mmH2O at the start of the exposure to 65 mmH2O after 16-minutes of exposure. CONCLUSION: The high variability in filter efficiency for particles &#8804;324 nm and the increased fabric breathing resistance demonstrate that the Halyard H600 has an inferior performance and is not a good substitute for N95 and P100. Thus, the use of the Halyard H600 fabric for respiratory protection is not recommended.","output":"Filtration efficiency of surgical sterilization fabric for respiratory protection during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various measures have been taken in different countries to mitigate the Covid-19 epidemic. But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic (namely, 4 in this paper) and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level (i.e., the target transmission rate) for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million of infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billions ? instead of 6.88 millions of infected and a loss of 241 billions ?. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating measures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more appropriate.","output":"Analysis of the Tradeoff Between Health and Economic Impacts of the Covid-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis.

Because of its genetic barrier, DOR appears to be a good alternative in switch strategies compared to other NNRTI. Our aim was to evaluate the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) followed in our center who could be eligible to a DOR-based regimen. METHODS We collected data from all treatment-experienced PLWHIV, never exposed to DOR and with a demonstrated virological suppression. We analyzed previous genotypic analyses, clinical history, and previous exposure to NNRTIs. RESULTS We analyzed data from 653 patients, whose characteristics are shown in Table 1. 59% of them presented no resistance mutation (RAM) at genotypic analysis. The most common DOR-related RAM were V106A, Y181V, and Y188L. We also analyzed RAM that can possibly interfere with combination therapy (mostly K65R and M184V). In the end, 81.8% of our patients results to be eligible for a DOR-based therapy regimen. CONCLUSIONS DOR represents a good option for switch strategies in virological suppressed PLWHIV. It seems to have a higher genetic barrier and a lower risk for resistance mutation development compared to other NNRTI.

This study analyzed the COVID-19 pandemics effect on public hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in a large city in Brazil, Belo Horizonte, MG, with approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. METHODS: In a time-series analysis, this study used administrative data from the national Hospital Information System from 2010 to February 2020 to estimate the expected number of hospitalizations for CVD by month during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belo Horizonte in 2020 using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model. For CVD, this study compared the expected number of hospital admissions, intensive care use, deaths during hospitalization, and mean length of stay with the observed number during the period. RESULTS: There were 6,517 hospitalizations for CVD from March to December 2020, a decrease of 16.3% (95% CI: 4.7-25.3) compared to the projected. The number of intensive care hospitalizations for CVD fell 24.1% (95% CI 13-32.7). The number of deaths also decreased (17.4% [80% CI: 0 - 0.30]), along with the reduction in hospitalizations, as did the length of stay for CVD hospitalizations. These reductions, however, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for CVD were 16.3% lower than expected in a large Brazilian city, possibly due to the fear of getting infected or going to hospitals. Public campaigns informing how to proceed in case of CVD show that prompt urgent attention is essential to mitigate the indirect effects of the pandemic on CVD.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in a large Brazilian urban center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial Teacher Education (ITE) can be viewed as a formative space in professional teacher identity development. Practice plays a key role in shaping teacher identity, providing a window into the reality of school life, as well as nurturing professional autonomy. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, school life shifted suddenly and unrecognisably in March 2020. This paper focuses on the experiences of preservice teachers on an ITE programme (post-primary) in one Irish University during the period of sudden school closures. The data show the transition to be problematic, underscored by a chaotic pivot to virtual communication and a destabilising of the structures that normally provide consistency.

We explore Victor Turners work to consider school placement as an in between space for preservice teachers and to examine the extent to which sudden school closures heightened this sense of in betweenness. We argue that the pandemic and its lifting out of pervasive and predictable social structures, gave rise to a period of anti-structure.

It is suspected that selected mutations in the associated Fusion (F) protein may also be important in regulating fusion activity. To better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ISAV fusion, several mutated F proteins were generated from the Scottish Nevis and Norwegian SK779/06 HPR0. Co-transfection with constructs encoding HE and F were performed, fusion activity assessed by content mixing assay and the degree of proteolytic cleavage by western blot. Substitutions in Nevis F demonstrated that K276 was the most likely cleavage site in the protein. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions at three sites and two insertions, all slightly upstream of K276, increased fusion activity. Co-expression with HE harbouring a full-length HPR produced high fusion activities when trypsin and low pH were applied. In comparison, under normal culture conditions, groups containing a mutated HE with an HPR deletion were able to generate moderate fusion levels, while those with a full length HPR HE could not induce fusion. This suggested that HPR length may influence how the HE primes the F protein and promotes fusion activation by an ubiquitous host protease and/or facilitate subsequent post-cleavage refolding steps. Variations in fusion activity through accumulated mutations on surface glycoproteins have also been reported in other orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. This may in part contribute to the different virulence and tissue tropism reported for HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes.","output":"Dual Mutation Events in the Haemagglutinin-Esterase and Fusion Protein from an Infectious Salmon Anaemia Virus HPR0 Genotype Promote Viral Fusion and Activation by an Ubiquitous Host Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of the adaptive microenvironment components in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection is widely researched, but remains unclear Studying the common dynamics of adaptive immune response changes can help understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in critical patients The aim of the present study was to determine the cytokines concentration and leukocyte subpopulations profiles in the severe COVID-19 (n = 23) and critical (n = 18) COVID-19 group distinguished by the computed tomography (CT) severity score We observed lower percentage of lymphocyte subpopulation, higher neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and higher IL-6 concentration in critical COVID-19 group than in severe group CT severity score was negative correlated with proportion of lymphocytes, lymphocytes T, CD4+ cells, Treg cells and NK cells and positive correlated with neutrophils, NLR, and IL-6 In critical group more correlations between cytokines and lymphocytes were observed, mainly between TNF-, IL-1 and lymphocyte subpopulations The collective assessment of the cytokine profile, leukocyte subpopulations and the CT severity score can help to characterize and differentiate patient in advanced COVID-19 than the study of single parameters We have shown that the interconnection of elements of the adaptive microenvironment can play an important role in critical COVID-19 cases","output":"Cytokines and Leukocytes Subpopulations Profile in SARS-CoV-2 Patients Depending on the CT Score Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the outbreak of COVID-19, traditional face-to-face psychological intervention are difficult to achieve, so hotline becomes available and recommended strategies.

We find TIM-3-mediated and PD-1-mediated immunosuppression as a hallmark of severe COVID-19, particularly in men, with PD-1(+) cells being proximal rather than distal to TIM-3(+) cells. Concurrently, lymphocytes are distal, while activated myeloid cells are proximal, to SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, consistent with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection of myeloid cells in multiple organs. Finally, viral load positively correlates with specific immunosuppression and dendritic cell markers.

However, the use of these new technologies remains weak in the area of mental health and psychiatry. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the social representations associated with e-mental health by all actors to implement new technologies in the best possible way in the health system. METHODS: A free-association task method was used. The data were subjected to a lexicometric analysis to qualify and quantify words by analyzing their statistical distribution, using the ALCESTE method with the IRaMuTeQ software. RESULTS: In order of frequency, the terms most frequently used to describe e-mental health in the whole corpus are: \\"care\\" (n=21), \\"internet\\" (n=21), \\"computing\\" (n=15), \\"health\\" (n=14), \\"information\\" (n=13), \\"patient\\" (n=12), and \\"tool\\" (n=12). The corpus of text is divided into 2 themes, with technological and computing terms on one side and medical and public health terms on the other. The largest family is focused on \\"care,\\" \\"advances,\\" \\"research,\\" \\"life,\\" \\"quality,\\" and \\"well-being,\\" which was significantly associated with users. The nursing group used very medical terms such as \\"treatment,\\" \\"diagnosis,\\" \\"psychiatry\\",\\" and \\"patient\\" to define e-mental health.

This understanding of everyone's stakes will make it possible to redirect the development of tools to adapt them as much as possible to the needs and expectations of the actors of the mental health system.","output":"Social Representations of e-Mental Health Among the Actors of the Health Care System: Free-Association Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The coronavirus pandemic led to lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown caused various lifestyle changes that might have affected mental health. The study aimed to assess the effect of lockdown on stress level of Indian urban population. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire-based exploratory survey was conducted. A prevalidated Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) was used. A total of 120 questionnaires were sent via online social media using snowball sampling technique. PSQ Index scores were calculated for each participant. On the basis of these scores, participants were grouped into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. The ShapiroCWilk test was applied to check data for normality. Independent t-test was applied to find the difference of PSQ scores between males and females. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find the difference in PSQ scores between various occupational groups and between various age groups, followed by post hoc Tukeys honest significant difference (HSD) test. Results: Completely filled 100 responses were analyzed to form results. About 44% population was found to have moderate stress. Mean PSQ index was 0.35 for sample population with standard deviation of 0.17. Pearsons correlation between age and PSQ score was C0.452. Values of PSQ scores were higher for female participants, but the difference was not statistically significant. PQS scores were the highest in healthcare workers when compared with other occupations. Results of one-way ANOVA for various age groups were significant (F = 6.73, p = 0.001). Post hoc Tukeys analysis revealed that only group of senior citizens is significantly different from others. Results of one-way ANOVA for various occupational groups are significant (F = 3.79, p = 0.01), and the result of post hoc Tukeys HSD test suggests that only group of healthcare workers is significantly different from other groups. Conclusion: Results suggest prevalence of moderate stress level in studied sample population. More stress level was observed in females than males but the difference was not statistically significant. The stress level was higher among healthcare workers when compared with participants with other occupations. Stress was found to be negatively correlated with age of participants. The stress level was lowest in senior citizen participants when compared with other participants.","output":"Perceived stress during lockdown due to corona pandemic in Indian urban population: A questionnaire-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A well-validated in-silico approach can provide promising drug candidates for the treatment of the ongoing CoVID19 pandemic. In this study, we have screened 32 phytochemical constituents (PCCs) with Mpro binding site (PDB:6W63) based on which we identified three possible candidates that are likely to be effective against CoVID19-viz., licoleafol (binding energy: -8.1 kcal/mol), epicatechin gallate (-8.5 kcal/mol) and silibinin (-8.4 kcal/mol) that result in higher binding affinity than the known inhibitor, X77 (-7.7 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PCCs-Mpro complex confirmed molecular docking results with high structural and dynamical stability. The selected compounds were found to exhibit low mean squared displacements (licoleafol: 2.25  0.43 ?, epicatechin gallate: 1.93  0.35 ?, and silibinin: 1.39  0.19 ?) and overall low fluctuations of the binding complexes (root mean squared fluctuations below 2 ?). Visualization of the MD trajectories and structural analyses revealed that they remain confined to the initial binding region, with mean fluctuations lower than 3 ?. To access the collective motion of the atoms, we performed principal component analysis demonstrating that the first 10 principal components are the major contributors (approximate contribution of 80%) and are responsible for the overall PCCs motion. Considering that the three selected PCCs share the same flavan backbone and exhibit antiviral activity against hepatitis C, we opine that licoleafol, epi-catechin gallate, and silibinin can be promising anti-CoVID19 drug candidates.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, for Switzerland, due to the lack of synthesis studies, it is currently unknown how many people are affected by obesity at all. This knowledge may help to better estimate the relevance and size of this group at elevated risk, which could be incorporated into strategies to protect risk groups during the still unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide a first overall estimation of how many people in Switzerland are currently affected by grade 2 or 3 obesity. Methods: Five representative national population-based studies were accessed which were conducted between 2012 and 2017 and which include data on height and weight of adult men and women in Switzerland. Results: In Switzerland in 2012-2017, among the 11.20% adults who were obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt;=30.0kg/m2), 1.76% (95% CI 1.50-2.02) suffered from grade 2 obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2), and 0.58% (95% CI 0.50-0.66) from grade severe 3 obesity (BMI &gt;=40.0 kg/m2). Converted into estimated absolute population numbers, this corresponds to a total of approximately n=154,515 people who suffer from grade 2 or 3 obesity (n=116,216 and n=38,298, respectively). Conclusions: This risk group includes many younger people in Switzerland. The number of people with obesity-related risk becomes 3.8 to 13.6 times higher if grade 1 obesity and overweight people are also included in this risk group, for which there are arguments arising in the latest literature. In general, this large group at risk for severe COVID-19 should be given more attention and support.

The wellbeing of optometry students is an understudied topic. The wellbeing of optometry students studying in a blended undergraduate course during the COVID-19 pandemic was also unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the status of optometry students wellbeing during COVID-19, by identifying their experiences of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Moreover, to determine to what extent students experience these symptoms and what specific factors influenced their wellbeing. Methodology: Participants from four year groups completed online questionnaires. The response rate was 78.38% (n=87). Zung self-rating depression and anxiety scale questionnaires were used to determine whether students identified with a given list of symptoms commonly linked to anxiety or depression. Through open ended questions students wellbeing was further investigated. Results: Participants experienced normal levels of anxiety symptoms and most participants experienced mild to moderate depression symptoms. Of concern is the severe depression symptoms identified in the third and fourth year student cohorts. Mental health, Academics, Lifestyle, Relationships and Sleep were main themes identified that had an influence on the students general wellbeing. Uncertainty and Physical Health themes were additional influences of wellbeing specifically related to COVID-19. Contribution: This preliminary study into wellbeing of optometry students was undertaken in a unique timeframe, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provide a platform to determine baseline wellbeing in the future student cohorts and the exploratory identification of factors causing stress and anxiety. The impact of COVID-19 on the wellbeing of students is evident. Conclusion: Optometry students do experience symptoms of depression.

However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced perspective in which alpha oscillations also facilitate processes of cognitive control and perceptual stability. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over occipitoparietal cortex at 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) can selectively enhance EEG alpha power. To assess the contribution of alpha oscillations to attention, we delivered alpha-tACS across 4 experiments while 178 participants performed sustained attention tasks. Poor performance on all visual tasks was previously associated with increased EEG alpha power. We therefore predicted initially that alpha-tACS would consistently impair visual task performance. However, alpha-tACS was instead found to prevent deteriorations in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham- and 50 Hz-tACS. This finding was observed in 2 experiments, using different sustained attention tasks. In a separate experiment, we also found that alpha-tACS limited improvements on a visual task where learning was otherwise observed. Consequently, alpha-tACS appeared to exert a consistently stabilizing effect on visual attention. Such effects were not seen in an auditory control task, indicating specificity to the visual domain. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the view that alpha oscillations facilitate processes of top-down control and attentional stability.

METHODS: Descriptive and reflexive study by professionals and Nursing professors and academics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Professionals experience challenges when facing the pandemic considering the life conditions and misinformation of homeless people about COVID-19.Brazil's Unified Public Health System needs to take some measures to promote social distancing, access to toilets, mask and food distribution. Meetings with health teams and clinic on the street teams were held to organize care according to local reality, infrastructure, and users' flow. In a similar vein, intra and intersectoral articulations for joint actions on the street were articulated to provide access to health care and social assistance, and to accommodate and care for those presenting respiratory symptoms till improvement of the condition. Reorganizing actions is a dynamic process because each epidemiological stage demands new strategies as the pandemic advances or recedes. Attendance at Basic Health Care Centers was defined as priority:suspected COVID-19 cases and people with mental suffering or chronic disease.These people were identified to have face-to-face consultations or teleconsultations. In this sense, therapeutic interruption and worsening of conditions were avoided. Some management challenges are listed:information dynamics, the need to publicize, to qualify professionals and to articulate the network;care with the health team, keep away professionals from the group of risk and COVID-19 confirmed cases;training demands, input assurance, and agendas;electronic means to share information and to keep collegiate management.

This study used rapid sampling online microdialysis to evaluate the biochemical changes occurring in a segment of human bowel during and after resection, and assessed for the feasibility and reproducibility of this technique in monitoring intestinal ischemia. METHODS A custom made, rapid sampling online microdialysis analyzer was used to monitor the changes in the bowel wall of specimens being resected intraoperatively. Two patients were recruited for the pilot study to optimize the analyzer and seven patients undergoing colonic resections were recruited for the data collection and analysis. RESULTS The concentration of glucose in the extracellular bowel wall fluid decreased transiently after division of individual feeding arteries followed by a rebound increase in the concentration back to baseline concentrations. After completion of resection, glucose concentrations continued to decrease while lactate concentrations increased constantly. CONCLUSION Rapid sampling microdialysis was feasible in the clinical environment. These results suggest that tissue responds to ischemic insult by mobilizing glucose stores which later decrease again, whereas lactate concentrations constantly increased.","output":"Use of rapid sampling microdialysis for intraoperative monitoring of bowel ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To evaluate the strength of association between maternal and pregnancy characteristics and the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnancies with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Methods Secondary analysis of a multinational, cohort study on all consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 from 73 centers from 22 different countries. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite adverse fetal outcome, defined as the presence of either abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestations), stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 22 weeks of gestation), neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within the first 28 days of life), and perinatal death (either stillbirth or neonatal death). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate parameters independently associated with the primary outcome. Logistic regression was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30.69.5 weeks, with 8.0% of women being diagnosed in the first, 22.2% in the second and 69.8% in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were six miscarriage (2.3%), six intrauterine device (IUD) (2.3) and 5 (2.0%) neonatal deaths, with an overall rate of perinatal death of 4.2% (11/265), thus resulting into 17 cases experiencing and 226 not experiencing composite adverse fetal outcome. Neither stillbirths nor neonatal deaths had congenital anomalies found at antenatal or postnatal evaluation. Furthermore, none of the cases experiencing IUD had signs of impending demise at arterial or venous Doppler. Neonatal deaths were all considered as prematurity-related adverse events. Of the 250 live-born neonates, one (0.4%) was found positive at RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs performed after delivery. The mother was tested positive during the third trimester of pregnancy. The newborn was asymptomatic and had negative RT-PCR test after 14 days of life. At logistic regression analysis, gestational age at diagnosis (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.8-0.9 per week increase; p<0.001), birthweight (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.12.7 per 100 g decrease; p=0.012) and maternal ventilatory support, including either need for oxygen or CPAP (OR: 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.9; p=0.001) were independently associated with composite adverse fetal outcome. Conclusions Early gestational age at infection, maternal ventilatory supports and low birthweight are the main determinants of adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses with maternal COVID-19 infection.

A COVID-19 passport can play a key role in the control of the pandemic, specifically in areas with a high density of population, and the help of smart city technology could be very useful to successfully implement IPs. This research studies the impact of ethical judgments on user attitudes toward using vaccine passports based on a Multidimensional Ethics Scale (MES) that contains five ethical constructs: moral equity, relativism, egoism, utilitarianism, and contractualism. Regression analysis shows that MES satisfactorily explains attitude (R(2) = 87.82%, p < 0.001) and that a positive evaluation in moral equity, egoism and utilitarianism is significant (p < 0.001). The objective of the passport (variable leisure) shows a significant negative moderating effect on moral equity (coefficient = ?0.147, p = 0.0302) and a positive one on relativism (coefficient = 0.158, p = 0.0287). Adjustment by means of fsQCA shows that five ethical constructs satisfactorily explain both favorable and unfavorable attitudes toward IPs.

However, that influence is asymmetrical. To have a positive attitude toward the passport, it is a sufficient condition to attain a positive evaluation on a single ethical factor. On the other hand, when explaining resistance, and with the exception of the recipe ~utilitarianism (cons = 0.911 and cov = 0.859), explanatory prime implications require the interaction of at least two variables.

The mechanisms of immune response directed towards these tracheal allografts have not been fully determined. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of these grafts at the protein level, and functionally, in vitro and in vivo in a large animal model. Long-segment circumferential tracheal allografts were decellularized using two different protocols and recellularized using recipient mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and tracheal epithelial progenitor cells (TEC). Residual MHCI and MHCII immunostaining was found surrounding the submucosal glands despite cyclical decellularization. In an in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay, CD4+ T cells continued to proliferate on decellularized pieces and this proliferation was inhibited by co-culture with autologous MSC. Allografts were heterotopically transplanted under a muscle flap in the neck of the recipients and decellularization was found to delay leukocyte infiltration but resulted in eventual cartilage degradation. Recellularization prevented this infiltration up to 3 weeks post-transplantation and allowed for preservation of the cartilage. The immune cells found within these grafts included a significant number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-1, involved in proliferation, differentiation and function of regulatory T cells was found in these grafts. These results indicate that the immunological modification induced by recellularized tracheal scaffolds is an active process involving the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, rather than simply the removal of donor-derived antigenic components.","output":"The effect of decellularization of tracheal allografts on leukocyte infiltration and of recellularization on regulatory T cell recruitment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare the surgical outcomes between the transperitoneal (TP) and retroperitoneal (RP) approaches in robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for lateral tumors. METHODS This study included patients who underwent RAPN for lateral renal tumors between 2013 and 2019. Lateral tumors were defined as X of A factors in the RENAL nephrometry score. In total, 290 and 48 patients with TP and RP, respectively, were included in the analysis. To minimize the effects of selection bias, the following variables were adjusted using 1:1 propensity score matching: age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, tumor size, and RENAL nephrometry score. RESULTS After matching, 48 patients were allocated to each group. The mean age was 55 years, and the mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 68-69 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 30-31 mm. The RP group had a shorter operative time (124 vs. 151 min, p = 0.0002), shorter console time (74 vs. 110 min, p < 0.0001), shorter warm ischemic time (14 vs. 17 min, p = 0.0343), lower estimated blood loss (EBL) (33 vs. 52 ml, p = 0.0002), and shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS) (3.3 vs. 4.0 days, p < 0.0001) than the TP group. The change in eGFR, incidence rate of perioperative complication, and positive surgical margin rate did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION RP had better surgical outcomes, including shorter operative time, lower EBL, and shorter PLOS for lateral renal tumors, which may suggest that RP is the optimal approach for selected lateral renal tumors.","output":"Comparisons of surgical outcomes between transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches in robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for lateral renal tumors: a propensity score-matched comparative analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This guideline is an update of the 2011 European Guideline for the Management of Anogenital Warts.

The network diagram of Qingfei Paidu decoction was constructed using Gephi software. RESULTS: We identified 163 active ingredients, including MOL004798, MOL000519, MOL004824, MOL000554, MOL010428, and MOL013443, from 18 drugs in Qingfei Paidu decoction (such as Ephedrae Herba, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhiizoma, Farfarae Flos, Asteris Radix Et Rhizoma and Aurantii Fructus Immaturus). These ingredients activate renin-angiotensin system signaling pathway and apoptosis signaling pathway by regulating 10 protein targets (ACE, ACE2, AGTR1, FURIN, TNF, CASP3, CASP6, DPP4, MCL1 and POLD1) to execute 42 biological functions such as renin-angiotensin regulation of blood volume and systemic arterial blood pressure to treat COVID-19.

Cochlear implantation represents a well-documented treatment of profound HL that cannot be treated adequately with a conventional hearing aid, thus being offered to selected VS patients. A functional cochlea and cochlear nerve are prerequisites for sound perception with a cochlear implant (CI). The potential impact of radiotherapy on these structures is thus an important issue for subsequent CI hearing outcomes. The objective of this article is to present a case and to review the existing literature on the outcomes of cochlear implantation in irradiated VS patients systematically. METHODS A systematic literature review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was conducted. Medline was searched systematically. Papers reporting ipsilateral CI outcomes after radiotherapy of VS were included. Additionally, results of CI after stereotactic radiotherapy in a 54-year-old male with neurofibromatosis type 2 are presented. RESULTS A total of 14 papers (33 patients) fulfilled inclusion criteria. Moderate preoperative HL was found in 11 patients. Six had moderate to severe HL, whereas 16 had severe HL or total deafness. Postoperative hearing outcomes varied from poor in 27% of patients to excellent in 19%, with remaining cases lying in between (mean follow-up of 19 months). Most patients achieved improvement in hearing and quality of life. CONCLUSION Despite variation in the degree of hearing outcome, CI after radiotherapy of VS appears to be effective in the majority of cases, as more than 70% of patients have good or excellent outcomes within 1-2 years post-implantation.

Only five patients stated that COVID-19 contributed to their decision. The majority of patients (70.5%) expressed worries about an increased risk of infection with coronavirus-2 and worries that their IBD and/or IBD treatment might result in severe COVID-19. Women, patients taking immunomodulators and patients who considered their IBD to be severe were significantly more worried than the remaining population. Age, type of IBD, co-morbidity, level of education, work capacity and mental health were not associated with an increased level of COVID-19-specific worries. CONCLUSIONS In this selected IBD population, medical IBD treatment was rarely stopped or paused during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic even though 70% of the respondents expressed COVID-19-specific worries. These worries should, nevertheless, be addressed and the characteristics of the population who expressed concerns may be used in future targeted information to secure compliance. FUNDING none.

In fact, viruses interact with epigenetic factors to promote the viral replication by stimulating the entry into the lytic cycle, but also by promoting viral latency. Furthermore, epigenetics control the immune response implemented by the host to counteract viral infections. Thus, epigenetic modifications are identified as potential therapeutic targets to control viral infections. Several studies have already shown the efficiency of inhibitors of histone deacetylases, demethylases, acetyltransferases and methyltransferases, as well as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases in viral infections repression or in latency reactivation. In this review, we will examine the epigenetic regulation of viral infections by several DNA viruses, e.g. HSV, EBV, HCMV, KSHV, HBV, HPV and HAdV, and RNA viruses, e.g. HCV, HIV, IAV and CoV.

Disturbed amygdala-frontal network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity of the medial PFC and amygdala. The objective of this study was to determine whether modulation of dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms, improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to threatening stimuli. Methods: In this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5 consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms. SAD symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up. Results: Both 1 mA and 2mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the 2 mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was significantly larger than the 1 mA group. Only the 2 mA protocol reduced attention bias to threat-related stimuli, the avoidance symptom at follow-up, and depressive states, as compared to the sham group. Conclusions: Modulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks in SAD and thereby results in therapeutic effects. These effects can be larger with 2 mA vs 1 mA intensities, though a linear relationship between intensity and efficacy should not be concluded.","output":"Intensified stimulation targeting lateral and medial prefrontal cortices for the treatment of social anxiety disorder: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-comparison study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo: Este artigo considera a docncia na Educao Bsica, no contexto brasileiro, durante a pandemia da Covid-19 e suspens?o das aulas presenciais.

In Switzerland and many other countries, the shutdown to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections led to mobility restrictions and a decrease in therapy delivery. This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on stroke survivors access to therapy, physical activity, functioning and mood. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study in stroke subjects. At 4 time-points (before, during, after the shutdown, and at 3-month follow-up), the amount of therapy, physical activities, motor function, anxiety, and depression were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-six community-dwelling stroke subjects (median 70 years of age, 10 months post-stroke) were enrolled. Therapy reductions related to the shutdown were reported in 72% of subjects. This decrease was associated with significantly extended sedentary time and minimal deterioration in physical activity during the shutdown. Both parameters improved between reopening and 3-month follow-up. Depressive symptoms increased slightly during the observation period. Patients more frequently reported on self-directed training during shutdown. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 shutdown had measurable immediate, but no persistent, effects on post-stroke outcomes, except for depression.

Over 90% of participants had mild to serious levels of stress. Differences were found between participants with different stress perception states in terms of smoking history, active exercise, and sleep duration (p < 0.05). The participants who showed a preference for suspense movies more probably had lower stress [relative risk ratio (RRR)1 = 0.34, RRR2 = 0.26, p < 0.05], while students who showed preferences for crime film and disaster film more probably had higher stress (RRR = 2.03, p < 0.05, RRR = 3.15, p < 0.05). And the significant gender gap in different film genre preferences was observed in this study (p < 0.05). The males who showed preference for horror movies were more probably to have moderate stress (OR = 3.68, p < 0.05), and females who showed a preference for disaster movies were more probably to have high stress (OR = 3.27, p < 0.05).

Since the initiation of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many studies have reported a higher severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 among patients with cancer in general. AREAS COVERED: The immunomodulatory effects of ICI can modify the patients' immune system function in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There is controversy over whether the severity of COVID-19 in cancer patients who previously received ICI compared to other patients with cancer has increased. There is evidence that the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules in T cells, lymphopenia, and inflammatory cytokine secretion are associated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. EXPERT OPINION: ICI can interrupt the T cell exhaustion and depletion by interrupting the inhibitory signaling of checkpoint molecules in T cells, and augments the immune system response in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia. However, ICI may also increase the risk of cytokine release syndrome. ICI can be considered not only as a cancer immunotherapy but also as immunotherapy in COVID-19.

The standard neutralizing antibodies detection method is a live virus neutralization test.

There are conflicting research data on the sVNT methodology and the reliability of its results. We show that the performance of sVNT dramatically improves when the intact RBD from the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus variant is used as the plate coating reagent, and the HRP-conjugated soluble ACE2 is used as the detection reagent. This design omits the pre-incubation step in separate tubes or separate microplate and allows the simple quantification of the results using the linear regression, utilizing only 3C4 test sample dilutions. When this sVNT was performed for 73 convalescent plasma samples, its results showed a very strong correlation with VNT (Spearmans Rho 0.83). For the RBD, bearing three amino acid substitutions and corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant, the inhibitory strength was diminished for 18 out of 20 randomly chosen serum samples, and the magnitude of this decrease was not similar to the change in overall anti-RBD IgG level. The sVNT assay design with the ACE2-HRP is preferable over the assay with the RBD-HRP reagent and is suitable for mass screening of neutralizing antibodies titers.","output":"Fast and Accurate Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Based on Antibody-Mediated Blocking of the Interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University of Michigan-Dearborn offers a one semester, two credit, stand-alone Organic Chemistry Laboratory course aimed at students with an interest in health-related careers The COVID-19 pandemic led to a campus closure and a subsequent transition to a partially remote laboratory curriculum developed on-the-fly for the Winter 2020 semester followed by a full online course for our summer, accelerated sessions The online structure is a hybrid of readings, student made videos, instructor demonstrations, laboratory simulations, and structure elucidation assignments From our first iteration of the fully remote laboratory course, students are able to learn technique concepts and reaction background, interpret characterization data at similar levels to the face-to-face instruction setting However, since the experimental execution is visualized or simulated, it is more challenging to assess the skills gained","output":"Remote Organic Chemistry Laboratories at University of Michigan-Dearborn"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]the coronavirus outbreak places the female folk within a unique and precarious situation Yet, there are scant scholarly attentions, discussions and debates on how COVID-19 pandemic will provoke abusive behaviour and psychological trauma among Africans in its aftermath [ ]the essence of this edition is to shine light on these gaps in knowledge to obtain better information and evidence to resolving COVID-19 pandemic induced gender inequalities, violence against women, and irrational behaviour mostly in Africa An understanding of various coronavirus pandemic mitigation mechanisms by African political leaderships will help to shape informed policy and program responses to curb increases in violence and unruly behaviour as part of pandemic's eradication preparedness during and in the aftermath of COVID-19","output":"Editorial Note"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. METHODS: The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists. RESULTS: All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

We have identified a different human cellular glycoprotein that can serve as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV. A human lung cDNA library in vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped retrovirus was transduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the cells were sorted for binding of soluble SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins, S(590) and S(1180). Clones of transduced cells that bound SARS-CoV S glycoprotein were inoculated with SARS-CoV, and increases in subgenomic viral RNA from 1-16 h or more were detected by multiplex RT-PCR in four cloned cell lines. Sequencing of the human lung cDNA inserts showed that each of the cloned cell lines contained cDNA that encoded human CD209L, a C-type lectin (also called L-SIGN). When the cDNA encoding CD209L from clone 2.27 was cloned and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, the cells expressed human CD209L glycoprotein and became susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD209L is expressed in human lung in type II alveolar cells and endothelial cells, both potential targets for SARS-CoV. Several other enveloped viruses including Ebola and Sindbis also use CD209L as a portal of entry, and HIV and hepatitis C virus can bind to CD209L on cell membranes but do not use it to mediate virus entry.

Our aim was to develop a sensitive, rapid and accurate ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using pneumatically assisted electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) suitable for the determination of senicapoc in plasma samples. Unfortunately, direct analysis of senicapoc in crude acetonitrile extracts of human plasma samples by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS was subjected to significant and variable ion suppression from coeluting phospholipids (PLs). The interferences were mainly caused by the presence of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine classes of PLs, including their lyso-products. However, the PLs were easily removed from crude extracts by filtration through a sorbent with Lewis acid properties which decreased the total ion suppression effect to approximately 5%. Based on this technique, a simple high-throughput UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of senicapoc in 100-L plasma samples. The lower limit of quantification was 0.1 ng/mL. The mean true extraction recovery was close to 100%. The relative intra-laboratory reproducibility standard deviations of the measured concentrations were 8% and 4% at concentrations of 0.1 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL, respectively.

Decompensated liver disease patients from specialist alcohol and cirrhosis clinics were excluded. Patient satisfaction was scored from 1 C 10 (10 = extremely satisfied). We also performed a retrospective notes audit to review clinician rated effectiveness of the clinics looking at criteria such as appropriate triage, whether investigations/bloods were required to complete the review or if a physical exam was needed.ResultsThe survey was completed by 39 of 60 patients contacted (median age 54 yrs, range 23-85 yrs;M:F 19: 19 male, 4 had cirrhosis). 32 clinic visits were follow up and 7 were new. 90% of patients had access to internet and 100% had a phone. Viral hepatitis was the most common aetiology (42%), then NAFLD (13%) and AIH (10%). The median satisfaction score was 8 (4.5-10). Compared to F2F, 72% reported they had enough time, 85% felt the doctor listened, 85% got answers to questions, 90% had confidence in their doctor and 95% understood the management plan. 63% would prefer the option of VC post pandemic. There was no significant difference in ages between patients that preferred VC and those that didnt (mean 51y vs 55y;p=0.22). Travel distance and first language also did not appear to be associated with preference for VC. There was a significant difference (p=0.03) in unemployment between patients that preferred F2F (71%) compared to VC (29%). Most patients that preferred future VC still stated their ideal ratio would be 50:50. VC were rated as ineffective if requested bloods tests were not done within 4 weeks (42%, n=14) or a physical exam would have been required (n=2).ConclusionOur results indicate that the majority of patients with well compensated liver disease found virtual reviews acceptable but would still prefer an equal ratio of VC and F2F appointments in the future. Patient preference was not predicted by age, travel distance or first language, in contrast to employment status. Further studies are required to improve the clinical effectiveness of virtual reviews and patient satisfaction, including optimising triage criteria and improving access to investigations.2910 characters (max 3000 inc. spaces C includes title, authors and affiliations)","output":"Telemedicine outpatient hepatology clinics: A patient survey and notes audit during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic affected the whole world in 2020, with high pressure on the health sector, many deaths, reduced business activity, rising unemployment rates, travel restrictions and social distancing.

In many countries, primary and secondary pupils and university students alike were sent home as schools and universities closed abruptly as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus. As teaching moved online, learners and teachers were unprepared for the new situation, which posed a unique set of challenges. In this context, trainee teachers at a Swedish university were encouraged to support online teaching at schools in Japan, India and Kenya. The purpose of the digital internship was threefold: To continue the trainees teaching placements in the absence of opportunities for inclass teaching;to provide an opportunity for trainee teachers to develop their own competence in online teaching;and to assist the foreign schools in the challenging task of delivering online classes. This article aims to investigate the challenges faced by pupils in Japanese, Indian and Kenyan schools and by 27 Swedish trainee teachers during this project. Data collection consisted of interviews, an online questionnaire, lesson observations, assessment forms, and reports given by trainees. The main challenges identified through our findings included internet access in host countries, the use of a teacher-centred approach to learning, and difficulty for trainees to relate to the pupils life conditions. However, we conclude that the trainee teachers increased their global awareness through a climate-friendly alternative to the traditional teaching placement abroad. ? 2021, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

METHODS: We invited adults with epilepsy attending three centers in China from July 24 to August 31, 2021 to participate in this study. We also asked age\\\\ and sex\\\\matched controls among people attending for other chronic neuropsychiatric conditions and healthy controls accompanying people with illness attending the hospitals to participate. We excluded people who, under the national guidelines, had evident contradictions to vaccination. Participants were interviewed face\\\\to\\\\face using questionnaires. Vaccine uptake and postvaccine adverse events among the people with epilepsy were compared with those with neuropsychiatric conditions and controls. We also compared the willingness and reasons for hesitancy among unvaccinated participants. RESULTS: We enrolled 981 people, of whom 491 had epilepsy, 217 had other neuropsychiatric conditions, and 273 were controls. Forty\\\\two percent of those with epilepsy had had the first dose of a vaccine, compared with 93% of controls and 84% of the people with neuropsychiatric conditions (p < .0001). The majority (93.8%) of those immunized had inactivated vaccines. Among the unvaccinated people with epilepsy, 59.6% were willing to have the vaccine. Their main reasons for hesitation were potential adverse effects (53.3%) and concerns about losing seizure control (47.0%). The incidence of adverse events in the epilepsy group was similar to controls. Nineteen people with epilepsy reported an increase in seizure frequency. No episode of status epilepticus or prolonged seizures was reported. Two controls had their first\\\\ever seizure, which was unlikely related to the vaccine. SIGNIFICANCE: The vaccine uptake rate in people with epilepsy was lower than in their same\\\\age controls. The postvaccination effect was no higher than in controls. We found no evidence suggesting worsening seizures after vaccination. Measurement and education focused on increasing the vaccination rate in epilepsy are warranted.","output":"COVID\\\\19 vaccine take\\\\up rate and safety in adults with epilepsy: Data from a multicenter study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential detrimental effects of steroids on the immune system to fight viral infections had always been a concern for patients on long term steroids in chronic conditions.

Elective surgeries, including skin cancer excisions, were postponed. The purpose of this prospective case-control study was to assess the impact of the treatment delay on patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or melanoma operated in the first post-lockdown period. METHODS: A comparative study of skin cancer operations performed in a 4-month period either in 2020 or in 2019 was conducted. All data were collected from a prospectively maintained clinic database and the pathological reports. Continuous variables were compared with t test or Mann-Whitney U test according to their distribution. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher exact test. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to assess the risk of excising high-risk NMSC in 2020 compared with 2019. RESULTS: Skin cancer excision was performed in 158 cases in 2020 compared to 125 cases in 2019 (26.4% increase). Significantly, more SCC were excised in 2020 (p = 0.024). No significant difference for several clinical parameters regarding BCC, SCC, and melanoma was identified. However, the reconstructive method applied, following NMSC excision, was significantly different, requiring frequently either skin grafting or a flap. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that skin cancer treatment delay, due to COVID-19 pandemic, is related to an increased incidence of SCC and more complicated methods of reconstruction. Considering the relapsing COVID-19 waves, significant skin cancer treatment delays should be avoided.

Present all over the world, the virus spread rapidly from one person to another. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, exponentially spreading to the entire China. In the past months, COVID-19 becomes an outbreak throughout the world. The impact of this new virus brought horror to several countries as cities are quarantined and locked down and hospitals are overcrowded. A high infectious ailment that compromises the worldwide world, part of things isnt completely comprehended. Our study focuses on COVID-19-infected cases in India. Sickness classification is one of the significant and more time-consuming tasks in medical diagnosis system. In India, COVID-19 cases are slowly increasing day by day. Compared to advanced countries, the spread is under control. Here, we have customized our prepared dataset based on the government of Indias data provided by ICMR. Statistical analysis on COVID-19-infected, death and recovered cases among Indias various states is based on the real-time data. To forecast the coronaviruss epidemic peak, what might help us act appropriately to reduce the epidemic risk? We used compartmental model in epidemiology, the SEIR method, to forecast the number of confirmed cases based on the current scenario and population. Further, we used machine learning methods such as ARIMA and SEIR models to forecast Indias confirmed cases in the coming days and to start to forecast the decrease of infected cases by the end of the year 2020. Our study can predict the infected patients based on symptoms using ARIMA and SEIR model. At the last comparison of the cases based on prediction and with lockdown cases. Finally, we suggested preventive measures to minimize COVID-19 infections. This work expects to predict and forecast COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries through predictive modelling. The model helps to interpret public sentiment patterns on scattering related health information and assess the political and financial impact of the spread of the infection. Methods: Real-time data query has been visualized in this work. The queried data is used for susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) predictive modelling and forecasting the number of cases and infected using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). We utilized SEIR model and ARIMA model to forecast COVID-19 outbreak within India based on daily observations. Findings: At the time of writing this book chapter, the number of confirmed cases is expected to exceed 473,000 and reach the peak of this outbreak before 30 June 2020.

Here, we investigated 10 patients caused by co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and human adenovirus (HAdV), resulting in third-generation transmission. Materials and Methods: From Jan 15, 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with pneumonia in Hunan Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory investigation results from these patients were analyzed. An epidemiological investigation was performed to assess whether patient infections were linked using conventional methods and metagenomic sequencing. Results: The presence of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HAdV was determined via RT-PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and HAdV genomes clustered together, with similar genetic relationships. The first patient likely became co-infected during meetings or travel in Wuhan. The patient transmitted the virus via dinners and meetings, which resulted in four second-generation cases. Then, a second-generation case transmitted the virus to her family members or relatives via presymptomatic transmission. Conclusions: This study described an example of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HAdV in pneumonia patients, which caused third-generation cases and inter-regional transmission via meetings, household interactions, and dinner parties. We also observed the persistent and presymptomatic transmission of co-infection, which has the potential to make the continued control of the COVID-19 pandemic challenging.

However, few studies report on the relative perceptions of students about face-to-face (F2F) and blended learning (BL) in periods when Covid-19 is/not a consideration. Using a sample of 103/79 undergraduate students, a mixed-method approach is utilized to report qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding student perceptions. The results demonstrate BL is perceived more positively during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, F2F is preferred to BL when Covid is not an issue. F2F learning is perceived more positively to BL because students feel that there are limitations to BL in terms of; interactions with the lecturer; group work; peer engagement; class involvement; and the ability to ask questions about technical information. Moreover, qualitative evidence shows that students perceive F2F to be superior to BL because social elements expected in a F2F environment may not be embedded into netiquette frameworks. From a policymaking standpoint, we encourage embedding social elements into BL to enhance student experience so that student's negative attitudes regarding the transition from F2F delivery to online/BL can be minimized.

There are quite many guidelines on COVID-19, but only a few on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: We develop these recommendations to preserve adequate clinical practice for the management of HCC. METHODS: Experts of HCC in the AsiaCPacific region exchanged opinions via webinar, and these recommendations were formed. RESULTS: Close contact should be minimized to reduce possible exposure of both medical staff and patients to the novel coronavirus. To prevent transmission of the virus, meticulous hygiene measures are important. With the decrease in regular medical service, the medical staff may be mobilized to provide COVID-19-related patient care. However, diagnosis and treatment of HCC should not be delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic. The management of HCC should be the same as in non-pandemic circumstances. HCC is highly malignant, thus it is recommended not to delay curative treatment such as surgery and ablation. However, a kind of triage is necessary even among patients with HCC when resources are insufficient for all to be treated. Curative treatments should be periodized and cytoreductive or non-curative treatment such as vascular interventions and systemic therapy may be postponed until it can be performed safely with sufficient resources. For patients with confirmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, diagnosis and treatment should be postponed until the virus is eliminated or they are confirmed as not being infected with it.

Concerns limiting lung transplantation include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and the potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Importantly, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to those of transplant. Here, we report the results of lung transplantation in three patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. We performed single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in explanted lung tissue from the three patients and in additional control lung tissue samples. We conducted extracellular matrix imaging and single cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue from the three patients who underwent transplantation and on warm post-mortem lung biopsies from two patients who had died from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Lungs from these five patients with prolonged COVID-19 disease were free of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by smFISH, but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis that resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Using machine learning, we compared single cell RNA sequencing data from the lungs of patients with late stage COVID-19 to that from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and identified similarities in gene expression across cell lineages.

Peer education is a proven and effective approach for promoting reproductive health among young people, especially HIV/AIDS education. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a peer-led education intervention in addressing sexual and reproductive health related knowledge and concerns among young people in Kaduna and Kano States, northwest Nigeria. METHODS: A pre and post-test study was conducted among 8930 young people aged 15C24 years who participated in the MTV Shuga Peer Education intervention selected from communities in Kaduna and Kano States. A baseline pre-test was conducted before the education program, and it was followed up with a post-test at the end of the five-day long peer education sessions. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents, 7846 (87.9%) were adolescents aged 15C19 years while the rest 1084 (12.1%) were young adults aged 20C24 years. A total of 6099 (68.3%) of the respondents correctly stated that condoms prevent pregnancy during the pre-test compared to 6429 (72.0%) peers during the post test. Lower abdominal pain was correctly indicated as a symptom of STI by 6282 (70.3%) and 6984 (78.2%) of the respondents at pre-test and post-test respectively. More males (58.5%) had good knowledge about condom use compared to the females, 51.9% ((2) = 24.62, p < 0.001). while more females (79.6%) compared to 74.7% males opined that going for HIV test with their sexual partner is important to them during the pre-test ((2) = 19.44, p 0.001).However, no significant difference was observed on knowledge of condom use and opinion on going for HIV testing with sexual partner among either gender at post-test. CONCLUSION: Significant positive changes in knowledge, views and opinions regarding STIs and HIV, HIV anti-stigma and the use of condoms were observed following exposure to the peer sessions of the MTV Shuga peer education intervention.

Our findings indicate that economic considerations such as exposure to the pandemic and poor stock performance prior to the pandemic are the primary determinants of managements decision to share the pain of employees. Stakeholder concerns, proxied by higher employee-related corporate social responsibility scores, lower pay disparity between the CEO and the median employee, or a signatory to the Business Roundtable Statement, are not associated with managers sharing of the pain.

Although many computational and experimental phasing methods have been developed for analyzing diploid genomes, it remains challenging to reconstruct chromosome-scale haplotypes at low cost, which constrains the utility of this valuable genetic resource. Gamete cells, the natural packaging of haploid complements, are ideal materials for phasing entire chromosomes because the majority of the haplotypic allele combinations have been preserved. Therefore, compared to the current diploid-based phasing methods, using haploid genomic data of single gametes may substantially reduce the complexity in inferring the donor's chromosomal haplotypes. In this study, we developed the first easy-to-use R package, Hapi, for inferring chromosome-length haplotypes of individual diploid genomes with only a few gametes. Hapi outperformed other phasing methods when analyzing both simulated and real single gamete cell sequencing datasets. The results also suggested that chromosome-scale haplotypes may be inferred by using as few as three gametes, which has pushed the boundary to its possible limit. The single gamete cell sequencing technology allied with the cost-effective Hapi method will make large-scale haplotype-based genetic studies feasible and affordable, promoting the use of haplotype data in a wide range of research.","output":"Inference of Chromosome-Length Haplotypes Using Genomic Data of Three or a Few More Single Gametes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the ever-growing scale of Interactive Educational Systems (IESs) have led to the rise of data-driven approaches for knowledge tracing and learning path recommendation.

The study aimed to investigate the role of soluble (s)CD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels in predicting disease severity and characterize peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects). Methods: On admission, in COVID-19 subjects sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, and peripheral blood monocyte and DC subsets were compared to healthy donors (HDs). According to clinical outcome, COVID-19 subjects were divided into ARDS and non-ARDS groups. Results: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher sCD163 (p<0.0001) and sCD14 (p<0.0001) plasmatic levels. We observed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels in the ARDS group compared to the non-ARDS one (p=0.002). The cut-off for sCD163 plasmatic level greater than 2032 ng/ml was predictive of disease severity (AUC: 0.6786, p=0.0022; sensitivity 56.7% [CI: 44.1-68.4] specificity 73.8% [CI: 58.9-84.7]). Positive correlation between plasmatic levels of sCD163, LDH and IL-6 and between plasmatic levels of sCD14, D-dimer and ferritin were found. Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed lower percentages of non-classical (p=0.0012) and intermediate monocytes (p=0.0447), slanDCs (p<0.0001), myeloid DCs (mDCs, p<0.0001), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, p=0.0014). Compared to the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group showed lower percentages of non-classical monocytes (p=0.0006), mDCs (p=0.0346), and pDCs (p=0.0492). Conclusions: The increase in sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, observed on hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects, especially in those who developed ARDS, and the correlations of these monocyte/macrophage activation markers with typical inflammatory markers of COVID-19 pneumonia, underline their potential use to assess the risk of progression of the disease.

Previous generative approaches formulate protein design as a structure-conditioned sequence generation task, assuming the desired 3D structure is given a priori. In contrast, we propose to co-design the sequence and 3D structure of CDRs as graphs. Our model unravels a sequence autoregressively while iteratively refining its predicted global structure. The inferred structure in turn guides subsequent residue choices. For efficiency, we model the conditional dependence between residues inside and outside of a CDR in a coarse-grained manner.

Treatment efforts have been severely impeded due to the lack of specific effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-associated pathologies. In the present research endeavour the inhibitory prospects of cyanobacterial metabolites were assessed at the active binding pockets of the two vital SARS-CoV-2 proteases namely, main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) that proteolytically process viral polyproteins and facilitate viral replication, employing an in silico molecular interaction-based approach. It was evident from our analysis based on the binding energy scores that the metabolites cylindrospermopsin, deoxycylindrospermopsin, carrageenan, cryptophycin 52, eucapsitrione, tjipanazole, tolyporphin and apratoxin A exhibited promising inhibitory potential against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The compounds cryptophycin 1, cryptophycin 52 and deoxycylindrospermopsin were observed to display encouraging binding energy scores with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent estimation of physicochemical properties and potential toxicity of the metabolites followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of MM-PBSA energy scoring function established deoxycylindrospermopsin as the most promising inhibitory candidate against both SARS-CoV-2 proteases.

The recent pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2, is taking a heavy toll on society and planetary health, and illustrates the threat emerging coronaviruses can pose to the well-being of humans and other animals. Coronaviruses are constantly evolving, crossing host species barriers, and expanding their host range. In the last few decades, several novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans and domestic animals. Novel coronaviruses have also been discovered in captive wildlife or wild populations, raising conservation concerns. The evolution and emergence of novel viruses is enabled by frequent cross-species transmission. It is thus crucial to determine emerging coronaviruses' potential for infecting different host species, and to identify the circumstances under which cross-species transmission occurs in order to mitigate the rate of disease emergence. Here, I review (broadly across several mammalian host species) up-to-date knowledge of host range and circumstances concerning reported cross-species transmission events of emerging coronaviruses in humans and common domestic mammals. All of these coronaviruses had similar host ranges, were closely related (indicative of rapid diversification and spread), and their emergence was likely associated with high-host-density environments facilitating multi-species interactions (e.g., shelters, farms, and markets) and the health or well-being of animals as end- and/or intermediate spillover hosts. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms of the cross-species transmission events that have ultimately led to a surge of emerging coronaviruses in multiple species in a relatively short period of time in a world undergoing rapid environmental change.","output":"Cross-Species Transmission of Coronaviruses in Humans and Domestic Mammals, What Are the Ecological Mechanisms Driving Transmission, Spillover, and Disease Emergence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in clinical service delivery across hospital systems nationally. Local realities and resources were key driving factors impacting workflow changes, including for pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry service (PCLPS) providers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the early changes implemented by 22 PCLPSs from the United States and Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding similarities and differences in adaptations made to PCLPS care delivery can inform best practices and future models of care. METHODS: A 20-point survey relating to PCLPS changes during the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to professional listservs. Baseline hospital demographics, hospital and PCLPS workflow changes, and PCLPS experience were collected from March 20 to April 28, 2020, and from August 18 to September 10, 2020. Qualitative data were collected from responding sites. An exploratory thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data that were not dependent on predetermined coding themes. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Twenty-two academic hospitals in the United States and Canada responded to the survey, with an average of 303 beds/hospital. Most respondents (18/22) were children's hospitals. Despite differences in regional impact of COVID-19 and resource availability, there was significant overlap in respondent experiences. Restricted visitation to one caregiver, use of virtual rounding, ongoing trainee involvement, and an overall low number of COVID-positive pediatric patients were common. While there was variability in PCLPS care delivery occurring virtually versus in person, all respondents maintained some level of on-site presence. Technological limitations and pediatric provider preference led to increased on-site presence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study exploring pandemic-related PCLPS changes in North America. Findings of this study demonstrate that PCLPSs rapidly adapted to COVID-19 realities. Common themes emerged that may serve as a model for future practice. However, important gaps in understanding their effectiveness and acceptability need to be addressed.

RECENT FINDINGS: Bacterial infections and sepsis are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit and their management is further complicated by the increase in the global burden of antimicrobial resistance. In this setting, new diagnostic methods able to overcome the limits of traditional microbiology in terms of turn-around time and accuracy are highly warranted. We discuss the following broad themes: optimisation of existing culture-based methodologies, rapid antigen detection, nucleic acid detection (including multiplex PCR assays and microarrays), sepsis biomarkers, novel methods of pathogen detection (e.g. T2 magnetic resonance) and susceptibility testing (e.g. morphokinetic cellular analysis) and the application of direct metagenomics on clinical samples. The assessment of the host response through new omics technologies might also aid in early diagnosis of infections, as well as define non-infectious inflammatory states. SUMMARY: Despite being a promising field, there is still scarce evidence about the real-life impact of these assays on patient management. A common finding of available studies is that the performance of rapid diagnostic strategies highly depends on whether they are integrated within active antimicrobial stewardship programs. Assessing the impact of these emerging diagnostic methods through patient-centred clinical outcomes is a complex challenge for which large and well-designed studies are awaited.","output":"New Microbiological Techniques for the Diagnosis of Bacterial Infections and Sepsis in ICU Including Point of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expression of the exceptionally large RNA genomes of CoVs involves multiple regulatory mechanisms, including extensive proteolytic processing of the large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, by two types of cysteine proteases: the chymotrypsin-like main protease and papain-like accessory proteases (PLpros). Here, we characterized the proteolytic processing of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) amino-proximal pp1a/pp1ab region by two paralogous PLpro activities. Reverse-genetics data revealed that replacement of the PL2pro active-site cysteine was lethal. By contrast, the PL1pro activity proved to be dispensable for HCoV-229E virus replication, although reversion of the PL1pro active-site substitution to the wild-type sequence after several passages in cell culture indicated that there was selection pressure to restore the PL1pro activity. Further experiments showed that both PL1pro and PL2pro were able to cleave the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site, with PL2pro cleaving the site less efficiently. The PL1pro-negative mutant genotype could be stably maintained in cell culture when the nsp1-nsp2 site was replaced by a short autoproteolytic sequence, suggesting that the major driving force for the observed reversion of the PL1pro mutation was the requirement for efficient nsp1-nsp2 cleavage. The data suggest that the two HCoV-229E PLpro paralogs have overlapping substrate specificities but different functions in viral replication. Within the tightly controlled interplay of the two protease activities, PL2pro plays a universal and essential proteolytic role that appears to be assisted by the PL1pro paralog at specific sites.

Here we aimed to better understand the role of mast cells during the resolution phase of a local inflammation induced with the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 agonist zymosan. Multiple sequential immunohistology combined with a statistical neighborhood analysis showed that mast cells are located in a predominantly antiinflammatory microenvironment during resolution of inflammation and that mast cell-deficiency causes decreased efferocytosis in the resolution phase. Accordingly, FACS analysis showed decreased phagocytosis of zymosan and neutrophils by macrophages in mast cell-deficient mice. mRNA sequencing using zymosan-induced bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) revealed a strong type I interferon (IFN) response, which is known to enhance phagocytosis by macrophages. Both, zymosan and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced IFN- synthesis in BMMCs in similar amounts as in bone marrow derived macrophages. IFN- was expressed by mast cells in paws from na?ve mice and during zymosan-induced inflammation. As described for macrophages the release of type I IFNs from mast cells depended on TLR internalization and endosome acidification. In conclusion, mast cells are able to produce several mediators including IFN-, which are alone or in combination with each other able to regulate the phagocytotic activity of macrophages during resolution of inflammation.","output":"Bacterial and Fungal Toll-Like Receptor Activation Elicits Type I IFN Responses in Mast Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening respiratory failure, with increased inflammatory mediators and viral load.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan.

The purpose of this study was to examine if there have been measurable changes in domestic violence-related reports to child abuse and neglect hotlines. Using administrative child protection records from California, we plotted counts and proportions of child maltreatment reports with and without domestic violence allegations before and through the onset of school closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We used an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate whether or not there was a change in domestic violence allegations in child protection reports corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic. We document that during the first two quarters of 2020 there was a 14.3% drop in the overall number of child protection reports. Despite a decline in maltreatment reporting overall, there was a 25% increase in the proportion of reports with allegations of domestic violence.

Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94-95%, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time. Ethical considerations dictate that trial participants be unblinded and those randomized to placebo be offered study vaccine, leading to trial protocol amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on potential waning of VE over time and estimation of VE at any postvaccination time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual- and population-level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who are more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccine differentially over time.

Few studies on the genomic characteristics and prevalence of FeSCV have been conducted. To investigate whether FeSCV has been circulating in domestic cats in Guangdong, China, fecal samples were collected from cats with diarrhea in an animal hospital in 2018 to promote research on FeSCV. The FeSCV genome was obtained by PCR amplification and sequencing, and the detected virus was named PY4 (GenBank No. MT732515). The genome of PY4 was 2,034 nt in size, which was 12 nt smaller than the reported genome of Japanese FeSCV strains (KU7, KU8, KU9, KU14) (2,046 nt). The PY4 strain shared 95.1 ~ 95.5% homology with Japanese FeSCV strains. Notably, the Cap protein of PY4 was mutated at 15 amino acid sites, and the PY4 genome contained a unique open reading frame 3. In addition, there were two additional base insertions in the stem-loop structure of PY4, and the nucleotide homology of the spacer region was not high. A phylogenetic tree based on Rep proteins showed that PY4, Japanese FeSCVs and rodent stool-associated circular viruses (RodSCVs) clustered together, suggesting that they might share a similar origin in their phylogenetic evolution. In this study, samples collected in Guangzhou, China, in 2018 were subjected to an etiological investigation, and 20% (2/10) of the samples were positive for FeSCV.

Herein, we investigated the herbivory status of Zn/Cd-hyperaccumulating plant Sedum alfredii from both their natural habitats and their applied remediation field, and inspected the adaptive strategies of the herbivores from the perspective of their facilitative gut microbiota. Field investigations showed that snail species Bradybaena ravida was the dominant herbivore feeding on S. alfredii and they can be only found in sites with lower levels of heavy metals compared with the plant natural habitat. Gut microbial community was analyzed using two sequencing methods (16S rRNA and czcA-Zn/Cd resistant gene) to comparatively understand the effect of gut microbes in facilitating snail feeding on the hyperaccumulators. The results revealed significant differences in the diversity and richness between the gut microbiota of the two snail populations, which was more pronounced by the czcA sequencing method. Despite of the compositional differences, their functions seemed to converge into three categories as metal-tolerant and contaminant degraders, gut symbionts, and pathogens. Further function potentials predicted by Tax4Fun based on 16 S sequencing data were in accordance with this categorization as the most abundant metabolic pathways were two-component system and ABC transporter, which was closely related to metal stress adaptation. The prevalence of positive interactions (~80%) indicated by the co-occurrence network analysis based on czcA sequencing data in both groups of gut microbiota further suggested the facilitative effect of these metal-tolerant gut microbes in coping with the high metal diet, which ultimately assist the snails to successfully feed on S. alfredii plants and thrive.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical database of patients presenting to the ED during the national lockdown period (from 26 March to 30 June 2020). We used the same time interval in the year 2019 as the control period in our analysis. We collected baseline characteristics and outcomes of each patient in the ED. The primary outcome was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the average daily ED visits. Secondary outcomes included the IRR with 95% CI of total admissions and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. RESULTS: The average number of daily ED visits decreased significantly from 89.1 to 57.0 (-36.0%, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.70). However, the proportions of 'Resuscitation' and 'Emergency' triage level were increased (29.1% vs 19.2%, P < 0.001).

In total, 91 volunteers who had been administered with two doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac) were recruited into the study, and then randomised (1:1:1) to received different regimens of the third dose. An intramuscular booster with a full dose of BNT162b2 was included as a conventional control, and a half dose group was included as reciprocal comparator. Both, immediate and delayed adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were monitored. Humoral and cellular immune responses were examined to observe the booster effects. The intradermal booster provided significantly fewer systemic side effects, from 70% down to 19.4% (p < 0.001); however, they were comparable to local reactions with the conventional intramuscular booster. In the intradermal group after receiving only one fifth of the conventional dosage, serum Anti-RBD IgG was halved compared to the full dose of an intramuscular injection. However, the neutralising function against the Delta strain remained intact. T cell responses were also less effective in the intradermal group compared to the intramuscular booster. Together, the intradermal booster, using a fractional dose of BNT162b2, can reduce systemic reactions and provides a good level and function of antibody responses compared to the conventional booster.

These actions should involve the widespread adoption of registered reports, balanced research funding between innovative, incremental and methodological research projects, full recognition and demystification of peer review, mandatory statistical review of reports, adherence to reporting guidelines, and investment in methodological education and research.

Outpatient care and dental care were limited to telephone advice and emergency services. Dental staff is particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 contraction, because of the inevitable contact with patients' body fluids during aerosol-generating procedures. The implementation of diagnostic tests among ambulatory patients could improve the occupational safety among outpatient care personnel. The aim of this review was to introduce information regarding COVID-19 diagnostics with a particular focus on the methods which can be utilized in an outpatient and dental care setting. An online PubMed database review of articles on COVID-19 diagnostics, published on February 12-May 15, 2020, was conducted. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnostics, which determines if a person has an active infection. Unfortunately, its utilization in outpatient care is limited. Serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identify people who were infected, including those who have had an asymptomatic infection, but they do not give sufficient information about the acute infection. Rapid serological assays developed to facilitate testing outside of laboratories, especially in dental offices, are not recommended by the World Health Organization to be used outside research settings, and they should not constitute the basis for clinical decision-making because of frequent false-negative results which may consequently contribute to personnel infections. Out of all available COVID-19 diagnostic methods, rapid serological assays seemed to be a method of choice in outpatient medical care. Unfortunately, their results turned out to be unreliable. The best methods to ensure the occupational safety of medical staff and to avoid cross-infections in outpatient care facilities include a thorough epidemiological interview, temperature measurement to rule out patients with an active infection, and the implementation of strict infection control procedures.

Their ability to access cryptic epitopes conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) and feasibility to engineer modular, multimeric designs, make these antibody fragments ideal candidates for developing broad-spectrum therapeutics against current and continually emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. Here we describe a diverse collection of 37 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein nanobodies extensively characterized as both monovalent and IgG Fc-fused bivalent modalities. The panel of nanobodies were shown to have high intrinsic affinity; high thermal, thermodynamic and aerosolization stability; broad subunit/domain specificity and cross-reactivity across many VoCs; wide-ranging epitopic and mechanistic diversity; high and broad in vitro neutralization potencies; and high neutralization efficacies in hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reducing viral burden by up to six orders of magnitude to below detectable levels. In vivo protection was demonstrated with anti-RBD and previously unreported anti-NTD and anti-S2 nanobodies. This collection of nanobodies provides a therapeutic toolbox from which various cocktails or multi-paratopic formats could be built to tackle current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-related viruses. Furthermore, the high aerosol-ability of nanobodies provides the option for effective needle-free delivery through inhalation.","output":"Arsenal of Nanobodies for Broad-Spectrum Countermeasures against Current and Future SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has is a global health challenge.

Non-pharmaceutical policy interventions, e.g. stay-at-home orders, closing schools, universities, and (non-essential) businesses, are expected to decrease pedestrian flows in public areas, leading to reduced social contacts. The extent to which such interventions show the targeted effect is often measured retrospectively by surveying behavioural changes. Approaches that use data generated through mobile phones are hindered by data confidentiality and privacy regulations and complicated by selection effects. Furthermore, access to such sensitive data is limited. However, a complex pandemic situation requires a fast evaluation of the effectiveness of the introduced interventions aiming to reduce social contacts. Location-based sensor systems installed in cities, providing objective measurements of spatial mobility in the form of pedestrian flows, are suited for such a purpose. These devices record changes in a populations behaviour in real-time, do not have privacy problems as they do not identify persons, and have no selection problems due to ownership of a device. Objective This work aimed to analyse location-based sensor measurements of pedestrian flows in 49 metropolitan areas at 100 locations in Germany to study whether such technology is suitable for the real-time assessment of behavioural changes during a phase of several different pandemic-related policy interventions. Methods Spatial mobility data of pedestrian flows was linked with policy interventions using the date as a unique linkage key. Data was visualised to observe potential changes in pedestrian flows before or after interventions. Furthermore, differences in time series of pedestrian counts between the pandemic and the pre-pandemic year were analysed. Results The sensors detected changes in mobility patterns even before policy interventions were enacted. Compared to the pre-pandemic year, pedestrian counts were 85% lower. Conclusions The study illustrated the practical value of sensor-based real-time measurements when linked with non-pharmaceutical policy intervention data. This studys core contribution is that the sensors detected behavioural changes before enacting or loosening non-pharmaceutical policy interventions. Therefore, such technologies should be considered in the future by policymakers for crisis management and policy evaluation.","output":"Sensing pedestrian flows for real-time assessment of non-pharmaceutical policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is currently no specific prophylaxis or vaccine against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV).

Providing access to prenatal health care while limiting exposure of both obstetric health care professionals and patients to COVID-19 is challenging. Although reductions in the frequency of prenatal visits and implementation of telehealth interventions provide some options, there still remains a need for patient-health care professional visits. A drive-through prenatal care model was developed in which pregnant women would remain in their automobiles while being assessed by the health care professional, thus reducing potential patient, health care professional, and staff exposure to COVID-19. Drive-through prenatal visits would include key elements that some institutions cannot perform by telehealth encounters, such as blood pressure measurements for evaluation for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal heart rate assessment, and selected ultrasound-based measurements or observations, as well as face-to-face patient-health care professional interaction, thereby reducing patient anxiety resulting from the reduction in the number of planned clinic visits with an obstetric health care professional as well as fear of virus exposure in the clinic setting.

Depression and anxiety symptoms increased from pre-pandemic to follow-up, and most participants were above measurement cut-offs for clinical levels during the pandemic. Changes in finances and access to peer gatherings were associated with depression symptoms during the pandemic, but effects depended on level of pre-pandemic depression. For participants with high pre-pandemic depression, financial stability was not protective against increased depression at follow-up. Participants experiencing unprecedentedly high levels of depression during COVID may have pursued more TNB gatherings.

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","output":"Assurer les soins aux patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l'pidmie  SARS-CoV-2./ [Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Populations affected by crises (armed conflict, food insecurity, natural disasters) are poorly covered by demographic surveillance. As such, crisis-wide estimation of population mortality is extremely challenging, resulting in a lack of evidence to inform humanitarian response and conflict resolution. METHODS: We describe here a small-area estimation method to circumvent these data gaps and quantify both total and excess (i.e. crisis-attributable) death rates and tolls, both overall and for granular geographic (e.g. district) and time (e.g. month) strata. The method is based on analysis of data previously collected by national and humanitarian actors, including ground survey observations of mortality, displacement-adjusted population denominators and datasets of variables that may predict the death rate. We describe the six sequential steps required for the methods implementation and illustrate its recent application in Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria, based on a generic set of analysis scripts. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis of ground survey data reveals informative patterns, e.g. concerning the contribution of injuries to overall mortality, or household net migration. Despite some data sparsity, for each crisis that we have applied the method to thus far, available predictor data allow the specification of reasonably predictive mixed effects models of crude and under 5 years death rate, validated using cross-validation. Assumptions about values of the predictors in the absence of a crisis provide counterfactual and excess mortality estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The method enables retrospective estimation of crisis-attributable mortality with considerable geographic and period stratification, and can therefore contribute to better understanding and historical memorialisation of the public health effects of crises.

However, the first wave of COVID-19 took place over a period of nearly six months, while the second wave occurred over three to four months. There is a noticeable surge in COVID-19 incidence observed in April-May 2021. This could indicate the increased infectivity of the virus as observed with the cases doubling rapidly during this time. Documenting the characteristics of the wave in terms of its rapidity of onset of disease and peaks in incidence would offer insight into the progression of COVID-19.","output":"Beyond Diagnostics: The role of a RT-PCR laboratory in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder with variable expressivity and locus heterogeneity. Despite several RAS pathway genes were implicated in NS, 20C30% of patients remain without molecular diagnosis, suggesting the involvement of further genes or multiple mechanisms. Eight patients out of 60, negative for conventional NS mutation analysis, with heterogeneous NS phenotype were investigated by means of target resequencing of 26 RAS/MAPK pathway genes. A trio was further characterized by means of whole-exome sequencing. Protein modeling and in silico prediction of protein stability allowed to identify possible pathogenic RAS pathway variants in four NS patients. A new c.355T>C variant in LZTR1 was found in patient 43. Two patients co-inherited variants in LRP1 and LZTR1 (patient 53), or LRP1 and SOS1 genes (patient 67). The forth patient (56) carried a compound heterozygote of RASAL3 gene variants and also an A2ML1 variant. While these subclinical variants are singularly present in healthy parents, they co-segregate in patients, suggesting their addictive effect and supporting a digenic inheritance, as alternative model to a more common monogenic transmission. The ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK activation state, assessed on immortalized lymphocytes from patients 53 and 67 showed highest phosphorylation levels compared to their asymptomatic parents. These findings together with the lack of their co-occurrence in the 1000Genomes database strengthen the hypothesis of digenic inheritance in a subset of NS patients. This study suggests caution in the exclusion of subclinical variants that might play a pathogenic role providing new insights for alternative hereditary mechanisms.","output":"Digenic inheritance of subclinical variants in Noonan Syndrome patients: an alternative pathogenic model?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may increase end organ perfusion and thus survival when conventional CPR fails. The aim was to investigate, if after ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in rodents ECLS improves outcome compared with conventional CPR. METHODS In 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (460-510 g) resuscitation was started after 10 min of no-flow with ECLS (consisting of an open reservoir, roller pump, and membrane oxygenator, connected to cannulas in the jugular vein and femoral artery, n = 8) or CPR (mechanical chest compressions plus ventilations, n = 8) and compared with a sham group (n = 8). After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), all rats were maintained at 33C for 12 h. Survival to 14 days, neurologic deficit scores and overall performance categories were assessed. RESULTS ECLS leads to sustained ROSC in 8 of 8 (100%) and neurological intact survival to 14 days in 7 of 8 rats (88%), compared with 5 of 8 (63%) and 1 of 8 CPR rats. The median survival time was 14 days (IQR: 14-14) in the ECLS and 1 day (IQR: 0 to 5) for the CPR group (P = 0.004).

The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of CXCL10 to the pathogenesis of experimental septic shock in mice. METHODS: Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringers solution and, in some cases, the broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin. Studies were performed in CXCL10 knockout mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Endpoints included leukocyte trafficking and activation, core body temperature, plasma cytokine concentrations, bacterial clearance and survival. RESULTS: CXCL10 was present at high concentrations in plasma and peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced septic shock. Survival was significantly improved in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to controls. CXCL10KO mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG showed attenuated hypothermia, lower concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) in plasma and lessened natural killer (NK) cell activation compared to control mice. Compared to control mice, bacterial burden in blood and lungs was lower in CXCL10-deficient mice but not in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 IgG plus fluids and Primaxin at 2 or 6 hours after CLP significantly improved survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG under the same conditions.

The objectives of the study are to assess PEMs of geriatric associations' websites and determine whether they are above the GRL recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health. DESIGN: Descriptive and correlational methodology. PEMs from 10 major geriatric associations were assessed for their GRL using 10 scales. Eight of the scales provide a numerical GRL while two of the scales provide a visual representation of the GRLs. Analysis was conducted using Readability Studio 2019.3. SETTING: Analysis was conducted February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Identified 10 geriatric associations and 884 PEMs. MEASUREMENTS: GRLs were measured by 10 validated readability indices: the Degrees of Reading Power and Grade Equivalent test, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook test, Coleman-Liau Index, Gunning Fog Index, New Fog Count, New Dale-Chall readability formula, Ford, Caylor, Sticht scale, Raygor readability estimate graph, and Fry readability graph.

The overarching aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that, in the routine-disrupted environment of the COVID-19, amongst a sample of people living with mood disorders, greater social rhythm disruption would be associated with more severe mood symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a two-wave, multinational survey of 997 participants [Formula: see text] who self-reported a mood disorder diagnosis (i.e., major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder). Respondents completed questionnaires assessing demographics, social rhythmicity (The Brief Social Rhythm Scale), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), sleep quality and diurnal preference (The Sleep, Circadian Rhythms and Mood questionnaire) and stressful life events during the COVID-19 pandemic (The Social Readjustment Rating Scale). RESULTS: The majority of participants indicated COVID-19-related social disruption had affected the regularity of their daily routines to at least some extent (n = 788, 79.1%). As hypothesised, lower social rhythmicity was associated with greater depressive symptoms when tested cross-sectionally (standardised  = ?.25, t = ?7.94, P = 0.000) and when tested using a 2-level hierarchical linear model across two time points (b = ?0.14, t = ?3.46, df = 264, P  0.001).

Statistical modelling and machine learning were used for effect estimation and for hypothesis testing of risk factors, and for prognostic modelling of cardiovascular or pulmonary complications. RESULTS: A cohort of 99 811 participants with PCR test was identified. In a fully adjusted multivariable regression model, dementia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36), type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.14) and obesity (OR = 1.08) were identified as significantly associated with a positive PCR test result.

However, adoption rates of these DTs are considered low. Although previous research has investigated possible reasons for adoption and acceptance of DT, age-based stereotypes (eg, those held by health care professionals) toward the abilities of older adults to use DTs have yet to be considered as possible barriers to adoption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influencing role of ageism in the context of health care professionals attitudes toward older adults abilities to use health care DT. A further goal was to examine if social comparison and stereotype activation affect and moderate this association. METHODS: A new measurement to assess health care professionals attitudes toward older adults using technology (ATOAUT-10) was developed and used in 2 studies. Study 1 involved the development of the ATOAUT-10 scale using a principal component analysis and further examined health care professionals attitudes toward the use of health care DTs and correlations with ageism. Study 2 further explored the correlation between ageism and ATOAUT in an experimental design with health care professionals. RESULTS: In study 1, physiotherapists (N=97) rated older adults as young as 50 years as less able to use health care DT compared to younger adults (P<.001). A multiple regression analysis revealed that higher levels of ageism, beyond other predictors, were predictive of more negative ATOAUT, (=.36; t=3.73; P<.001). In study 2, the salience of age was manipulated. Health care professionals (N=93) were randomly assigned to rate the abilities of a young or old person to use health care DT. Old age salience moderated the correlation between ageism and ATOAUT (R(2)=0.19; F(6,85)=3.35; P=.005), such that higher levels of ageism correlated with more negative ATOAUT in the old age salient condition, but not the young condition. Stereotype activation accounted for health care professionals attitudes more than did the experience of working with older patients or the professionals age. CONCLUSIONS: Negative and ageist attitudes of health care professionals can potentially affect how older adults are viewed in relation to DT and consequently might influence actual use and adoption of technology-based treatment. Future studies should broaden the validation of the ATOAUT-10 scale on more diverse samples and focus on the discriminatory aspect of ageism and self-ageism of older adults. This study calls for a focus on ageism as a determinant of adoption of DT.","output":"Attitudes of Health Care Professionals Toward Older Adults Abilities to Use Digital Technology: Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hospital staff are at the frontline for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Understanding their perception of exposure risk is, therefore, important during the early phase of this pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the perception regarding risk of exposure to COVID-19 among Vietnamese hospital staff in Vietnam. Method: A cross-sectional online study was carried out to collect demographic data and risk exposure perception during the second week of the national lockdown in April 2020 in Vietnam. Seven hundred and forty two hospital staff were recruited using the snowball sampling to answer 5-point Likert scale questions regarding their risk exposure perception. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. Pearson coefficient analysis and multivariable regression models were applied to identify factors associated with the perceived COVID-19 exposure risk. Results: Participants perceived a high risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (score = 3.4, SD = 0.8). They also perceived the workplace response to COVID-19 as inadequate (score = 2.0, SD = 0.5). In particular, participants who worked in the emergency or intensive care departments were more likely to perceive an exposure risk, compared to those in infectious disease control departments (Coef. = ?0.38, 95%CI: ?0.74; ?0.02). Participants from central regions perceived a lower risk of exposure to COVID-19 than those from northern regions (OR = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.28C0.96). Nurses were less likely than doctors to report being at risk of exposure to COVID-19 (OR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.33C0.95). Conclusions: We identified a high level of perceived risk regarding COVID-19 exposure among hospital staff during the unprecedented lockdown period in Vietnam. A comprehensive approach, incorporating improved risk communications, safety training and psychological support programs, for all hospital staff, including nurses and those residing in high population density areas, might further strengthen the national effort to control the pandemic.","output":"Perception Toward Exposure Risk of COVID-19 Among Health Workers in Vietnam: Status and Correlated Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An immigrant woman and nurse describes her experience of ptyalism gravidarum in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"My Experience With Ptyalism Gravidarum During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Febrile travelers may pose a diagnostic challenge for Western physicians who are frequently involved in the assessment of these patients but unfamiliar with tropical diseases.

These virus-driven biochemical events must be separated in space and time from those of the host cell. In recent years, granular structures, known for over a century for rabies virus, were shown to host viral gene function and were named using terms such as viroplasms, replication sites, inclusion bodies, or viral factories (VFs). More recently, these VFs were shown to be liquid-like, sharing properties with membrane-less organelles driven by liquidCliquid phase separation (LLPS) in a process widely referred to as biomolecular condensation. Some of the best described examples of these structures come from negative stranded RNA viruses, where micrometer size VFs are formed toward the end of the infectious cycle. We here discuss some basic principles of LLPS in connection with several examples of VFs and propose a view, which integrates viral replication mechanisms with the biochemistry underlying liquid-like organelles. In this view, viral protein and RNA components gradually accumulate up to a critical point during infection where phase separation is triggered. This yields an increase in transcription that leads in turn to increased translation and a consequent growth of initially formed condensates. According to chemical principles behind phase separation, an increase in the concentration of components increases the size of the condensate. A positive feedback cycle would thus generate in which crucial components, in particular nucleoproteins and viral polymerases, reach their highest levels required for genome replication. Progress in understanding viral biomolecular condensation leads to exploration of novel therapeutics. Furthermore, it provides insights into the fundamentals of phase separation in the regulation of cellular gene function given that virus replication and transcription, in particular those requiring host polymerases, are governed by the same biochemical principles.","output":"Deconstructing virus condensation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A two-step route to MK-4482 (EIDD-2801, 1) was developed consisting of an esterification and hydroxamination of cytidine.

We present the qualitative patient and staff experience results. METHOD: Health Research Authority approval for randomized controlled feasibility trial of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face (control) consultations at community addictions semirural service (2500km2) using a modified Hub-and-Spoke (outreach) model. Adult opioid dependent patients prescribed OST and attending outreach were recruited. Participants received two appointments in randomized group. Telemedicine was delivered using Skype-for-business videoconferencing. Patients attended outreach, saw keyworker for drug testing first, and telemedicine conducted via keyworker's laptop. Addiction prescribers located remotely at Hub. Post-trial research interview conducted assessing patient and staff experience of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face consultations. Data transcribed, inputted to RedCap Cloud and free-text analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. RESULT: Of fifty-nine patient participants, 58 completed a research interview. Patient participants reported similar levels of satisfaction between the Telemedicine and Face to Face groups. The themes generated in relation to Face-to-Face were no difference, easy, kind staff and liking being part of research. For Telemedicine, themes were less travel, good experience, easier to access, good communication, saves time and saves money. For instance, one patient stated Clear, easy to access less travel and another patient stated I struggle with travel. I found it easier. Of 19 staff participant research interviews completed, Staff reported Good or Very Good experience with telemedicine which was equivalent for Face-to-Face consultations. Eleven staff had experience of telemedicine consultations during the trial. They reported similar themes to patients with telemedicine leading to less travel, beneficial to patient care, improves attendance and was innovative technology. One staff member reported satisfaction with telemedicine due to Time, travel and money reduction. When questioned on the downsides to telemedicine, technological issues were mainly related to connection issues and sound issues. CONCLUSION: In the first known RCT of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face consultations for patients with opioid dependence attending prescriber review, we found that both patients and staff were satisfied with telemedicine as compared to face-to-face consultations.

Its death toll is too high, and early diagnosis is the main problem nowadays. Infected people show a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, fever, tastelessness, dry cough, etc. Some other symptoms may also be manifested by radiographic visual identification. Therefore, Chest X-Rays (CXR) play a key role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we use Chest X-Rays images to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of the disease. These images are used to train two deep networks, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) which is an artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The proposed study involves three phases. First, the CNN model is trained on raw CXR images. Next, it is trained on pre-processed CXR images and finally enhanced CXR images are used for deep network CNN training. Geometric transformations, color transformations, image enhancement, and noise injection techniques are used for augmentation. From augmentation, we get 3,220 augmented CXRs as training datasets. In the final phase, CNN is used to extract the features of CXR imagery that are fed to the LSTM model. The performance of the four trained models is evaluated by the evaluation techniques of different models, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, false-positive rate, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: We compare our results with other benchmark CNN models. Our proposed CNN-LSTM model gives superior accuracy (99.02%) than the other state-of-the-art models. Our method to get improved input, helped the CNN model to produce a very high true positive rate (TPR 1) and no false-negative result whereas false negative was a major problem while using Raw CXR images. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude after performing different experiments that some image pre-processing and augmentation, remarkably improves the results of CNN-based models.

Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity.

It is proposed that RIC inhibits cytokine release via a reduction in nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-B)-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome production. In vivo, RIC attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine release in myocardial/cerebral infarction and LPS models of endotoxaemia. In the latter group, cytokine inhibition is associated with a profound survival benefit.

RESULTS Overall in-hospital mortality was 4/29 (14%); 1/12 (8.3%) in group A versus 3/17 (18%) in group B, p = 0.62. No grade-V (lethal) neurological complication occurred, but five patients (all in group B) had grade-IV neurological complications: one general and two each focal and spinal neurological deficit (p = 0.047, overall). Prevalence of grade-II (temporary) general neurological deficit was 17% (group A) versus 27% (group B), p = 0.66. None of the patients suffered  grade-IV respiratory or renal complications. Other complications, biochemical markers, and blood product usage were not significantly different. CONCLUSION Outcomes in TAR with HCA and extended ( 90 min) three-vessel ACP were encouraging and could be contemplated with anticipated time-consuming TAR.","output":"Outcomes of aortic arch repair with extended ( 90 minutes) antegrade cerebral perfusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. During the isolation period of COVID-19, athletes may not train, which leads to an increased risk of injury, which can be slight or more severe depending on their fitness level. Aim of Study. The current study aimed to investigate training exercises and injury prevention programs during the COVID-19 quarantine period among athletes. Material and Methods. A self-administered web-based survey was developed. The survey aimed to obtain information concerning exercises and injury prevention protocols implemented by athletes during the COVID-19 quarantine period. The surveys other goal was to investigate the type of exercises such as running, strength, stretching, plyometrics, balance, or injury prevention programs and the average training time. Data was collected in the period between April to June 2020. Results. A total of 606 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 80% from 132 countries worldwide. Most respondents were male (n = 353, 58.3%), and aged between 30 to 39 years (n = 175, 28.9%). Sixty-one percent of the total sample reported that they had been training during the quarantine period. They consisted of amateur-level (n = 180, 29.7%) and semi-professional athletes (n = 159, 26.2%). Squat, push up, single-leg squat, and side lunges were the top five implemented exercises with an average training time of 30 to 60 minutes. Most injury prevention protocols (18.8%) were reported as non-specified programs, followed by the Knee Injury Prevention Program (KIPP) (12.5%) and the iSPRINT Injury Prevention Program (10.6%). Conclusions. Most athletes continued their training and exercise during the COVID quarantine period to maintain their physical fitness level and reduce injury levels once they resume their regular training. ? 2021, University School of Physical Education.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The mortality rate, hospital disorders and incalculable economic and social damages, besides the unproven efficacy of the treatments evaluated against COVID-19, raised the need for immediate control of this disease. Therefore, the current study employed in silico tools to rationally identify new possible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. That is an enzyme conserved among the coronavirus species; hence, the identification of an Mpro inhibitor is to make it a broad-spectrum drug. Molecular docking studies described the binding sites and the interaction energies of 74 Mpro-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A structural similarity screening was carried out in order to identify possible Mpro ligands that show additional pharmacological properties against COVID-19. We identified 59 hit compounds and among them, melatonin stood out due to its prominent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; it can reduce oxidative stress, defence cell mobility and efficiently combat the cytokine storm and sepsis. In addition, melatonin is an inhibitor of calmodulin, an essential intracellular component to maintain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface. Interestingly, one of the most promising hits in our docking study was melatonin. It revealed better interaction energy with Mpro compared to ligands in complexes from PDB. Consequently, melatonin can have response potential in early stages for its possible effects on ACE-2 and Mpro, although it is also promising in more severe stages of the disease for its action against hyper-inflammation. These results definitely do not confirm antiviral activity, but can rather be used as a basis for further preclinical and clinical trials.","output":"COVID-19: Rational discovery of the therapeutic potential of Melatonin as a SARS-CoV-2 main Protease Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a pandemic.

The main aim of this study is to determine PTSD in healthcare workers (HCWs) who survived COVID-19 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Subjects and methods Through an analytical cross-sectional study, HCWs working in Jeddah city with a minimum of seven days since their first positive COVID-19 result were included in this study. They were screened using the 'PTSD checklist for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)' (PCL-5), which is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Results Out of all respondents (n=404), there was slight dominance of females (54.0%) over males (46.0%), and an almost equal distribution of Saudis (51.2%) and non-Saudis (48.8%); their mean age accounted for 36.98.7 years. PTSD was detected in 14.9%; the prevalence was significantly higher in those who had chronic diseases (23.7%), especially diabetics (30.8%) and obesity (41.2%), HCWs whose job necessitates exposure to positive cases (18.8%), and those who were isolated in hospitals while being ill.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate intestinal injury after ischemia and reperfusion with and without antibiotic coverage. Under ether anesthesia forty-two Wistar male rats were submitted to an abdominal midline incision. The mesenteric arteries were clamped for 30 minutes. After this period of ischemia, reperfusion was induced for equal period of time. Twenty-one rats received eritromicin, 50mg/kg orally, 24 hours before the operation. The remain animals were operated without antibiotics coverage. Each of the two groups animals were divided into 3 others groups: control, ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion groups. After the reperfusion period, a intestinal segment was excised for histopathological studies. Results were evaluated according to the criteria of CHIU and col. and were submitted to statical analysis. In the control group any difference was found in the intestines of the animals with and without antibiotic coverage. The ischemia group, with or without antibiotic, showed lesions that ranged from vilos loss to mucosal infarction. The lesions were similar in the ischemia-reperfusion group. We verified that intestines submitted to reperfusion under antibiotic coverage showed more severe lesions than ischemic intestines without antibiotics coverage (p= 0,0303).

Accordingly, the present research seeks to understand what types of leadership employees think is most important for supervisors to exhibit when managing these crisis-related contexts and, in light of assertions that women may be better leaders during times of crisis, examines gender differences in how male and female supervisors act and how subordinates perceive and evaluate them in real (Study 1) and hypothetical (Study 2) settings. Results indicate that communal leader behaviors were more important to employees in all three crisis contexts. In Study 1, communality was a stronger predictor than agency of supervisor likability and competence. In Study 2, communality was also more positively related to likability, but agency and communality were equally predictive of competence ratings. Ratings of real supervisors suggest that women were not more communal than men when managing these crises, nor did perceptions of leader behavior differ by supervisor gender in a controlled experiment. However, evaluations of women's competence were more directly related to their display of communal behaviors than were evaluations of male supervisors.

But research ethics committees or institutional review boards (IRBs) have also been criticized for being barriers to research. This article examines the case of the Philippines, where little has been done to interrogate the health research and IRB culture, and whose circumstances can serve as reflection points for other low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted from July to October 2020 to elicit health researchers perspectives and experiences regarding IRBs and the ethics approval process in the country, as well as counterpoint narratives from researchers who have also worked for IRBs. RESULTS: Across the fields of clinical, public health, and social science research, the issue of ethics review revealed itself to be foremost an issue of inequity. IRB processes serve as a barrier for those outside the academe; those belonging to institutions, cities, or entire regions without their own accredited IRBs; and researchers working independently, without ample budget, or on highly specialized topicsmore so for non-clinical researchers who must grapple with the primarily biomedical framework of most IRBs. Consequently, the research landscape invariably favors those with the resources to do research, and researches that tend to attract funding. CONCLUSION: The broader challenge of equity in health research will entail more fundamental reforms, but proximal interventions can be done to make the ethics approval process more equitable, such as enhancing institutional oversight, regulating IRB fees, and enabling a more supportive and welcoming environment for early-career, student, independent, and non-clinical health researchers.

Despite recent data suggesting that a transcriptionally similar population of KRM-like cells is present across species, the idea that they are self-renewing and independent of peripheral blood input in other species has yet to be proven due to the lack of an appropriate model and cross-species expression markers. In this study, we use our recently identified cross-species KRM cell surface markers and parabiosis surgery in inbred Lewis rats to determine if rat KRM are maintained independent of peripheral blood input, similar to their mouse counterparts. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that parabiosis surgery in the rat results in establishment of chimerism of T/B cells, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages in the blood, spleen, and kidney three weeks post parabiosis surgery. Analysis of KRM using the cell surface markers CD81 or C1q indicates that these cells have minimal chimerism and, therefore, receive little input from the peripheral blood. Thus, a putative KRM population in the rat identified using two novel cross-species markers is maintained with minimal input from the peripheral blood confirming that KRM properties are conserved in at least two different species.","output":"Kidney resident macrophages in the rat have minimal turnover and replacement by blood monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe public health crisis has been declared worldwide since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was classified as a pandemic of acute respiratory infectious disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Controversies exist regarding the value of several diagnostic tests. This systematic review aims to evaluate current literature and amplify an up-to-date evidence-based approach to NF-pNET diagnosis in MEN1. Three databases were systematically searched on the diagnostic value of biomarkers and imaging modalities. Twenty-seven studies were included and critically appraised (modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). Another 12 studies, providing data on age-related penetrance and tumor growth, were included to assess the optimal frequency and timing of screening. Based on current literature, biomarkers should no longer play a role in the diagnostic process for NF-pNETs, as accuracies are too low. Studies evaluating the diagnostic value of imaging modalities are heterogeneous with varying risks of bias. For the detection of NF-pNETs, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has the highest sensitivity. A combined strategy of EUS and MRI seems to be the most useful. Gallium 68 octreotate-DOTA positron emission tomography-CT could be added if NF-pNETs are diagnosed to identify metastasis. Reported growth rates were generally low, and two distinct phenotypes were observed. Surveillance programs should focus on and be adapted to the presence of substantial growth in NF-pNETs.

We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days.

Objective To evaluate the association of SYG laws with homicide and firearm homicide, nationally and by state, while considering variation by the race, age, and sex of individuals who died by homicide. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used a controlled, multiple-baseline and -location interrupted time series design, using natural variation in the timings and locations of SYG laws to assess associations. Changes in homicide and firearm homicide were modeled using Poisson regression analyses within a generalized additive model framework. Analyses included all US states that enacted SYG laws between 2000 and 2016 and states that did not have SYG laws enacted during the full study period, 1999 to 2017. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to December 2020. Exposures SYG self-defense laws enacted by statute between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were statewide monthly rates of homicide and firearm-related homicide (per 100 000 persons) from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, grouped by characteristics (ie, race, age, sex) of individuals who died by homicide. Results Forty-one states were analyzed, including 23 states that enacted SYG laws during the study period and 18 states that did not have SYG laws, with 248 358 homicides (43.7% individuals aged 20-34 years; 77.9% men and 22.1% women), including 170 659 firearm homicides. SYG laws were associated with a mean national increase of 7.8% in monthly homicide rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR],1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12; P < .001) and 8.0% in monthly firearm homicide rates (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; P = .002).

A 100-mL water sample is combined with 10 mL of a high ionic strength, low-pH, citrate buffer, mixed well, and the dissolved CO2 concentration is measured directly. The DIC is then calculated based on the dissolved CO2 concentration, buffer-controlled ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the mixture. The method was accurate, precise, and comparable to standard laboratory analytical methods when tested using prepared sodium bicarbonate solutions up to 40 mM DIC, North Atlantic seawater, commercial bottled waters, and carbonate spring waters. Coal mine drainage waters were also tested and often contained higher DIC concentrations in the field than in subsequent laboratory measurements; the greatest discrepancy was for the high-CO2 samples, suggesting that degassing occurred after sample collection. For chemically unstable waters and low-pH waters, such as those from high-CO2 mine waters, the proposed field DIC method may enable the collection of DIC data that are more representative of natural settings.","output":"A Field-Based Method for Determination of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon in Water Based on CO2 and Carbonate Equilibria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug resistance represents a great concern among people with cystic fibrosis (CF), due to the recurrent and prolonged antibiotic therapy they should often undergo.

In this cross-sectional study we examined if perceived social support, exercise in minutes per week and change in exercise are protective factors regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeping disorders. Method: In April 2020, n = 4271 German adults completed an online survey including mental health questionnaires regarding depression (PHQ-D), anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep (PSQI), as well as questionnaires related to protective factors such as exercise (BSA-F), physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) and social support (F-SozU). Results: Complete case analysis (n = 3700; mean age 33.13 {+/-} 11.73 years, 78.6 % females) resulted in elevated prevalence of depressive disorder (31.4%), panic disorder (5.7%) and other anxiety disorders (7.4%). 58.3% reported symptoms of insomnia. Three separate models of multiple regression were conducted. Perceived social support was associated with lower values of anxiety (beta = -0.10; t(19) = -6.46; p >0.001), lower values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.22; t(19) = -15.71; p < .001) and lower values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.15; t(19) = -9.55; p < .001). Change towards less exercise compared to the time before Covid-19 was associated with and higher values of anxiety (beta = -0.05; t(19) = -2.85; p= .004), higher values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.08; t(19) = -5.69; p < .001), and higher values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.07; t(19) = -4.54; p < .000). Post-hoc analysis (ANOVAs) revealed that a change towards less exercise was significantly associated with more depressive, anxiety and sleeping disorder symptoms whereas a positive change was not. No significant association was found for exercise in minutes per week for all outcomes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a negative impact on mental health in the German population. Social Support and a stable amount of exercise might attenuate these negative mental health consequences. Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the pandemic on mental health and possible protective factors is needed in order to create a basis for the development of appropriate prevention and intervention measures.","output":"Associations of exercise and social support with mental health during quarantine and social-distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is now preoccupied by the COVID-19 pandemic even though the vaccine has now been found, but the spread rate is still high, Indonesia is included.

Here, European seabass acclimatized at 3, 6, 12, and 30 PSU were subjected to 20 days of an ambient extreme winter cold event (8 C), and monitored for growth and physiological performance. Growth performance decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU compared to 6 and 12 PSU. During cold stress exposure, serum Na+, Cl-, and K+ concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in fish exposed at 30 PSU. Serum cortisol, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were increased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU. In contrast, opposite trends were observed for serum protein, lactate, and triglycerides content during cold exposure. Transaminase activities [glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl-transaminase (GGT)] were significantly higher in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU on days 10 and 20.

Only one miRNA, hsa-miR-210-3p, was upregulated in all experimental conditions, while there were nine differentially expressed miRNAs under both treatments within the same cell line. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed a complex hypoxia-induced regulatory network: hypoxic downregulation of hsa-miR-148a-3p led to the upregulation of its two target genes, ITGA5 and PRNP, which was shown to be a factor contributing to tumor progression and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients.","output":"Hypoxia-Induced miR-148a Downregulation Contributes to Poor Survival in Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data sets published for public consumption related to governance typically contain common metadata This metadata normally describes the publishing organisation, the domain, the administrative region and a topic that the data best describes A relevant semantic vocabulary will not only facilitate linking the metadata through meaningful contexts but also enable grounding related information from diverse public data sets using semantic entities defining the metadata In this paper, we present Bharathi -Linked Data Vocabulary for the Indian context Bharathi contains information regarding government organisations at the union & state government level, administrative regions, sectors, sub sectors and common topics used frequently in the vocabulary of the government functions Further, Bharathi contains links to other open vocabularies such as GeoNames for geographical locations The schema of Bharathi uses existing established ontologies making it inter-operable and extensible We describe Bharathi along with a live use case of its application in accomplishing a semantic Covid19 data analysis for India ? 2021 CEUR-WS All rights reserved","output":"Bharathi-an applied semantic intelligence use case for public data in india"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the processing of infectious bronchitis virus polyproteins, several candidate regions of the genome have been cloned and expressed in vitro.

The intention was to provide information in a format that enabled an examination of the population data and highlight any inequality in provision. Data were mapped onto the indices of multiple deprivation, and a range of text and graphical methods were used to represent the population data to the hospital leadership. The visual representation of the demographics and deprivation of people discharged during a critical period of the pandemic was intended to support planning for community services.

This destruction could target melanocytes anywhere in the body, which could affect function of organs where they reside. Melanocytes in the skin, uveal tract and ear are similar in their physiology and morphology and share a common embryologic origin. OBJECTIVES: The present work aimed to study the association of vitiligo with ocular and auditory abnormalities. METHODS: This case-control study was carried out on forty vitiligo patients and twenty normal healthy controls. All patients and controls were subjected to auditory examination (Otoscopic examination and immittancemetry, pure tone audiometery to assess peripheral hearing sensitivity and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) to assess central hearing ability) and standard ocular examination including: visual acuity test, slit lamp biomicroscopy , and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: There was significant higher prevalence of hearing loss in vitiligo patients than controls. Ocular abnormalities were found to be significant higher in vitiligo patients but no significant difference regarding visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Vitiligo is a systemic disease and could be associated with impairment of melanocytes function in other organs including the eyes and ears. Auditory melanocytes function is related to hearing process and thus their destruction could lead to hearing impairment yet ocular melanocytes don't play direct role in detection or transfer of visual information. Vitiligo could be associated with ocular abnormalities and hearing loss.","output":"Ocular and auditory abnormalities in vitiligo patients: A case- control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases (isirv) held its 4th Antiviral Group Conference at the University of Texas on 2C4 June, 2015. With emerging resistance to the drugs currently licensed for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza viruses, primarily the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, and the lack of effective interventions against other respiratory viruses, the 3-day programme focused on the discovery and development of inhibitors of several virus targets and key host cell factors involved in virus replication or mediating the inflammatory response.

The purpose of this study was to examine how people in Canada who gave birth during the pandemic were affected by policies aimed at limiting interpersonal contact to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospital and during the early weeks postpartum. METHODS: We took a social constructionist approach and used a qualitative descriptive methodology. Sampling methods were purposive and involved a mix of convenience and snowball sampling via social media and email. Study inclusion was extended to anyone aged 18 years or more who was located in Canada and was pregnant or had given birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained via semistructured qualitative telephone interviews conducted between June 2020 and January 2021, and were analyzed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-five interviews were conducted; data from 57 women who had already delivered were included in our analysis. We identified the following 4 themes: negative postpartum experience in hospital owing to the absence of a support person(s); poor postpartum mental health, especially in women with preexisting mental health conditions and those who had had medically complicated deliveries; asking for help despite public health regulations that prohibited doing so; and problems with breastfeeding owing to limited in-person follow-up care and lack of in-person breastfeeding support. INTERPRETATION: Policies that restrict the presence of support persons in hospital and at home during the postpartum period appear to be causing harm. Measures to mitigate the consequences of these policies could include encouraging pregnant people to plan for additional postpartum support, allowing a support person to remain for the entire hospital stay and offering additional breastfeeding support.","output":"Women's postpartum experiences in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although most neonates with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have mild disease, the impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes is unknown. This study aimed to assess 18-month neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of neonates diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between June to August 2020 through nasopharyngeal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR testing. A total of 58 neonates were identified from the Kuwait national COVID-19 registry and were enrolled. Historical controls were selected from the neonatal follow-up registry and matched 2:1 based on sex and gestational age. At 18 months of age, neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-3rd Edition (BSID-III) by two trained assessors. Results: A total of 40 children were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included in the final analysis. The median age at infection was 18 days (range: 10-26 days). Eighteen (45%) were asymptomatic, 15 (37.5%) had a sepsis-like presentation, 5 (12.5%) had respiratory distress and 2 (5%) had a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)-like presentation. At 18 months follow up, only one child had severe developmental delay, and one child had a language delay. BSID-III outcomes did not significantly differ between the SARS-CoV-2 infected group and the control group.

Methods: All dental employees (dentists, nurses, data entry/cleaning staff) working in a university dental clinic were invited to the study and eighty-one employees (response rate: 97.5%) participated in the study. The volunteers' anxiety was measured consecutively twice with the State-Trait Anxiety Scale: First, on the day prior to restarting the high-risk procedures and the second, on the day these procedures began. Data were analyzed using t tests and the repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The state anxiety level of the dental employees increased significantly on the day that the high risk procedures were restarted (mean 42.6 vs. 49.0, d = 0.6, P < 0.001). Concerning the subgroups, the increase in state anxiety levels was significant for females (t = 3,7; d = 0,8; P < 0.001), dentists working in departments of endodontics and restorative dental care (t = 3,5; d = 0,9; P < 0.001) and nurses (t = 2,8; d = 0,9; P < 0.001).

The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (?24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (?17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.","output":"Remdesivir MD Simulations Suggest a More Favourable Binding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Mutant P323L Than Wild-Type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver cancer ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. To date, neither current ablation therapy nor chemotherapy are considered ideal in improving the outcome of liver cancer. Therefore, more effective therapies for treating this devastating disease are urgently required. Interventional therapy has been used for numerous years in the treatment of different types of cancer, and is characterized by the direct delivery of anticancer drugs into the tumor. It has been reported that antimalarial chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) exerts effective anticancer activity against several types of cancer. However, its effect on liver cancer remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, 2D monolayer cell culture and 3D spheroid in vitro models, and a rat model, were utilized to investigate the effect of CQ on liver cancer. CQ demonstrated an effective anticancer effect on HepG2 cells and 3D liver spheroids. Furthermore, the drug significantly inhibited cell growth and viability in the 2D and 3D in vitro models. The CQ-based intervention treatment effectively attenuated tumor size and weight, increased food intake and consumption of drinking water, and improved body weight and survival rate of rats in the in vivo model. In addition, treatment with CQ potently increased the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes.

In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 63 vs 36.2 67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination. CONCLUSIONS: To maintain ERT, FD patients prefer home infusions or those given in the nearest hospital, especially during a pandemic.","output":"Is home-based therapy in Fabry disease the answer to compelling patients' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Specifically, the study investigates how the school's physical/virtual learning system was (re)configured to provide new opportunities for learning to a thousand\\\\plus population of primary and secondary students, and how they reacted to the transition to distance learning in terms of participation, autonomy, motivation and engagement. The research adopts a mixed method approach, based on school management system data and a survey tool, and analyses the students response to the emergency from the perspectives of the students themselves, their teachers and their parents. While these converged in positive evaluation of the experience, a number of lessons were learnt, such as the importance of building on favourable pre\\\\existing conditions and leveraging a solid shared school culture to promote a prompt reaction to the emergency. Significantly, students with an immigrant background displayed varying degrees of participation in online activities.

We aimed to assess the consistency of national and international surgical society recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach; assess the quality of evidence of viral emission in surgical aerosol; and assess the quality of evidence comparing aerosol generation by different surgical energy devices. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was performed. Three search strategies were employed. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final analysis and quality appraised. Confidence in review findings was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) tool. RESULTS: Worldwide recommendations regarding open versus laparoscopic surgery are consistent, with a majority recommending that surgical approach is decided on a case-by-case, risk minimization approach. There is limited, low-quality evidence that viral particles can be emitted in surgical aerosol. There is a paucity of literature on the quantity of aerosol produced by different surgical energy devices, and no evidence to support the use of certain surgical instruments to minimize aerosol production. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable consistency among worldwide recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach, although the evidence base is lacking. To inform clinical recommendations, further research examining viral emission, transmission, infectivity and amount of surgical aerosol produced is required.","output":"Consistency of global recommendations regarding open versus laparoscopic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome-coronavirus (SADS-CoV) are three emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses (CoVs).

To date, strict biosecurity is still the most effective disease prevention and control measures, and the early detection of pathogens is the most important link. Here, we developed a microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system for the first time, which could detected PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV simultaneously, and had advantages of rapid, simple, sensitive, high-throughput, and accurate at point-of-care settings.

AIM: To quantify the time GPs spend on different activities during clinical sessions; to identify the number of operational failures they encounter; and to characterise the nature of operational failures and their impact for GPs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Mixed-method triangulation study with 61 GPs in 28 NHS general practices in England from December 2018 to December 2019. METHOD: TimeCmotion methods, ethnographic observations, and interviews were used. RESULTS: TimeCmotion data on 7679 GP tasks during 238 hours of practice in 61 clinical sessions suggested that operational failures were responsible for around 5.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5% to 5.4%) of all tasks undertaken by GPs and accounted for 3.9% (95% CI = 3.2% to 4.5%) of clinical time. However, qualitative data showed that timeCmotion methods, which depend on pre-programmed categories, substantially underestimated operational failures. Qualitative data also enabled further characterisation of operational failures, extending beyond those measured directly in the timeCmotion data (for example, interruptions, deficits in equipment/supplies, and technology) to include problems linked to GPs coordination role and weaknesses in work systems and processes. The impacts of operational failures were highly consequential for GPs experiences of work. CONCLUSION: GPs experience frequent operational failures, disrupting patient care, impairing experiences of work, and imposing burden in an already pressurised system. This better understanding of the nature and impact of operational failures allows for identification of targets for improvement and indicates the need for coordinated action to support GPs.","output":"Identifying how GPs spend their time and the obstacles they face: a mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

The clinical manifestations of DAVFs vary widely and depend on the location and venous drainage pattern of arteriovenous shunting. Patients with high grade DAVFs having cortical venous reflux should receive aggressive treatment to prevent the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage and other neurological deficits related to venous congestion. Intra-arterial or intravenous endovascular embolization remains the primary therapy for high grade DAVF, while open surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as alternative treatment options.

Preemptive school closures (PSCs), an NPI reserved for use in severe pandemics, are highly effective in slowing influenza spread but have unintended consequences. We simulated PSC impacts during a 1957-like pandemic to estimate population impacts and quantify costs of closing schools at the national level. We also simulated 1957-like, 1968-like, and 2009-like pandemics at the Chicago regional level. We estimated economic impacts resulting from loss of income due to illness, providing childcare during closures, and other PSC costs while taking into consideration the number of cases averted with each mitigation strategy. The estimated net PSC costs ranged from $15 billion to $192 billion (2016 USD) (1957-like, national level) where between 2.3 and 47 million US cases may be averted depending on strategy. We found that 2-week school-by-school PSCs (as opposed to county-wide or school district-wide ones) had the lowest cost per discounted life-year gained for both national and Chicago regional-level analyses of all pandemics. While feasibility of such spatiotemporally precise triggering is presently questionable for most locales, this is, theoretically, an attractive option early in an outbreak, while assessing transmissibility and severity of a novel influenza virus. In contrast, we found that county-wide PSCs of longer durations (8 to 12 weeks) would result in the most averted cases (31-47 million) and deaths (105,000-156,000), albeit at considerably more cost ($125-$150 billion net of averted illness costs) for the national-level, 1957-like analysis. The estimated net costs per death averted ($1.0 to $1.2 million) for these scenarios compare favorably to the range of values recommended for regulatory impact analyses ($4.6 to 15.0 million). Hence, economic benefits of such PSCs would exceed the population impacts and economic costs.","output":"Economics of Implementing Preemptive School Closures to Mitigate Pandemic Influenza Outbreaks of Differing Severity in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic faces a number of challenges for healthcare professionals The virus is spread by droplet infection and has a high virulence, so any intervention that involves the formation of respiratory aerosols potentially endangers the health of those involved in care Mortality from coronavirus infection can be as high as 10%, so resuscitation is common in COVID-19 patients During resuscitation, the likelihood of airway aerosol formation is increased, so there is a high risk of infection for care staff The aim of our article is to provide a practice-oriented overview of the specialties of resuscitation in patients infected with coronavirus Orv Hetil 2020;161 (17): 710-712","output":"[Special aspects of in-hospital resuscitation of COVID-19 patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a coronavirus that is transmitted primarily via aerosol, droplets or direct contact.

Methods: TCMSP databases were used to search the chemical composition and target of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, which was composed of Isatidis Radix, Polygonum cuspidatum, Forsythia suspensa, Phragmitis Rhizoma, Patrinia, Verbena officinalis, Bupleurum chinense, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. The Swiss target prediction database was used to remove the target with possibility of 0. The corresponding targets of the disease were searched in the GeneCards and OMIM databases with the key words of \\"coronavirus\\", \\"pneumonia\\", \\"cough\\", and \\"fever\\". Through the UniProt databases to correct the name of the target point, take the intersection of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule and the disease target point, then use the software of Cytoscape 3.7.2 to build the network of traditional Chinese medicine-compound-target for visualization, through DAVID databases to carry out the GO function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, predict the interaction mechanism of the target, and draw the column and bubble chart for visualization. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase was then docking with all compounds and the first five compounds with the least binding energy were selected for docking with angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Results: The traditional Chinese medicine-compound-target compound target network contains eight kinds of traditional Chinese medicine-compound-target, 157 compounds and 260 corresponding targets. The key targets were PTGS2, ESR1, AR, etc. There were 393 items in GO functional enrichment analysis (P &lt; 0.05), and 139 signaling pathways in KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Molecular docking results showed that SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2 binding energy of the five core compounds, including 6-(3-oxoindolin-2-ylidene) indolo [2,1-b] quinazolin-12-one, bicuculline, physciondiglucoside, dihydroverticillatine, and licoisoflavanone, was smaller than that of recommended chemical drugs, and the binding energy to ACE2 was similar to that of the recommended chemical drug.

Many clawed frog species belonging to the Xenopus genus have diverged from the allotetraploid ancestor created by the hybridization of two closely related species with the predicted L and S genomes. There are species-specific repeated sequences including transposable elements in each genome of organisms that reproduce sexually. To understand what happened on and after the hybridization of the two distinct systems consisting of repeated sequences and their corresponding piRNAs, we isolated small RNAs from ovaries and testes of three Xenopus species consisting of allotetraploid X. laevis and X. borealis and diploid X. tropicalis as controls. After a comprehensive sequencing and selection of piRNAs, comparison of their sequences showed that most piRNA sequences were different between the ovaries and testes in all three species. We compared piRNA and genome sequences and specified gene clusters for piRNA expression in each genome. The synteny and homology analyses showed many distinct piRNA clusters among the three species and even between the two L and/or S subgenomes, indicating that most clusters of the two allotetraploid species changed after hybridization. Moreover, evolutionary analysis showed that DNA transposons including Kolobok superfamily might get activated just after hybridization and then gradually inactivated.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care, academic medical center in Nashville, TN. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure admitted to the adult ICU without venous thromboembolism at the time of ICU admission. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was development of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism was defined by clinical imaging or autopsy, demonstrating deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Forty consecutive critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were enrolled; 37 (92.5%) were hypercoagulable by at least one thromboelastography parameter at the time of ICU admission and 12 (30%) met the primary outcome of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Patients who developed venous thromboembolism had decreased measures of clotting (maximum amplitude, alpha angle, shear elastic modulus parameter, and clotting index) on ICU admission thromboelastography compared with patients who did not develop venous thromboembolism (p < 0.05 for all measures). For each individual thromboelastography parameter used to dichotomize patients as hypercoagulable, the rate of venous thromboembolism was not higher in those identified as hypercoagulable; in fact, the venous thromboembolism rate was higher in patients who were not hypercoagulable by thromboelastography for maximum amplitude (p = 0.04) and alpha angle (p = 0.001). Platelet count was positively correlated with maximum amplitude, alpha angle, G parameter, and clotting index, and significantly lower in patients who developed venous thromboembolism than those who did not (median 186 vs 278 10(3)/L, p = 0.046). Venous thromboembolism was associated with inhospital mortality (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.4C29; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the use of thromboelastography to risk stratify critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 for the development of venous thromboembolism or to guide decisions about anticoagulation.

While countries such as China have successfully curbed the domestic outbreak of the virus with various restrictive and preventive measures, the challenge of avoiding imported cases remains. More importantly, it is still unclear to what extent these implemented aviation emergency responses have effectively mitigated the transmission risk of the virus. This paper provides an empirical assessment of aviation responses to the control of imported COVID-19 cases, with a focus on the following three strategies: the circuit breaker policy, the negative Nucleic Acid testing (NAT), and the double negative tests requirement. Non-recursive structural equation models (SEM) with latent variables were applied to detailed international flight data and individual epidemic survey data of Guangzhou, China, between May 1 and November 30, 2020. The results show that the double negative tests measure has a positive effect on eliminating the number of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, while the effects of single circuit breaker and its co-intervention with negative NAT are conterproductive. This study provides important implications to civil aviation agencies in regard to medium and long-term risk control of imported cases. Specifically, although the circuit breaker mechanism was designed to target on the risk control of imported COVID-19 cases, it may be more effective to carefully maintain a timely and reliable pre-boarding screening and testing to curb the number of imported cases.","output":"The effect of aviation responses to the control of imported COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the evolution of the book retailing industry in the mainland area of the Peoples Republic of China since the late 1970s.

The current policy in the United Kingdom emphasizes the role of schools for mental health promotion and prevention, but little data exist on what aspects of schools influence mental health in pupils. This study explored school-level influences on the mental health of young people in a large school-based sample from the United Kingdom. METHOD: Baseline data from a large cluster randomized controlled trial collected between 2016 and 2018 from mainstream secondary schools selected to be representative in relation to their quality rating, size, deprivation, mixed or single-sex pupil population, and country were analyzed. Participants were pupils in their first or second year of secondary school. The study assessed whether school-level factors were associated with pupil mental health. RESULTS: The study included 26,885 pupils (response rate = 90%; age range, 11?14 years; 55% female) attending 85 schools in the United Kingdom. Schools accounted for 2.4% (95% CI: 2.0%?2.8%; p < .0001) of the variation in psychopathology, 1.6% (95% CI: 1.2%?2.1%; p < .0001) of depression, and 1.4% (95% CI: 1.0%?1.7%; p < .0001) of well-being. Schools in urban locations, with a higher percentage of free school meals and of White British, were associated with poorer pupil mental health. A more positive school climate was associated with better mental health. CONCLUSION: School-level variables, primarily related to contextual factors, characteristics of pupil population, and school climate, explain a small but significant amount of variability in mental health of young people.

METHODS: The expression and function of PD-1 molecules on immune and kidney parenchymal cells were reviewed in the healthy kidney, PD-1 immunotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, glomerulopathies and RCC. RESULTS: PD-1 and/or its ligands are expressed on kidney macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Vitamin D3, glutathione and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulate hypoxic cell signals involved in the expression and function of PD-1 molecules. These pathways are altered in kidney disease and are linked to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-23, and chemokines that bind CXCR3, CXCR4, and/or CXCR7.

Both TLR2 and TLR4 have been shown to augment platelet activation and alter its function from a hemostatic regulator to an immune sentinel. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4 and platelets. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of TLR2 and TLR4 were related to thrombocytopenia and coagulation failure in Chinese patients with sepsis. BASIC METHODS: Adult Chinese patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit of a university medical center were monitored for up to 28 days. Thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), diagnosed using Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) criteria, were observed as the primary outcomes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR2 (rs111200466, rs5743708) and TLR4 (rs11536889, rs145801336, rs11536896, rs7869402) in patients with sepsis were detected by polymerase chain reaction. The data were analyzed using chi-square and rank sum tests. RESULTS: The genotype of TLR2 (rs111200466) (Del/Del) was associated with the initial DIC.

During surgery, the spinous processes of C2 and C7 are usually preserved to keep the insertion points of the cervical musculature and nuchal ligament intact. In this regard, dome-like laminectomy (undercutting of C7 lamina) instead of laminoplasty is performed on C7 in selected cases. However, resection of the lamina can weaken the C7 lamina, and stress fractures may occur, but this complication has not been characterized in the literature. The objective of the present study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for C7 laminar fracture after C7 dome-like laminectomy and its impact on clinical and radiological outcomes. METHODS: Patients who underwent cervical open-door laminoplasty combined with C7 dome-like laminectomy (n=123) were classified according to the presence of C7 laminar fracture. Clinical parameters (neck/arm pain score and neck disability index) and radiologic parameters (C2C7 angle, C2C7 sagittal vertical axis, and C7CT1 angle) were compared between the groups preoperatively and at postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Risk factors for complications were evaluated, and a formula estimating C7 fracture risk was suggested. RESULTS: C7 lamina fracture occurred in 32/123 (26%) patients and occurred at the bilateral isthmus in 29 patients and at the spinolaminar junction in three patients. All fractures appeared on X-ray within 3 months postoperatively, but patients did not present any neurological deterioration. The fracture spontaneously healed in 27/32 (84%) patients at 1 year and in 29/32 (91%) at 2 years. During follow-up, clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. However, patients with C7 fractures showed a more lordotic C2C7 angle and kyphotic C7CT1 angle than patients without C7 fractures. C7 fracture was significantly associated with the extent of bone removal. By incorporating significant factors, the probability of C7 laminar fracture could be assessed with the formula 'Risk score = 1.08  depth (%) + 1.03  length (%, of the posterior height of C7 vertebral body)', and a cut-off value of 167.9% demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 65.1% (area under the curve, 0.81). CONCLUSION: C7 laminar fracture can occur after C7 dome-like laminectomy when a substantial amount of lamina is resected. Although C7 fractures may not cause deleterious clinical outcomes, they can lead to an unharmonized cervical curvature.

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.","output":"Immunodepletion with Hypoxemia: A Potential High Risk Subtype of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper has discussed cybersecurity threats and their mitigation of measures to be taken in the healthcare sector.

DESIGN: A step-by-step methodology was conducted following guidelines. Four databases were searched. A total of 3343 papers were identified. A final yield of 35 articles were retained for analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified four types of aetiologies to describe the hyperacusic population in AEP studies; developmental disorders (n = 19), neurological disorders (n = 3), induced hearing damage (n = 8) and idiopathic aetiology (n = 5). Electrophysiological measures were of short (n = 16), middle (n = 13) and long (n = 19) latencies, believed to reflect the activity of the ascending and descending pathways of the auditory system from periphery to cortex.

They can also adopt measures to uniformly diminish the contact rate between infected and susceptible individuals at an economic cost. Total or partial immunity is modeled, while the contact rate is allowed to exhibit seasonality. We apply optimal control methods to minimize a cost index while guaranteeing that health system capacity is not exceeded. A reasonable parameter selection leads to policies specifying that vaccination priority should be given to the category with a higher demand for the limited health care resources regardless of cost variations among categories. Vaccination priority reverses if some demographic category has significantly higher mobility while for some parameter values vaccination alternates among categories.

Manual diagnosis, however, is considered slow and is limited by the differing opinions of experts and other factors. Thus, this work aimed to develop diagnostic systems for two Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Databases (ALL_IDB1 and ALL_IDB2) for the early detection of leukemia. All images were optimized before being introduced to the systems by two overlapping filters: the average and Laplacian filters. This study consists of three proposed systems as follows: the first consists of the artificial neural network (ANN), feed forward neural network (FFNN), and support vector machine (SVM), all of which are based on hybrid features extracted using Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Fuzzy Color Histogram (FCH) methods. Both ANN and FFNN reached an accuracy of 100%, while SVM reached an accuracy of 98.11%. The second proposed system consists of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-18, based on the transfer learning method, in which deep feature maps were extracted and classified with high accuracy. All the models obtained promising results for the early detection of leukemia in both datasets, with an accuracy of 100% for the AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-18 models.

Recent NMR and FT-IR experimental studies suggest that methoxylated zeolites are able to produce hydrocarbons by a mechanism involving carbene migration and association. In order to understand these observations, we have performed QM/MM computational investigations on a range of reaction mechanisms for the reaction of zeolite bound methoxy and carbene groups, which are proposed to initiate hydrocarbon formation in the MTH process. Our simulations demonstrate that it is kinetically unfavourable for methyl species to form on the framework away from the zeolite acid site, and both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavourable for methyl groups to migrate through the framework and aggregate around an acid site. Formation of carbene moieties was considered as an alternative pathway to the formation of C-C bonds; however, the reaction energy for conversion of a methyl to a carbene is unfavourable. Metadynamics simulations help confirm further that methyl species at the framework acid sites would be more reactive towards formed C2+ species, rather than inter-framework migration, and that the role of carbenes in the formation of the first C-C bond will be via a concerted type of mechanism rather than stepwise.","output":"QM/MM study of the reactivity of zeolite bound methoxy and carbene groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Licha black pig, a popular indigenous Chinese pig breed, is known for its multi-vertebral trait and higher lean meat rate.

Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19. Results The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p<0.0001).

Pneumocystis jirovecii is the predominant fungus reported, constituting ~25% of the fungi detected. In ~12.5% of the cases, more than one fungus was detected by NGS.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Centre clients (n = 10, in-person and telephone) and staff (n = 5, telephone), and external professionals (n = 5, telephone), during April-August 2020. These were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed using Framework. Service documents were used to enhance contextual understanding. Analysis was informed by theories of psychologically informed environments and enabling environments. RESULTS: The start of the pandemic was a time of confusion, disruption, and isolation. Centre staff rapidly adapted methods of engagement to provide a range of comprehensive physical and emotional supports, to both existing and new clients, through telephone and online communication and, eventually, socially distanced in-person support. This involved balancing the risks of COVID-19 infection/transmission with the benefits of continuity of support to those highly vulnerable to a range of harms. Whilst the pandemic created many challenges, it also facilitated removal of barriers, particularly concerning provision of harm reduction services which had previously been severely constrained. Clients described the Centre as a 'lifeline', providing stability and safety during a period of profound disruption when other services closed their doors. Strong leadership, intensive team working, support/training for staff, a focus on relationships, and active use of client feedback, enabled responsive adaptation to fast-changing demands and the creation of a 'culture of care'. CONCLUSION: This study provides a unique insight into the pandemic by analysing the response of one homeless service during the height of the pandemic. We present a range of implications that have international relevance for those designing policies, and adapting front-line services, to proactively respond to COVID-19 and the continued public health crises of homelessness and drug-related deaths.","output":"'They already operated like it was a crisis, because it always has been a crisis': a qualitative exploration of the response of one homeless service in Scotland to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triage and rationing of scarce intensive care unit (ICU) resources are an unavoidable necessity. In routine circumstances, ICU triage is premised on the best interests of an individual patient; however, when increased demand exceeds capacity, as during an infectious disease outbreak, healthcare providers need to make difficult decisions to benefit the broader community while still respecting individual interests. We are currently living through an unprecedented period, with South Africa (SA) facing the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) expedited the development of a triage guidance document to inform the appropriate and fair use of scarce ICU resources during this pandemic. Triage decision-making is based on the clinical odds of a positive ICU outcome, balanced against the risk of mortality and longer-term morbidity affecting quality of life. Factors such as age and comorbid conditions are considered for their potential impact on clinical outcome, but are never the sole criteria for denying ICU-level care. Arbitrary, unfair discrimination is never condoned. The CCSSA COVID-19 triage guideline is aligned with SA law and international ethical standards, and upholds respect for all persons. The Bill of Rights, however, does not mandate the level of care enshrined in the constitutional right to healthcare. ICU admission is not always appropriate, available or feasible for every person suffering critical illness or injury; however, everyone has the right to receive appropriate healthcare at another level. If ICU resources are used for people who do not stand to benefit, this effectively denies others access to potentially life-saving healthcare. Appropriate triaging can therefore be considered a constitutional imperative.","output":"Critical care triage during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa: A constitutional imperative!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread worldwide and become a pandemic. We report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cluster infections. METHODS: Data of clustered cases were retrieved from the public health emergency monitoring information system of China. We analyzed the incubation period, generation gap, secondary attack rate, and viral load in various grouped cases. RESULTS: A total of 60 COVID-19 infection clusters including 226 patients and 19 asymptomatic cases involving four generations were analyzed. With the increase of transmission generations, secondary attack rate decreased (P0.001) and severity alleviated (P = 0.008). The median incubation period and intergenerational interval were 9 and 6 days, respectively. The secondary attack rate was 7.1% in the index cases, 5.0% in the first generation, 1.0% in the second generation, and 4.7% overall. Severe cases were seen more in the index (13, 65%) and first generation (7, 35%) ones, who had a significantly higher viral load than the mild and moderate ones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase of transmission generation, secondary infection rate and severity decreased. Severe patients had a higher virus load.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) might be advantageous in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term oncologic and operative outcomes of salvage surgery after TEM, comparing TaTME to conventional salavge TME (sTME). METHODS Consecutive patients treated with salvage surgery after TEM were identified. Patients who underwent TaTME were compared to those who had conventional sTME. The primary outcome was the ability to perform an appropriate oncologic procedure defined by a composite outcome (negative distal margins, negative radial margins and complete or near complete mesorectum specimen). RESULTS During the study period, 41 patients had salvage surgery after TEM. Of those, 11 patients had TaTME while 30 patients had sTME. All patients in the TaTME group met the composite outcome of appropriate oncologic procedure compared to 76.7% for the conventional sTME group (p = 0.19). TaTME was associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter preservation (100 vs. 50%, p = 0.01), higher rates of laparoscopic surgery (100 vs. 23.3%, p < 0.001) and lower rates of conversion to open surgery (9.1 vs. 57%, p < 0.001). No difference was found in postoperative morbidity (36.3 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that for patients requiring salvage surgery after TEM, TaTME is associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter-sparing surgery when compared to conventional transabdominal TME while producing adequate short-term oncologic outcomes. Salvage surgery after TEM might be a clear indication for TaTME rather than conventional surgery.","output":"Salvage TME following TEM: a possible indication for TaTME."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, mRNA-based therapeutics have been greatly boosted since the development of novel technologies of both mRNA synthesis and delivery system.

Google trends (GT) is a popular infodemiology source widely used in previous reports to study the correlation between internet relative search volume (RSV) and surges in various pathologies. This study aims to explore the association between GT and Covid-19 symptoms and to access the possibility of predicting new surges from internet searches. METHODS: Individual data was extracted from GT RSV on four main Covid-19 related symptoms in the Health category (fever, headache, cough and shortness of breath) in Portugal between 2020/03/02 and 2021/02/15, corresponding to each of the identified surges of daily new cases (DNC) in Portugal, retrieved from GitHub. Pearson's-correlation coefficient was used for assessment. Additionally, a 14 days time-lag correlation analysis between data for the same period of time was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations were found between fever' web searches and the DNC in the first (p = 0.02) and third (p = 0.02) wave. No statistically significant correlations were found between any other variables. Through time lag analysis, we found a maximum Pearson association between web searches for cough' and the DNC during the first wave at 14 days (r = 0.55), as well as during the third wave, with a maximum association at 3 days time lag (r = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring behaviour and public interest in health related issues, such as crisis, is necessary and may help in the establishment of better and target oriented health policies. Despite previously stated potential, constraints such as the exclusion of social media platforms or internet users' representativeness, could partly explain our limited results for portuguese predictability of new COVID-19 surges.

Although some vaccines and therapeutic drugs are currently in clinical trials, none of them are approved for commercial use yet. As with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell entry receptor to enter into the host cell. In this study, we have transiently produced human ACE2 fused with the Fc region of human IgG1 in Nicotiana benthamiana and the in vitro neutralization efficacy of the plant-produced ACE2-Fc fusion protein was assessed. The recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion protein was expressed in N. benthamiana at 100 g/g leaf fresh weight on day 6 post-infiltration. The recombinant fusion protein showed potent binding to receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the plant-produced fusion protein exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. Treatment with ACE2-Fc fusion protein after viral infection dramatically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells with an IC(50) value of 0.84 g/ml.

With the differences in health care systems and lockdown policies in various regions, the pandemic's effect on organ donation and transplant service may vary. Most of the deceased donor organ referrals in our hospital came from non-intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study is to report our experience and quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on deceased donor organ donation in our center. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study comparing the deceased donor organ donation activity during the period January 23 to November 30, 2020 with the same period in 2018 in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS There was a 26.9% reduction in deceased donor organ donor referral in 2020 compared with 2018. No significant difference in the proportion of referrals from ICU or non-ICU areas between the 2 time periods was observed. The brain death confirmation rate was significantly higher in 2020 (40.8% vs 20.2%, P = .003). Nine patients had family consent for organ donation in 2020 (vs 7 patients in the same period in 2018).

As a result, they may not be completely aware of the danger/risk involved, which could impact their ability to control the spread of the virus. This systematic review aims to enhance HWs' knowledge and their perception of the spread risk of COVID-19 during the pandemic. A search was conducted in four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) to locate peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2020 and April 2020. Eventually, nine articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were, therefore, included in the present study. Six of the aforementioned studies specifically investigated HWs' perception of risk. Apart from a study that indicated medium perception (min = 56.5%), all other studies found high levels of risk perception (n = 5, max 92.1%). As for HWs' knowledge, apart from two studies that indicated medium percentage levels (min = 56.5%), the rest of the studies report high percentages (n = 7, max = 93.2%). Two of the studies, which assessed the sources of information that HWs use, agree that social media is the most widely used source of information. The findings of this study suggest that HWs had a satisfactory perception of risk during the spread of COVID-19. Although fields with medium knowledge levels were identified, HWs' overall knowledge may also be described as satisfactory.

The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","output":"Venous thrombosis epidemiology, pathophysiology, and anticoagulant therapies and trials in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients in Spain with imported arbovirus infections, we analyzed 22,655 records from a collaborative network for January 2009-December 2018.

Methods We first sought to estimate the vertical transmission rate of congenital CMV infection in twins by gathering cohort-based studies of congenital CMV in which vertical transmission in both singleton and twin pregnancies was reported. This also allowed us to compare singleton and twin infection rates. From the above studies and other large cohorts of congenitally infected infants, the percentage of discordantly infected twin pairs determined whether this is a rare phenomenon. Theorizing discordance is not rare, we then analyzed data from cases with twin outcomes for congenital CMV infection, according to whether the twins were monozygotic or dizygotic, and calculated their corresponding concordance rates to estimate the broad-sense heritability. Lastly, we described other factors that might affect vertical transmission. Results From five articles following at-risk pregnancies, the rate of vertical transmission in twin pregnancies is 58.7% (95% CI 43.3-72.3%) whereas in singleton pregnancies it is 31.4% (95% CI: 29.0-34.0%) p = 0.0002. Of ten studies of larger cohorts of infants with congenital CMV infection, 21 of 42 twin pairs with at least one twin infected were discordant for congenital CMV (50.0%, 95% CI: 34.4-65.6%) indicating discordance of congenital CMV infection in twin pairs is not rare. Of 28 studies covering 37 twin pairs where at least one twin had congenital CMV, and zygosity was known, eleven of thirteen monozygotic twin pairs (84.6%; 95% CI: 53.7-97.3%) were concordant for CMV infection, and nine of twenty-four dizygotic twin pairs (37.5%; 95% CI: 19.6-59.2%) were concordant for infection giving an estimated hereditability of 94.2%. Within these 37 twin pairs, factors such as primary or recurrent maternal infection, prematurity, growth discordance, and sex are described; however, in many of these cases these factors are unknown. Conclusion The rate of vertical transmission of congenital CMV is higher for twins than singletons. Discordance of congenital CMV in twins is not rare and suggests a possible genetic susceptibility to congenital CMV.","output":"Vertical Transmission and Discordance of Cytomegalovirus in Twin Pregnancies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We empirically analyze the impact of economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the trading volume of each sector in the S&P 500 index.

This has left gaps in the literature regarding relationships between strength and long-term health outcomes. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and validity of a video-led, self-administered 30-second sit-to-stand (STS) test in a sub-cohort of the U.S.-based Cancer Prevention Study-3. METHODS: A video was created to guide participants through the STS test. Participants submitted self-reported scores (n = 1851), and optional video recordings of tests (n = 134). Two reviewers scored all video tests. Means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for self-reported and video-observed scores. Mean differences (95% confidence intervals (CI)) and Spearman correlation coefficients between self-reported and observed scores were calculated, stratifying by demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Participants who uploaded a video reported 14.1 (SD = 3.5) stands, which was not significantly different from the number of stands achieved by the full cohort (13.9 (SD = 4.2), P-difference = 0.39). Self-reported and video-observed scores were highly correlated ( = 0.97, mean difference = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1C0.5). There were no significant differences in correlations by sociodemographic factors (all P-differences 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the self-administered, video-guided STS test may be appropriate for participants of varying ages, body sizes, and activity levels, and is feasible for implementation within large, longitudinal studies. This video-guided test would also be useful for remote adaptation of the STS test during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A method for remotely measuring physical function in large epidemiologic cohorts: Feasibility and validity of a video-guided sit-to-stand test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonoses, diseases that jump from animals to humans, are a growing health problem around the world.

Broad-spectrum and rapid anti-virus methods feasible for regular epidemic prevention against COVID-19 or alike are urgently called for. Methods: Using SARS-CoV-2 virus and bioengineered pseudoviruses carrying ACE2-binding spike protein domains, we examined the efficacy of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on virus entry prevention. Results: We found that CAP could effectively inhibit the entry of virus into cells. Direct CAP or CAP-activated medium (PAM) triggered rapid internalization and nuclear translocation of the virus receptor, ACE2, which began to return after 5 hours and was fully recovered by 12 hours. This was seen in vitro with both VERO-E6 cells and human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells, and in vivo. Hydroxyl radical (OH) and species derived from its interactions with other species were found to be the most effective CAP components for triggering ACE2 nucleus translocation. The ER/STAT3(Tyr705) and EGFR(Tyr1068/1086)/STAT3(Tyr705) axes were found to interact and collectively mediate the effects on ACE2 localization and expression.

Since simultaneously enhancing the activity and selectivity of lipopeptides is a seemingly unsolvable problem for conventional chemistry and pharmaceutical approaches, we present a biomimetic strategy to construct lipopeptide-based mimics of viral architectures and infections to enhance their antimicrobial efficacy while avoiding side effects. Herein, a surface-nanoengineered antimicrobial liposome (SNAL) is developed with the morphological features of enveloped viruses, including a moderate size range, lipid-based membrane structure, and highly lipopeptide-enriched bilayer surface. The SNAL possesses virus-like infection to bacterial cells, which can mediate high-efficiency and high-selectivity bacteria binding, rapidly attack and invade bacteria via plasma membrane fusion pathway, and induce a local burst release of lipopeptide to produce irreversible damage of cell membrane. Remarkably, viral mimics are effective against multiple pathogens with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (1.6C6.3 g mL(?1)), high bactericidal efficiency of >99% within 2 h, >10-fold enhanced selectivity over free lipopeptide, 99.8% reduction in skin MRSA load after a single treatment, and negligible toxicity.

This study investigated the extent of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir over 5 years, including during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, and the impact of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir on influenza virus oseltamivir susceptibility, personal stockpiling and influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS: Randomly selected community pharmacies in NZ reported oseltamivir provision by prescription and through pharmacist supply from 1 January 2007 to 15 September 2011. Oseltamivir resistance data on influenza viruses isolated during influenza surveillance from 2008 to 2011 were obtained, along with influenza vaccine uptake data from 2005 to 2011 and influenza detection data. RESULTS: Seventy of 85 eligible pharmacies completed the study (82% response rate). Most supplies of oseltamivir throughout the 5 years were dispensed against a prescription rather than pharmacist supplied, with pharmacist supply responsible for 11% of supplies during the pandemic years (2009C10) versus 27% and 31% during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Pharmacist-supplied oseltamivir did not appear to be associated with the development of resistance, with identified likely stockpiling or with a decline in influenza immunization. Pharmacist supplies largely matched the timing of influenza in the community and peaked in June 2009, as did prescription supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir in NZ has resulted in no significant change in the development of resistance or rates of influenza immunization. Supplies remained modest and significant consumer stockpiling through pharmacist supply has not occurred, even during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009 and 2010.

However, there is limited information about the effects of COVID-19 on chronic airway diseases. Therefore, we conducted the present study to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ascertain risk factors for acute exacerbations (AEs). Methods: This single-center observational study was conducted at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, involving asthma or COPD patients who had been treated with inhaled combination corticosteroids (ICSs), such as budesonide, and one long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA), such as formoterol, for at least a year before the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted telephone interviews to collect demographic information and clinical data between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, focusing on respiratory and systemic symptoms, as well as times of exacerbations. Data for asthma and COPD were then compared, and the risk factors for AEs were identified using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 251 patients were enrolled, comprising 162 (64.5%) who had asthma and 89 who had COPD, with none having COPD/asthma overlap. Frequency of AEs among asthma patients was significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019 (0.82  3.33 vs. 1.00  3.16; P < 0.05). Moreover, these patients visited the clinic less (0.37  0.93 vs. 0.49  0.94; P < 0.05) and used emergency drugs less (0.01  0.11 vs. 007  0.38; P < 0.05) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, among COPD patients, there were no significant differences in AE frequency, clinic visits, or emergency drug use. Furthermore, asthma patients visited clinics less frequently during the pandemic than those with COPD. Logistic regression analysis also showed that a history of at least one AE within the last 12 months was associated with increased AE odds for both asthma and COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic (odds ratio: 13.73, 95% CI: 7.04C26.77; P < 0.01). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with asthma showed better disease control than before, whereas patients with COPD may not have benefited from the pandemic. For both diseases, at least one AE within the previous 12 months was a risk factor for AEs during the pandemic. Particularly, among asthma patients, the risk factors for AE during the COVID-19 pandemic were urban environment, smoking, and lower asthma control test scores.","output":"Asthma Patients Benefit More Than Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.

We here aimed to investigate the success rates in performing ultrasound (US) guided central venous catheter insertion (CVC) in neonates and small infants undergoing cardiac surgery, and to evaluate the practicability and feasibility of thereby using a novel wireless US transducer (WUST). METHODS: Thirty neonates and small infants with a maximum body weight of 10 kg and need for CVC before cardiac surgery were included in this observational trial and were subdivided into two groups according to their weight: < 5 kg and  5 kg. Cannulation success, failure rate, essential procedure related time periods, and complications were recorded and the clinical utility of the WUST was assessed by a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: In total, CVC-insertion was successful in 27 (90%) of the patients and the first attempt was successful in 24 (78%) of patients. Success rates of CVC were 80% < 5 kg and 100% 5 kg. Comparing the two groups we found a clear trend towards longer needle insertion time in patients weighing < 5 kg (33 [28C69] vs. 24 [15C37]s, P = .07), whereas, the total time for catheter insertion and the duration of the whole procedure were similar in both groups (199 [167C228] vs. 178 [138C234] and 720[538C818] vs. 660 [562C833]s.

While socioeconomic background has been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic variation underlying this phenomenon. This study is aimed at examining the genetic basis behind the great discrepancies among diverse ethnic groups in terms of COVID-19 susceptibility for viral infection, disease prognosis, and mortality. To this end, in silico analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory sequences of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-the virus's gateway to host cells-and their plausible implications on expression levels was conducted. We provide indication that the variation in the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulatory sequences is likely to be involved in and contribute to this phenomenon. SNPs that are abundant in the more susceptible populations introduce binding sites (BSs) for transcription factors or they may invalidate BSs for transcription repressor-both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues. SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels. This aspect, when added to the socioeconomic factors, can be a cause for the divergent prevalence of the disease and the different mortality rates within diverse populations.

Particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution of large droplets to infection risk is dominant for distances < 0.6 m, whereas for longer distances, the exposure risk depends only on airborne droplets. In particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1%;for exposures of 1 and 15 min this distance increases to about 1.0 and 1.5 m, respectively.

All stages were conducted by at least two independent reviewers. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017075808). A total of 11,896 publications were identified, and 28 publications were included. Of these, 17 were conducted in Europe. Six of the included publications were multi-centre studies, and 16 were randomized trials. Usual care was the comparator. Significant results on quality of medication use were reported as positive in eleven studies (n = 18; 61%) and negative in one (n = 18, 6%). Hospital visits were reduced significantly in seven studies (n = 16; 44%). Four studies (n = 12; 33%) reported a positive significant effect on either length of stay or time to revisit, and one study reported a negative effect (n = 12; 6%). All studies investigating mortality (n = 6), patient-reported outcome (n = 7) and cost-effectiveness (n = 1) showed no significant results. This MiniReview indicates that multifaceted pharmacist-led interventions in a hospital setting may improve the quality of medication use and reduce hospital visits and length of stay, while no effect was seen on mortality, patient-reported outcome and cost-effectiveness.","output":"Multifaceted Pharmacist-led Interventions in the Hospital Setting: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: An internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) offers a way to increase access to evidence-based tinnitus care. To increase the accessibility of this intervention, the materials were translated into Spanish to reach Spanish as well as English speakers. A clinical trial indicated favorable outcomes of ICBT for tinnitus for the population of the United States. In view of later dissemination, a way to increase the applicability of this intervention is required. Such understanding is best obtained by considering the perspectives and experiences of participants of an intervention. This study aimed to identify the processes that could facilitate or hinder the clinical implementation of ICBT in the United States. Methods: This study evaluated the processes regarding enrolment, allocation, intervention delivery, the outcomes obtained, and the trial implementation. The study sample consisted of 158 participants who were randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. Results: Although the recruitment was sufficient for English speakers, recruiting the Spanish participants and participants belonging to ethnic minority groups was difficult despite using a wide range of recruitment strategies. The allocation processes were effective in successfully randomizing the groups. The intervention was delivered as planned, but not all the participants chose to engage with the materials provided. Compliance for completing the outcome measures was low. The personal and intervention factors were identified as barriers for the implementation whereas the facilitators included the support received, being empowering, the accessibility of the intervention, and its structure. Conclusion: An understanding regarding the factors contributing to the outcomes obtained, the barriers and facilitators of the results, engagement, and compliance were obtained. These insights will be helpful in preparing for the future dissemination of such interventions. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04004260.

As we consider clearance of athletes to participate in sports during the COVID-19 pandemic, we offer a brief review of the myocardial effects of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) through the lens of what is known about myocarditis and exercise. All athletes should be queried about any recent illness suspicious for COVID-19 prior to sports participation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was evaluated through 2020, with the following keywords: myocarditis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cardiac, and athletes. Selected articles identified through the primary search, along with position statements from around the world, and the relevant references from those articles, were reviewed for pertinent clinical information regarding the identification, evaluation, risk stratification, and management of myocarditis in patients, including athletes, with and without SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. RESULTS: Since myocarditis can present with a variety of symptoms, and can be asymptomatic, the sports medicine physician needs to have a heightened awareness of athletes who may have had COVID-19 and be at risk for myocarditis and should have a low threshold to obtain further cardiovascular testing. Symptomatic athletes with SARS-CoV-2 may require cardiac evaluation including an electrocardiogram and possibly an echocardiogram. Athletes with cardiomyopathy may benefit from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the recovery phase and, rarely, endocardial biopsy. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. The currently reported rates of cardiac involvement of COVID-19 makes myocarditis a risk, and physicians who clear athletes for participation in sport as well as sideline personnel should be versed with the diagnosis, management, and clearance of athletes with suspected myocarditis. Given the potentially increased risk of arrhythmias, sideline personnel should practice their emergency action plans and be comfortable using an automated external defibrillator.","output":"Implications of SARS-CoV-2-Associated Myocarditis in the Medical Evaluation of Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article analyzes contracting challenges faced by Italian health care authorities and U.S. procurement officials in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, and it provides practitioner-derived lessons for improving procurement in times of disaster.

This is particularly true for adolescents living with chronic illnesses as studies have shown that these populations are at higher risk for developing mental health problems. There is vast recognition of the need for age and culturally appropriate interventions to promote mental well-being and prevent mental health problems. In stark contrast, there is a dearth of relevant measures of mental well-being for adolescents. Our proposed systematic review aims to identify measures of mental well-being and to assess content, psychometric properties and relevance to adolescent populations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The systematic review methodology will be guided by the seven steps proposed by Eggar, Davey and Smith. Documents will be sourced from electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, Educational Resource Information Center, Medical Literature Analysis Retrieval System Online, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature plus, PsyArticles, SocIndex and Sabinet). All documents will be exported to Mendeley and two reviewers will independently screen the titles, abstracts and full texts for inclusion. Any discrepancies will be resolved by a third party. We will include studies published in all languages from 2000 to 2020, that use an instrument(s) that measure mental well-being among adolescent populations. Studies reporting on clinically significant mental illnesses or disorders will be excluded. A descriptive meta-synthesis approach will be used to identify and describe the mental health instruments used among adolescent populations, and to report on the psychometric properties. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required. The results of this review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication as well as conference presentations.","output":"Adolescent mental wellness: a systematic review protocol of instruments measuring general mental health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timber industry generates large amounts of residues such as sawdust.

The hemicellulose removed was 87.11% (wtwt-1) after dilute acid treatment at 130 C, 4.5% (wtwt-1) of H2SO4 for 20 min at 120 rpm. Three temperatures were evaluated for recovering the lignin and the highest yield, 93.97% (wtwt-1), was achieved at 170 C, 10% (wtwt-1) of NaOH for 90 min at 120 rpm. Lignin was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetry. The resulting cellulose-rich fraction exhibited polymorphic transformation.

Waiting for the collective immunity by vaccination, mass-testing, and isolation of positive cases remain essential. The development of a diagnosis method requiring a simple and non-invasive sampling with a quick and low-cost approach is on demand. We hypothesized that the combination of saliva specimens with MALDI-TOF MS profiling analyses could be the winning duo. Before characterizing MS saliva signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, optimization and standardization of sample collection, preparation and storage up to MS analyses appeared compulsory. In this view, successive experiments were performed on saliva from healthy healthcare workers. Specimen sampling with a roll cotton of Salivette(?) devices appeared the most appropriate collection mode. Saliva protein precipitation with organic buffers did not improved MS spectra profiles compared to a direct loading of samples mixed with acetonitrile/formic acid buffer onto MS plate. The assessment of sample storage conditions and duration revealed that saliva should be stored on ice until MS analysis, which should occur on the day of sampling. Kinetic collection of saliva highlighted reproducibility of saliva MS profiles over four successive days and also at two-week intervals. The intra-individual stability of saliva MS profiles should be a key factor in the future investigation for biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the singularity of MS profiles between individuals will require the development of sophisticated bio-statistical analyses such as machine learning approaches.

Thus, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that are capable to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT) and X-ray data is of immediate priority. Such automatic systems are usually based on traditional machine learning or deep learning methods. Differently from most of existing studies, which used either CT scan or X-ray images in COVID-19-case classification, we present a simple but efficient deep learning feature fusion model, called UncertaintyFuseNet, which is able to classify accurately large datasets of both of these types of images. We argue that the uncertainty of the model's predictions should be taken into account in the learning process, even though most of existing studies have overlooked it. We quantify the prediction uncertainty in our feature fusion model using effective Ensemble MC Dropout (EMCD) technique. A comprehensive simulation study has been conducted to compare the results of our new model to the existing approaches, evaluating the performance of competing models in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy and ROC curves. The obtained results prove the efficiency of our model which provided the prediction accuracy of 99.08\\\\% and 96.35\\\\% for the considered CT scan and X-ray datasets, respectively.

This study sought to evaluate the impact of hypertension and the use of ACEI/ARB on clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 3,788 patients aged 30 years or older who were confirmed with COVID-19 with real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were identified from a claims-based cohort in Korea. The primary study outcome was severe clinical events, a composite of intensive care unit admission, need for ventilator care, and death. RESULTS: Patients with hypertension (n = 1,190, 31.4 %) were older and had higher prevalence of comorbidities than those without hypertension. The risk of the primary study outcome was significantly higher in the hypertension group, even after multivariable adjustment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.67;95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.69). Among 1,044 patients with hypertensive medical treatment, 782 (74.9 %) were on ACEI or ARB. The ACEI/ARB subgroup had a lower risk of severe clinical outcomes compared to the no ACEI/ARB group, but this did not remain significant after multivariable adjustment (aOR, 0.68;95 % CI, 0.41 to 1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hypertension had worse COVID-19 outcomes than those without hypertension, while the use of RAAS-blocking agents was not associated with increased risk of any adverse study outcomes.

This results in failed lung monocyte-derived interstitial macrophages (IM) niche expansion and unchecked neutrophilic inflammation. Administration of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) rescues the monocytopenia, alters the circulating classical monocyte phenotype in hypoxic endotoxin-driven ALI and enables lung IM population expansion, thus limiting lung injury in endotoxin- and virally-induced hypoxic ALI.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal here is to review recent efforts in the application of docking simulations to identify inhibitors of the Mpro using the program AutoDock4. METHOD: We searched PubMed to identify studies that applied AutoDock4 for docking against this protein target. We used the structures available for Mpro to analyze intermolecular interactions and reviewed the methods used to search for inhibitors. RESULTS: The application of docking against the structures available for the Mpro found ligands with an estimated inhibition in the nanomolar range. Such computational approaches focused on the crystal structures revealed potential inhibitors of Mpro that might exhibit pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, most of these studies lack the proper validation of the docking protocol. Also, they all ignored the potential use of machine learning to predict affinity. CONCLUSION: The combination of structural data with computational approaches opened the possibility to accelerate the search for drugs to treat COVID-19. Several studies used AutoDock4 to search for inhibitors of Mpro. Most of them did not employ a validated docking protocol, which lends support to critics of their computational methodology. Furthermore, one of these studies reported the binding of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to Mpro.

Clinically affected cattle had a profuse liquid diarrhoea and many were systemically ill. Haematological changes suggestive of infection were present in 38 of 49 of these cattle. At least 35 cattle died and characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 20 of 26 examined histologically. Y. pseudotuberculosis was sensitive to tetracyclines in vitro and this drug produced a rapid bacteriological cure. Yersiniosis occurred during the winter, spring and early summer. Challenge of adult cattle with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III did not result in intestinal colonisation or clinical disease. Intestinal infection was, however, established in 4 weaned calves and haematological changes and antibody production were demonstrated in them. Intestinal microabscesses were seen in three calves killed on days 8, 14 and 18 after challenge. The fourth calf eliminated infection by day 18 and no lesions were demonstrated when it was killed on day 72.

SETTING University hospital PATIENTS Fifteen patients with an extirpated uterine weight of more than 500 g were enrolled from May 2008 to September 2009. INTERVENTIONS SPA-LAVH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There were 11 cases with uterine myomas and 4 cases of adenomyosis. All patients had symptoms related to these diagnoses including menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pressure symptoms such as urinary frequency. The median and range are used to describe data not distributed normally. The median operation time, weight of the uterus, and estimated blood loss were 125 minutes (80 to 236 minutes), 690 g (503 to 1260 g), and 500 mL (150 to 1000 mL), respectively. There was a significant linear correlation between the operation time and the extirpated uterine weight (p<.002). Thirteen procedures were successfully performed with SPA-LAVH.

We develop models to predict the number of PPP loans awarded to Veteran-owned, finding that the inclusion of local VA medical center characteristics adds almost as much explanatory power as the industry and occupational composition in an area and even more than the education, race, and age distribution combined. Our results suggest that VA medical centers can play an important role in helping Veterans thrive even beyond addressing their direct medical needs.","output":"Using Machine Learning to Understand Veterans' Receipt of Loans in the Paycheck Protection Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmania donovani is the major cause of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), now recognized as the parasitic disease with the highest level of mortality second only to malaria. No human vaccine is currently available. A 36 kDa L. donovani nucleoside hydrolase (LdNH36) surface protein has been previously identified as a potential vaccine candidate antigen. Here we present data on the expression of LdNH36 in Pichia pastoris and its purification at the 20 L scale to establish suitability for future pilot scale manufacturing. To improve efficiency of process development and ensure reproducibility, 4 N-linked glycosylation sites shown to contribute to heterogeneous high-mannose glycosylation were mutated to glutamine residues. The mutant LdNH36 (LdNH36-dg2) was expressed and purified to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography and light scattering demonstrated that LdNH36-dg2 existed as a tetramer in solution, similar to the wild-type recombinant L. major nucleoside hydrolase. The amino acid mutations do not affect the tetrameric interface as confirmed by theoretical modeling, and the mutated amino acids are located outside the major immunogenic domain. Immunogenic properties of the LdNH36-dg2 recombinant protein were evaluated in BALB/c mice using formulations that included a synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, together with a microparticle delivery platform (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)). Mice exhibited high levels of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies that were reactive to both LdNH36-dg2 and LdNH36 wild-type. While the point mutations did affect the hydrolase activity of the enzyme, the IgG antibodies elicited by LdNH36-dg2 were shown to inhibit the hydrolase activity of the wild-type LdNH36. The results indicate that LdNH36-dg2 as expressed in and purified from P. pastoris is suitable for further scale-up, manufacturing, and testing in support of future first-in-humans phase 1 clinical trials.","output":"Expression and purification of an engineered, yeast-expressed Leishmania donovani nucleoside hydrolase with immunogenic properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an RNA virus-based disease that can be deadly. For critically ill patients, mechanical ventilation is an important life-saving treatment. However, mechanical ventilation shows a trade-off between supporting respiratory function and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Surfactant therapy is a medical administration of exogenous surfactant to supplement or replace deficient or dysfunctional endogenous surfactant. Surfactant therapy can be used to postpone or shorten the use of mechanical ventilation to minimize or avoid VILI, because surfactants can reduce surface tension, improve lung compliance, and enhance oxygenation. In addition, nanotechnology can be applied to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the adverse effects of surfactants.

METHODS: The clinical and epidemiological data of 702 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were collected from 19 European Hospitals. The following data were extracted: age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco consumption, comorbidities, general, and otolaryngological symptoms. Dysphonia and otolaryngological symptoms were self-assessed through a 4-point scale. The prevalence of dysphonia, as part of the COVID-19 symptoms, was assessed. The outcomes were compared between dysphonic and nondysphonic patients. The association between dysphonia severity and outcomes was studied through Bayesian analysis. RESULTS: A total of 188 patients were dysphonic, accounting for 26.8% of cases. Females developed more frequently dysphonia than males (P = 0.022). The proportion of smokers was significantly higher in the dysphonic group (P = 0.042). The prevalence of the following symptoms was higher in dysphonic patients compared with nondysphonic patients: cough, chest pain, sticky sputum, arthralgia, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The severity of dyspnea, dysphagia, ear pain, face pain, throat pain, and nasal obstruction was higher in dysphonic group compared with nondysphonic group. There were significant associations between the severity of dysphonia, dysphagia, and cough. CONCLUSION: Dysphonia may be encountered in a quarter of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and should be considered as a symptom list of the infection. Dysphonic COVID-19 patients are more symptomatic than nondysphonic individuals.

Due to this complexity, the relative contributions of the virus and host factors are best studied in vivo using animal models. In this review, we describe how the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been used as a powerful model to study host-virus interactions and inflammation by combining robust forward and reverse genetic tools with in vivo imaging of transparent embryos and larvae. The innate immune system has an essential role in the initial inflammatory response to viral infection. Focused studies of the innate immune response to viral infection are possible using the zebrafish model as there is a 4-6 week timeframe during development where they have a functional innate immune system dominated by neutrophils and macrophages. During this timeframe, zebrafish lack a functional adaptive immune system, so it is possible to study the innate immune response in isolation. Sequencing of the zebrafish genome has revealed significant genetic conservation with the human genome, and multiple studies have revealed both functional conservation of genes, including those critical to host cell infection and host cell inflammatory response. In addition to studying several fish viruses, zebrafish infection models have been developed for several human viruses, including influenza A, noroviruses, chikungunya, Zika, dengue, herpes simplex virus type 1, Sindbis, and hepatitis C virus. The development of these diverse viral infection models, coupled with the inherent strengths of the zebrafish model, particularly as it relates to our understanding of macrophage and neutrophil biology, offers opportunities for far more intensive studies aimed at understanding conserved host responses to viral infection.

In this paper, we make recommendations for organisational leaders based on past research on employee wellbeing in post-disaster context and on preliminary evidence from an ongoing study in the Covid-19 context. In the present study, we investigated what job resources employees found supportive during Aotearoa ;New Zealand's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and how these resources related to their hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing at that time. Employees (n = 75) took part in an online survey, which included both open-ended and quantitative measures on job resources and wellbeing. Qualitative findings suggest that providing a sense of job security, effective communications, flexibility and job control, recognition of extra efforts to accommodate changes, individualised support to continue working, and expressing concern for employees' health and wellbeing were salient job resources. The quantitative results largely supported these findings, although the strength of the relationships varied between the type of resources and the different conceptualisations of wellbeing.

To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020.

Differentially expressed circRNAs were obtained by R software. The expression levels of circRNA_0043691 in GC tissue and normal tissue were identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 was then constructed and verified by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, migration, and invasion capacity were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell migration, and invasion, respectively. Next, knockdown of miR-873-3p was constructed and co-cultured with circRNA_0043691 knockdown to identify whether knockdown of miR-873-3p could attenuate the circRNA_0043691 knockdown on GC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. The relationship between miR-873-3p and circRNA_0043691 or GART was predicted by bioinformatics tools and verified by dual-luciferase reporter. A total of 211 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 143 remarkably downregulated circRNAs and 68 significantly upregulated circRNAs. CircRNA_0043691 was upregulated in GC tissue. Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion in GC cells.

Based on association quotients derived from these simulations, we classified the SCRs as weak binders, promiscuous binders, or selective binders. The SCRs almost exclusively associate at the Man(3)GlcNAc(2) core, which is common to all N-glycans, but the binding affinity between the SCR? glycan pair depends on the noncovalent interactions between the heterocycle rings and the glycan antennae.

Objectives To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 may induce cellular senescence in lung epithelial cells, leading to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Methods Autopsy lung tissue samples from eleven COVID-19 patients and sixty age-matched non-infected controls were analysed by immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 and markers of cellular senescence (SenTraGor, p16INK4A) and key SASP cytokines (interleukin-1, interleukin-6). We also investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of an epithelial cell line induces senescence and cytokine secretion. Measurements and Main Results SARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy predominantly in alveolar type-2 (AT2) cells, which also expressed the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical entry receptor for this virus. In COVID-19 samples, AT2 cells displayed increased markers of senescence [p16INK4A, SenTraGor staining positivity in 121.2% of cells compared to 1.70.13% in non-infected controls (p<0.001)], with markedly increased expression of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 (p<0.001). Infection of epithelial cells (Vero E6) with SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro induced senescence and DNA damage (increased SenTraGor and -H2AX), and reduced proliferation (Ki67) compared to uninfected control cells (p<0.01). Conclusions We demonstrate that in severe COVID-19 patients, AT2 cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and show senescence and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells may induce senescence and inflammation, indicating that cellular senescence may be an important molecular mechanism of severe COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects lung epithelial cells and induces senescence and an inflammatory response in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to clarify the factors that affect effective group discussions when using online whiteboard during face-to-face design activities for high school students in the classroom during the pandemic.

Soil protease levels were high in the low PFOS treatment, but low in the high PFOS treatment. PFOS produced inverted U-shaped responses in the potential nitrification (1.5, 3.0, and 1.1 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), denitrification (0.19, 0.30, and 0.22 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), and N2O emission rates (0.01, 0.03, and 0.02 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively) of bulk soil. The abundance of the archaea amoA gene decreased with increasing PFOS concentration, whereas that of bacterial amoA increased; inverted U-shaped responses were observed for narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ. In the PFOS-contaminated rhizosphere soil, the observed changes differed from those in the bulk soil and differed between treatments. P. communis tended to upregulate each step of the nitrogen cycle under low PFOS conditions, whereas L. salicaria tended to inhibit them.

There are several cases of human and animal infection by Trichinella spp. in South America, but Brazil is considered free of the domestic cycle, even though there is unpublished serological evidence of Trichinella spp. in wild boars. This study investigates Trichinella spp. infection in wild boars and wild carnivores in Brazil by serological and artificial digestion tests. We tested 136 samples: 121 from wild boars and 15 from wild carnivores, the latter only by artificial digestion. No larvae were found in the artificial digestion tests, but 6.1% (95% CI 3.0C12.0) of the wild boars were positive in iELISA. These results suggest the occurrence of a Trichinella spp. wild cycle related to wild boars in Brazil, but further analyses should be performed to confirm the presence of the parasite. ABSTRACT: Trichinella is a zoonotic nematode traditionally detected worldwide in both domestic and wild animals. In South America, along with the occurrence of this parasite in domestic pigs and wild boars, there are reports of infection in wild carnivores. Brazil is considered free of the domestic cycle of Trichinella, but there is unpublished serological evidence of infection in wild boars, which changed the Brazilian status in OIE regarding the disease after an official communication. We investigated Trichinella spp. infection in wild boars and wild carnivores in the Southeastern region of Brazil. A total of 136 samples were tested, 121 from wild boars and 15 from wild carnivores. Artificial enzymatic digestion (AED) tests were performed on muscle samples from 37 wild boars and 15 wild carnivores, and 115 serum samples from wild boars were tested by iELISA. Seven serum samples from wild boars tested positive (7/115 = 6.1%, 95% CI 3.0C12.0), but no larvae were found in the AED. There was no significant difference between sex, age, and location of the samples. The serological results suggest that a wild cycle of Trichinella spp. may occur in Brazil, but further analyses should be performed to confirm the presence of the parasite.","output":"Seropositive Wild Boars Suggesting the Occurrence of a Wild Cycle of Trichinella spp. in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) remain disproportionately affected by HIV. In a rural area of South Africa with an annual incidence (2011-2015) of 5 and 7% per annum for 15-19 and 20-24-year olds respectively, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could provide AGYW with a form of HIV prevention they can more easily control. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we describe findings from a study conducted in 2017 that assessed knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP to better understand community readiness for an AGYW PrEP rollout. METHODS: We used descriptive analysis of a quantitative demographic survey (n = 8,414 ages 15-86) to identify population awareness and early PrEP adopters. We also conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 52 potential PrEP gatekeepers (health care workers, community leaders) to assess their potential influence in an AGYW PrEP rollout and describe the current sexual health landscape. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and iteratively coded to identify major themes. RESULTS: PrEP knowledge in the general population, measured through a demographic survey, was low (n = 125/8,414, 1.49% had heard of the drug). Medicalized delivery pathways created hostility to AGYW PrEP use. Key informants had higher levels of knowledge about PrEP and saw it as a needed intervention. Community norms around adolescent sexuality, which painted sexually active youth as irresponsible and disengaged from their own health, made many ambivalent towards a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Health care workers discussed ways to shame AGYW if they tried to access PrEP as they feared the drug would encourage promiscuity and \\"risky\\" behaviour. Others interviewed opposed provision on the basis of health care equity and feared PrEP would divert both drug and human resources from treatment programs. CONCLUSIONS: The health system in this poor, high-HIV incidence area had multiple barriers to a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Norms around adolescent sexuality and gatekeeper concerns that PrEP could divert health resources from treatment to prevention could create barriers to PrEP roll-out in this setting. Alternate modes of delivery, particularly those which are youth-led and demedicalize PrEP, must be explored.","output":"\\"They have this not care - don't care attitude:\\" A Mixed Methods Study Evaluating Community Readiness for Oral PrEP in Adolescent Girls and Young Women in a Rural Area of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 2019), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a dreadful infectious disease which has emerged as one of the most significant medical emergency affecting everyone directly or indirectly.

In this policy brief, we argue that the response to the coronavirus outbreak also offers an opportunity to advance the climate agenda. Indeed, given that we have scarce resources at our disposal, it is essential that we synergize such efforts. We propose that this can be accomplished in two primary ways: (1) harnessing the disruptive forces of the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the decline of carbon-intensive industries, technologies, and practices, and (2) leveraging responses to drive low-carbon innovation. From these two strategies, we outline five principles of sustainability transition policy to serve as a guide during these challenging times.","output":"A tale of two crises: COVID-19 and climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was detected in China in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Community pharmacists have an important role in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students' awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). RESULTS: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops. CONCLUSION: The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media. This fact rings bills considering the numerous conflicting messages publicized during the pandemic through the media.","output":"Pharmacists' readiness to deal with the coronavirus pandemic: Assessing awareness and perception of roles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant infections due to Mycobacterium abscessus often require complex and prolonged regimens for treatment. Here, we report the evaluation of a new ex vivo antimicrobial susceptibility testing model using organotypic cultures of murine precision-cut lung slices, an experimental model in which metabolic activity, and all the usual cell types of the organ are found while the tissue architecture and the interactions between the different cells are maintained. METHODS: Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from the lungs of wild type BALB/c mice using the Krumdieck(?) tissue slicer. Lung tissue slices were ex vivo infected with the virulent M. abscessus strain L948. Then, we tested the antimicrobial activity of two drugs: imipenem (4, 16 and 64 g/mL) and tigecycline (0.25, 1 and 4 g/mL), at 12, 24 and 48 h. Afterwards, CFUs were determined plating on blood agar to measure the surviving intracellular bacteria. The viability of PCLS was assessed by Alamar Blue assay and corroborated using histopathological analysis. RESULTS: PCLS were successfully infected with a virulent strain of M. abscessus as demonstrated by CFUs and detailed histopathological analysis. The time-course infection, including tissue damage, parallels in vivo findings reported in genetically modified murine models for M. abscessus infection. Tigecycline showed a bactericidal effect at 48 h that achieved a reduction of > 4log(10) CFU/mL against the intracellular mycobacteria, while imipenem showed a bacteriostatic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this new organotypic ex vivo model provides the opportunity to test new drugs against M. abscessus, decreasing the use of costly and tedious animal models.","output":"Ex vivo infection of murine precision-cut lung tissue slices with Mycobacterium abscessus: a model to study antimycobacterial agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Most patients who undergo an urgent referral for suspected lung cancer do not have lung cancer [1]. This can increase the workload of cancer services, which are already under considerable strain due to the COVID pandemic. This study aimed to identify factors which predict lung cancer in patients urgently referred for suspected lung cancer. Methods: All urgent lung cancer referrals to Watford General Hospital between January 2020-January 2021 were screened. Patient data was retrospectively collected from hospital and primary care records. Patients were organised into two groups: Lung Cancer (patients with a radiological and/or pathological diagnosis of lung cancer) and Not Lung Cancer (patients in whom a diagnosis of lung cancer was excluded by a multi-disciplinary team). Red flag symptoms were defined as per the NICE guidelines for lung cancer referral. Results: 115/656 (17.5%) of patients urgently referred for suspected lung cancer were diagnosed with lung cancer;an additional 12 patients were diagnosed with other cancers. 100 patients with lung cancer and 100 patients without lung cancer were randomly selected. More lung cancer patients displayed B symptoms than patients without lung cancer (Table 1). Lung cancer patients presented with a greater total of red flag symptoms (2.81 vs 1.11;P<0.00001) and accumulated more smoking pack-years (36.1 vs 18.9;P<0.00001). 33% of patients without lung cancer were diagnosed with an airway disease.

In a mixed method design employing an embedded approach with a quasi-experimental design, we have examined the use of CBM during a 5-week Gynaecology and Obstetrics course. The study was conducted as a non-mandatory revision exam with two additional questionnaires on Moodle. Majority of students perceive CBM as fair (78%) and useful (94%). Most students would immediately want CBM to be used for revision exams, but more practice would be needed for CBM to be used in graded exams. The lowest self-evaluation of knowledge was mostly seen by worst (less than 70% Accuracy) and best achievers (more than 90% Accuracy);the worst achievers probably have knowledge gaps, and the best achievers probably correctly guessed at least one question. Our findings conclude that CBM does not discriminate any learner type (p = 0.932) and does not change the general distribution of the exam scores, since there is no significant differences between Certainty-Based Score (M = 80.4%, SD = 10.4%) and Accuracy (M = 79.8%, SD = 11.1%);t(176) = 0.8327, p = 0.4061.

A secondary objective was to explore changes in PrEP use and the need for PrEP follow-up. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey. The questionnaire was available in Dutch, French and English, between April 10 and 27 (2020), and disseminated via sexual health and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or intersex organisations throughout Belgium. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, not being exclusively heterosexual and living or being born in Belgium. RESULTS: The sample included 694 MSM. Physical sex with non-steady partners decreased from 59.1% to 8.9% during the first weeks of the lockdown. Those who had sex with non-steady partners were significantly more likely to be HIV positive, to use PrEP or to have engaged in sexual practices such as group sex, chemsex and sex work before the lockdown, compared with their counterparts. Among those who used PrEP before the lockdown, 47.0% stopped using PrEP, 19.7% used event-driven PrEP and 33.3% used daily PrEP during the lockdown. Almost two-thirds of PrEP users had a PrEP care appointment in the weeks before the lockdown and a minority received follow-up elsewhere or online. Some PrEP users had concerns regarding their follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MSM in our survey substantially reduced sexual contact with non-steady partners during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting that the risk for HIV and STI transmission in this period was low.

The advisory process is, in the ideal situation, a collective duty of science and politics. The final decision rests ultimately with politicians. An understanding of the differences between science and politics is necessary for successfully providing advice to politicians. The requirements necessary to allow politics to substantially follow the advice of scientists are multifarious. The first of these is trust from the side of politics and the public and from the side of science competitive research, respect and communication skills, neutrality and integrity. From these requireberatung ments it is possible to derive criteria for quality assurance in advice to politics.

Thus, the main objectives of this study was (1) to evaluate the association between phubbing and temperaments, and (2) assess the mediating effect of self-esteem and emotional intelligence in the association between phubbing and temperaments among a sample of Lebanese adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, carried out between August and September 2020, enrolled 461 participants aged between 18 and 29 years old. Participants were recruited from all districts/governorates of Lebanon (Beirut, Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon, South Lebanon, and Bekaa) using the snowball technique.

This study explored the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies and sleep in the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As detailed in this studys pre-registration (osf.io/k9qtw), a cross-sectional research design was used to investigate the impact of mindfulness on mental health and the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, rumination and suppression) and insomnia. A total of 493 participants from the general population answered an online survey and were included in the final analysis. The online survey consisted of the short form of the Five-Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-SF), the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the short form of the Rumination Response Scale (RSS-SF), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). RESULTS: Structural equation modelling revealed that mindfulness was related to lower symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, both directly and indirectly. Mindfulness was negatively associated with rumination and insomnia. As hypothesised, models revealed that the associations between mindfulness and depression, anxiety and psychological distress were significantly mediated by its negative associations with rumination and insomnia. Our findings also demonstrated that rumination was related to increased insomnia symptoms, which in turn was associated with increased mental health problems, indicating a mediated mediation. Mindfulness was also positively associated with cognitive reappraisal and negatively associated with suppression, which were, respectively, negatively and positively associated with depressive symptoms, and thus functioned as specific mediators of the association between mindfulness and depression. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rumination and insomnia operate transdiagnostically as interrelated mediators of the effects of mindfulness on mental health, whereas cognitive reappraisal and suppression function as specific mediators for depression. These insights emphasise the importance of targeting emotion regulation and sleep in mindfulness interventions for improving mental health. Limitations and implications for practice are discussed.","output":"Mindfulness as a Protective Factor Against Depression, Anxiety and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Emotion Regulation and Insomnia Symptoms as Mediators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biosensors have witnessed an escalating interest nowadays, both in the research and commercial fields.

The team met weekly, received education, and provided visits and guidance in pairs to socially disengaged residents (mentees). The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger study. Method: We conducted a mixed-methods pre-post study to evaluate the program. We collected feasibility data associated with the program implementation, including assessment of the sample and ability to recruit; procedures for data collection; retention, program adherence and acceptability; and residents' responses including loneliness, depression, purpose in life, social identity and sense of belonging outcomes. We enrolled community mentors (n = 65), resident mentors (n = 48) staff facilitators (n = 24) and mentees (n = 74) in 10 Canadian sites. Results: Most feasibility objectives were met, and adherence and acceptability were high. Some resource challenges and low retention rates among resident mentors were noted. We found a 29% reduction in depression scores (p = .048; d = .30) and 15% reduction in loneliness scores (p = .014; d = .23). Purpose in life, social identity and sense of belonging were unchanged. Interviews among participants indicated high acceptability and positive perceptions of the program. Conclusion: The study findings reveal a potential role for mentorship as a viable approach to reducing loneliness and depression in long-term care settings and lay the groundwork for future research.","output":"'It makes life worthwhile!'

We examined the association between time to colonoscopy and CRC outcomes among individuals who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy after abnormal stool-based screening. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of veterans age 50 to 75 years with an abnormal fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) between 1999 and 2010. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards to generate CRC-specific incidence and mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 3-month colonoscopy intervals, with 1 to 3 months as the reference group. Association of time to colonoscopy with late-stage CRC diagnosis was also examined. RESULTS Our cohort included 204,733 patients. Mean age was 61 years (SD 6.9). Compared with patients who received a colonoscopy at 1 to 3 months, there was an increased CRC risk for patients who received a colonoscopy at 13 to 15 months (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.00-1.27), 16 to 18 months (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.10-1.43), 19 to 21 months (HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.11-1.48), and 22 to 24 months (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.07-1.47). Compared with patients who received a colonoscopy at 1 to 3 months, mortality risk was higher in groups who received a colonoscopy at 19 to 21 months (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.51-1.99) and 22 to 44 months (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.03-1.88). Odds for late-stage CRC increased at 16 months. CONCLUSIONS Increased time to colonoscopy is associated with higher risk of CRC incidence, death, and late-stage CRC after abnormal FIT/FOBT. Interventions to improve CRC outcomes should emphasize diagnostic follow-up within 1 year of an abnormal FIT/FOBT result.","output":"Time to Colonoscopy After Abnormal Stool-Based Screening and Risk for Colorectal Cancer Incidence and Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The timing and magnitude of the immune response (i.e., the immunodynamics) associated with the early innate immune response to viral infection display distinct trends across influenza A virus subtypes in vivo. Evidence shows that the timing of the type-I interferon response and the overall magnitude of immune cell infiltration are both correlated with more severe outcomes. However, the mechanisms driving the distinct immunodynamics between infections of different virus strains (strain-specific immunodynamics) remain unclear. Here, computational modeling and strain-specific immunologic data are used to identify the immune interactions that differ in mice infected with low-pathogenic H1N1 or high-pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses. Computational exploration of free parameters between strains suggests that the production rate of interferon is the major driver of strain-specific immune responses observed in vivo, and points towards the relationship between the viral load and lung epithelial interferon production as the main source of variance between infection outcomes. A greater understanding of the contributors to strain-specific immunodynamics can be utilized in future efforts aimed at treatment development to improve clinical outcomes of high-pathogenic viral strains.","output":"Mathematical Modeling Finds Disparate Interferon Production Rates Drive Strain-Specific Immunodynamics during Deadly Influenza Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En la ltima semana, se notificaron casi 1,5 millones de casos y 19 000 muertes por COVID-19 en la Regin de las Amricas Desde el inicio de la pandemia, el virus de la COVID-19 ha infectado a ms de 23 millones de personas en nuestra Regin y ha causado la muerte a ms de 680 000 En los actuales momentos, Amrica del Norte sigue representando una gran proporcin de las cifras de nuevas infecciones En Estados Unidos an se observa una aceleracin en el nmero de casos: tan solo en la ltima semana se notificaron ms de un milln de infecciones nuevas en ese pas Estos repuntes han dado lugar a un nmero rcord de hospitalizaciones, lo cual es particularmente preocupante, ya que sabemos que cuando nuestros centros de salud estn desbordados, nuestra capacidad para tratar a las personas gravemente enfermas se ve limitada En Mxico ya se ha superado el milln de casos de COVID-19 y en Canad tambin hay un resurgimiento de la transmisin","output":"Rueda de prensa semanal sobre COVID-19: palabras de apertura de la directora, 18 de noviembre de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the delta variant of COVID-19, known as B.1.617.2, quickly ramping up infections around the world, we need to understand what makes this variant more contagious.

We analysed the Twitter profiles of 98 health journalists from seven major media organizations in the US and conducted a manual content analysis of a representative sample of their public tweets (n?=?3982) published during the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast to expectations, branding contributed little to any indicators of visibility, and profiles with institutional branding had fewer followers. Both affective messages and rational messages received more likes and retweets than messages without these elements. Tweets containing images or news-related hyperlinks received more retweets, whereas the number of @mentions in a tweet was negatively related to visibility.

Those studies that mainly focused on young children, reached different conclusions regarding both the existence of such a link and the season with the highest risk. The purpose of this study was to reinvestigate the relationship between birth season and asthma in a very large cohort, larger than in all previous studies, focusing on adolescents. METHODS The medical records of consecutive 17-year-old conscripts, born between 1978 and 1999, undergoing medical evaluation before their military service, were reviewed. The prevalence of asthma among conscripts was calculated according to the season of birth. RESULTS Data from 6 26 460 males and 4 54 104 females were collected. Asthma prevalence was 6.6% of the males and 5.8% of the females. Asthma prevalence was highest among those born in the summer and was approximately 9% higher in women and 6% higher in men than those born in the winter. Those born in the winter had the lowest prevalence of asthma. June was the birth month with the highest prevalence of asthma in both genders together with September among males. CONCLUSIONS Being born in the summer, especially in June, is associated with an increased risk of asthma compared with a winter birth among Israeli army conscripts.

Rather than build entirely new robotic systems, we propose to augment existing rigid-bodied robots with an external touch-perception system. This practical approach can enable researchers and caregivers to continue to use robotic technology they have already purchased and learned about, but with a myriad of new social-touch interactions possible. This paper presents a low-cost, easy-to-build, soft tactile-perception system that we created for the NAO robot, as well as participants feedback on touching this system. We installed four of our fabric-and-foam-based resistive sensors on the curved surfaces of a NAOs left arm, including its hand, lower arm, upper arm, and shoulder. Fifteen adults then performed five types of affective touch-communication gestures (hitting, poking, squeezing, stroking, and tickling) at two force intensities (gentle and energetic) on the four sensor locations; we share this dataset of four time-varying resistances, our sensor patterns, and a characterization of the sensors physical performance. After training, a gesture-classification algorithm based on a random forest identified the correct combined touch gesture and force intensity on windows of held-out test data with an average accuracy of 74.1%, which is more than eight times better than chance. Participants rated the sensor-equipped arm as pleasant to touch and liked the robots presence significantly more after touch interactions. Our promising results show that this type of tactile-perception system can detect necessary social-touch communication cues from users, can be tailored to a variety of robot body parts, and can provide HRI researchers with the tools needed to implement social touch in their own systems.","output":"Endowing a NAO Robot With Practical Social-Touch Perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The serious respiratory disease, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), outbreaking in winter of 2003 to 2004 remained in a sporadic patient's generating at this winter.

In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (Schrems II) placed heavy conditions on their use. The Schrems II Court found that SCCs were valid as appropriate safeguards for data transfers from EU entities to others outside the EU/EEA as long as unspecified supplementary measures were in place to compensate for the lack of data protection in the third country. Data protection officers are under intense pressure to explain these measures and allow routine transfers to continue. Some authorities interpret the decision as preventing the use of SCCs to transfer personal data outside of the EU because private contracts cannot comprehensively redress gaps in national law. This article argues that these authorities are mistaken and that notwithstanding Schrems II SCCs can still be useful instruments for cross-border transfers. This is especially true in highly regulated contexts such as medical research. This paper traces the history of SCCs under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and shows how the CJEU in Schrems II misunderstood the purpose of SCCs and other Article 46 GDPR appropriate safeguards. The CJEU mistakenly approached Article 46 safeguards such as SCCs as being similar to country-specific adequacy rulings under Article 45 GDPR. But unlike Article 45 adequacy rulings, SCCs were not intended to provide a stand-alone mechanism for transfer reliant on the law of the importing country. Rather SCCs provide an alternative, multi-layered standard for data protection that encompasses law, technology and organizational commitments. Their purpose is to be used in situations where legislation alone is insufficient to protect data subject rights.

Drawing on longstanding themes of continuity and change in youth leisure scholarship, this paper contributes to our understandings of liminal leisure as experienced by some young people in the UK before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we place primary pre-pandemic research on disadvantaged young peoples leisure spaces and practices in dialogue with secondary data on lockdown and post-lockdown leisure. Subsequently, we argue that existing and emergent forms of youth leisure liminality are best understood through the lens of intersectional disadvantages. Specifically, pre-existing intersectional disadvantages are being compounded by disruptions to youth leisure, as the upheaval of the pandemic continues to be differentially experienced. To understand this process, we deploy the concept of liminal leisure spaces used by Swaine et al Leisure Studies 37:4,440-451, (2018) in their ethnography of Khat-chewing among young British Somali urban youth on the margins. Similarly, our focus is on young peoples management and negotiation of substance use risks, harms and pleasures when in private-in-public leisure spaces. We note that the UK government responses to the pandemic, such as national and regional lockdowns, meant that the leisure liminality of disadvantaged young people pre-pandemic became the experience of young people more generally, with for example the closure of night-time economies (NTEs). Yet despite some temporary convergence, intersectionally disadvantaged young people at leisure have been subject to a particularly problematic confluence of criminalisation, exclusion and stigmatisation in COVID-19 times, which will most likely continue into the post-pandemic future.","output":"The Liminal Leisure of Disadvantaged Young People in the UK Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is an ongoing, global public health crisis for which safe and effective treatments need to be identified. The benefit-risk balance for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required because of the urgent unmet public need. Importantly, it allows additional data to be incorporated as they become available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile. METHODS: A systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in severe COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance. RESULTS: We screened 143 papers from PubMed and 264 papers from Embase for lopinavir-ritonavir; seven papers were included in the final benefit-risk assessment. In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.95-1.80). From one study, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared with standard of care (13% vs 27%). There also appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events. There was a reduction in acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir in one study.

Pre-hospital and in-hospital acute stroke pathways were reorganized to prioritize COVID-19 management and, in severely affected regions of Italy and France, stroke care was centralized to a limited number of centers, whereas the remaining stroke units were dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Access to acute stroke diagnostics and time-dependent therapies was limited or delayed because of reduced capacities of emergency services due to the burden of patients with COVID-19. A marked reduction in the number of patients presenting with transient ischaemic attack and stroke was noted in the emergency departments of all three countries.

Patients' demographic and clinical data recorded and analysed are the following: age, gender, previous ocular history, aetiology, symptoms onset, type of symptoms, discharge diagnosis, urgency and severity of diagnosis. RESULTS OED consultations dropped from 20.6  7.3 visits/day of the COVID-free period to 8.6  4.6 visits/day of the COVID-period. In the COVID-period patients waited longer before physically going to the OED, lamented more vision loss and less redness and reported a higher percentage of traumatic events when compared to the COVID-free period.

The current global challenge highlighted the need to develop a rapid and cost-effective strategy to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in viral infections. Viruses can use the host lipid machinery to support their life cycle and to impair the host immune response. The altered expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes, induced by several viruses, assures survival and spread in host tissue. In some infections, statins, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, reduce cholesterol in the plasma membrane of permissive cells resulting in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus. Statins can also counteract viral infections through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Beyond statins, interfering with the mevalonate pathway could have an adjuvant effect in therapies aimed at mitigating endothelial dysfunction and deregulated inflammation in viral infection. In this review we depicted the historical and current evidence highlighting how lipid homeostasis and mevalonate pathway targeting represents a valid approach to rapidly neutralize viruses, focusing our attention to their potential use as effective targets to hinder SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality.

Data were imported into NVIVO-12 and coded, with key concepts compared, organised into higher order constructs, then structured into a theoretical framework. Results: Gurriny responded to COVID-19 by leading with local solutions to keep Yarrabah safe. Four key strategies were implemented: managing the health service operations, realigning services, educating and supporting community, and working across agencies. These strategies were enabled or hindered by five conditions: the governance and leadership capcity of Gurriny, relying on the health taskforce, locking the door, copping it, and (not) having resources. A year after the first case was experienced in Australia and on the eve of vaccine rollout to Indigenous communities, there have been no COVID-19 cases in Yarrabah. Discussion The success of the locally-led, holistic, comprehensive and culturally safe response of Gurriny suggests that such tailored place-based approaches to pandemics (and other health issues) are appropriate, but require dedicated resourcing. Key challenges related to fragmented and rapidly changing government processes, poorly coordinated communication and resource allocation channels, and bottlenecks in hierarchical funding approval processes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 response in Yarrabah demonstrates the need for governance reform towards greater resourcing and support for local decision making.","output":"Leading with local solutions to keep Yarrabah safe: A grounded theory study of an Aboriginal community- controlled health organisations response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the main plasma volume regulator, which maintains cardiovascular and hydrosaline homeostasis. In the classical pathway, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) generates Angiotensin II (AngII), which is powerfully inflammatory and vasoconstrictive. This classical pathway is also regulated by ACE2, which converts AngI to Ang 1-9, and degrades AngII to Ang 1-7, whose vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory functions balance out the effects of AngII. ACE2 has been associated with the pathogenesis of respiratory infections such as RSV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have shown that ACE2 corresponds to the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor, which together with other receptors such as the TMPRSS2, allows the virus to attach, fuse, and enter the host cell. These studies have shown that in animals infected with coronavirus there is a drop in tissue concentration of ACE2 and Ang 1-7, leading to overexpression of AngII and its vasoconstrictive and inflammatory effects. Experiments with recombinant ACE2 have shown a protective effect against overexpression of RAAS in coronavirus-infected animals, which is similar to that demonstrated with the use of AngII receptor blockers (AT1). Evidence on the protective role of ACE2 seems to support the recommendations re garding not discontinuing these drugs in COVID-19 infection. In this article, we present the current knowledge about the role of RAAS in coronavirus infection, based on physiopathological concepts, molecular bases, and experimental and clinical evidence.","output":"[Renin Angiotensin Axis, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 and Coronavirus]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The timely management of cancer surgery suffered due to COVID-19 and nationwide lockdown.

We aim to evaluate the management of this mass casualty incident highlighting the lessons learned to be used in preparedness for similar incidents that may occur in other major cities worldwide. METHODS: Information regarding incident site and hospital management response were analysed. Data on demography, triaging, injuries and hospital management of patients were collected according to a designed protocol. Challenges, difficulties and their solutions were reported. RESULTS: The train's emergency response team (ERT) has shut down train movements towards the incident site. Red zone (in the tunnel), yellow zone (the station platform) and green zone (outside the station entrance) were established. The fire and rescue team arrived and assisted the ERT in the red zone. Incident command system was established at the site. Medical base station was established at the yellow zone. Two hundred and fourteen passengers were in the trains. Sixty-four of them were injured. They had a median (range) ISS of 2 (1C43), and all were sent to Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL). Six (9.4%) patients were clinically triaged as red (critical), 19 (29.7%) as yellow (semi-critical) and 39 (60.9%) as green (non-critical). HKL's disaster plan was activated. All patients underwent temperature and epidemiology link assessment. Seven (10.9%) patients were admitted to the hospital (3 to the ICU, 3 to the ward and 1 to a private hospital as requested by the patient), while the rest 56 (87.5%) were discharged home. Six (9.4%) needed surgery. The COVID-19 tests were conducted on seven patients (10.9%) and were negative. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The mass casualty incident was handled properly because of a clear standard operating procedure, smooth coordination between multi-agencies and the hospitals, presence of a 'binary' system for 'COVID-risk' and 'non-COVID-risk' areas, and the modifications of the existing disaster plan. Preparedness for MCIs is essential during pandemics.","output":"Kuala Lumpur train collision during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare but devastating adverse event associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) adenoviral vaccine against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute right limb ischemia (Rutherford IIB) nine days after his ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccination. CT angiography revealed significant aortic thrombosis and right femoral artery occlusion. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 23  103/L), promptly elevated D-dimers (37937 ng/mL) and a reduced fibrinogen level (176 mg/dL) were remarkable. ELISA testing for anti-PF4 antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of VITT. RESULTS: An emergency revascularization of the right leg was provided via thrombectomy. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins were administered whereafter the platelet count restored gradually. Therapeutic anticoagulation was progressively started. The postoperative course was uneventful and follow-up imaging after four weeks showed an almost complete resolution of the significant aortic thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Early recognition and appropriate counseling of VITT is advocated to pursue a good clinical outcome. Our patient presenting with severe aortic thrombosis and acute limb ischemia was successfully treated by a vascular thrombectomy along with intravenous immunoglobulins and anticoagulation therapy as the mainstay therapy.","output":"Aortic thrombosis and acute limb ischemia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccination: a case of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), the worst pandemic in more than a century, has claimed >125,000 lives worldwide to date.

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective OSAS treatment;however, adherence to CPAP therapy is problematic with psychological symptoms and other sleep disorders. We investigated whether a difference existed between device compatibility of patients with OSAS who applied to the sleep outpatient clinic during the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and normalization process and those who applied during preepidemic period. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective study. Patients with OSAS who applied to the sleep disorders center for device control between March 27, 2020 and July 1, 2020 and who used a device for at least one year were included. CPAP adherence time during this period and the same period in 2019 were compared. Results: This study included 190 patients. Regarding the usage times of the device, the average usage time before the pandemic was 5.30.6 hours, whereas after the pandemic, it was 4.50.9 hours. The device usage time of 54 patients was over four hours before the pandemic;however, it decreased to under four hours after the pandemic. Regarding insomnia, anxiety, and circadian rhythm disorder, there was a significant difference between patients with adequate device use times and patients with inadequate device use times. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic period, additional sleep disorders, such as insomnia, circadian rhythm disorder, nightmare disorder, and psychological problems, like anxiety symptoms, were expeienced by patients with OSAS. These added sleep and psychological problems affected the device compatibility of patients with OSAS.

A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic group-shuffle-split paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the pound-for-pound information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.","output":"A Genotype-to-Phenotype Modeling Framework to Predict Human Pathogenicity of Novel Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During January 1, 2020-August 10, 2020, an estimated 5 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in the United States.* Published state and national data indicate that persons of color might be more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, experience more severe COVID-19-associated illness, including that requiring hospitalization, and have higher risk for death from COVID-19 (1-5).

During June 5-18, 205 counties in 33 states were identified as hotspots; among these counties, race was reported for 50% of cumulative cases in 79 (38.5%) counties in 22 states; 96.2% of these counties had disparities in COVID-19 cases in one or more underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) persons were the largest group by population size (3.5 million persons) living in hotspot counties where a disproportionate number of cases among that group was identified, followed by black/African American (black) persons (2 million), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (61,000), Asian persons (36,000), and Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander (NHPI) persons (31,000). Examining county-level data disaggregated by race/ethnicity can help identify health disparities in COVID-19 cases and inform strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. More complete race/ethnicity data are needed to fully inform public health decision-making. Addressing the pandemic's disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in communities of color can reduce the community-wide impact of COVID-19 and improve health outcomes.","output":"Disparities in Incidence of COVID-19 Among Underrepresented Racial/Ethnic Groups in Counties Identified as Hotspots During June 5C18, 2020  22 States, FebruaryCJune 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) posted reports claiming that chiropractic care can impact the immune system. These claims clash with recommendations from the World Health Organization and World Federation of Chiropractic. We discuss the scientific validity of the claims made in these ICA reports. MAIN BODY: We reviewed the two reports posted by the ICA on their website on March 20 and March 28, 2020. We explored the method used to develop the claim that chiropractic adjustments impact the immune system and discuss the scientific merit of that claim. We provide a response to the ICA reports and explain why this claim lacks scientific credibility and is dangerous to the public. More than 150 researchers from 11 countries reviewed and endorsed our response. CONCLUSION: In their reports, the ICA provided no valid clinical scientific evidence that chiropractic care can impact the immune system. We call on regulatory authorities and professional leaders to take robust political and regulatory action against those claiming that chiropractic adjustments have a clinical impact on the immune system.","output":"A united statement of the global chiropractic research community against the pseudoscientific claim that chiropractic care boosts immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to highlight the common early\\\\stage clinical and laboratory variables independently related to the acute phase duration in patients with uncomplicated coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pneumonia.

METHODS: A multicenter survey was carried out. Eight hundred and nine patients completed the Chinese version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer (DT), the three-dimensional inventory of character strengths, the medical coping modes questionnaire, and the Social Support Rating Scale. RESULTS: The current prevalence of psychological distress in Chinese AYAs with cancer was 83.4%. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, marriage, monthly income, exercise intensity, cancer classifications, treatments, self-control, confrontation, avoidance, and subjective support were all associated with distress. AYA cancer patients who were female, younger, or divorced or had a lower monthly income, education level, or exercise intensity were more likely to have higher level of distress. Compared to AYAs with other cancer classifications, patients with digestive system malignancies, breast cancers, and head and neck malignancies had a higher prevalence of distress. Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy were more likely to be distressed. The higher the self-control, confrontation, avoidance, and subjective support scores were, the lower the prevalence of distress was among AYA cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients was relatively high.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine ways in which COVID-19 has affected the bereavement experiences of parents whose children died from cancer prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Parents who participated in a survey-based study examining the early grief experience were invited to complete a semi-structured interview. During the interview, which focused on examining the current support for parents and other family members within the first several years following the childs death, participants were asked how COVID-19 has impacted their life and bereavement. RESULTS: Fifteen of thirty-three eligible parents completed the interview; 14 were White and non-Hispanic, 5 were male. Parents participated an average of 19 (range 12-34) months after their childs death. COVID-19 was addressed in 13 interviews. Eleven codes were used to describe interview segments; the most commonly used codes were change in support, no effect, familiarity with uncertainty/ability to cope and change in contact with care/research team. CONCLUSION: Parents identified multiple and variable ways C both positive, negative and neutral C how COVID-19 has affected their bereavement. While many parents commented on feeling more isolated because of the inability to connect with family or attend in-person support groups, others acknowledged their experience has made them uniquely positioned to cope with the uncertainty of the current situation.

Novel transcatheter heart valves (THV) with a lower profile, ease of use and expected longer durability are being developed to target younger and low-risk population. Myval is a 14Fr-balloon expandable THV with a skirt to minimize the occurrence of paravalvular leak (PVL), and has been recently approved for commercial use in Brazil. We sought to report our initial experience with this novel device. Methods: Single-center, single arm, open label prospective registry encompassing all consecutive patients referred to TAVR in our Institution between December 2020 and November 2021. Indication for TAVR was according to current international guidelines. Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were defined accordingly to VARC-III criteria. Results: A total of 39 patients were enrolled so far. Mean age was 79.5 years, 42% were female and mean STS score was 4%. Pre-procedures mean gradient and aortic valve area were 53.3 mmHg and 0.7cm2, respectively. All procedures were performed under minimalist approach using percutaneous, femoral access. Two patients were treated for bicuspid aortic stenosis and four patients underwent a valve-in-valve procedure. Procedure success was achieved in 100% of the cases, and post-procedure echocardiogram revealed a mean residual gradient of 5 mmHg, with PVL greater than mild in a single case. Permanent pacemaker was required in only 2 patients, and mean hospital stay was 3.1 days. At 30-days, there were two deaths, one due to COVID in a patient who presented major access bleeding requiring prolonged hospital stay, and another one a cardiovascular death. Conclusion: In our initial experience with the Myval THV, valve performance and 30-day clinical results were encouraging.

World health organization (WHO) had recommended online education to keep social distance which still needs further evaluation. This study aimed to examine whether an open online course is superior to conventional education in emergency nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two groups of conventional education students (CG) and two groups of students participating in an online course that utilized an application (called SuperStar) as the SuperStar Group (SSG) were studied to compare their abilities in the process of new knowledge acquisition. The SSG was divided into a blended group (S1) and an online group (S2). The emergency nursing course was scheduled in 16 independent classes, which contained stochastic tests at least eight times. RESULTS: The CG group showed better performance on the final exam than the SSG group, but there was no statistically significant difference. The CG group obtained better scores on the memory capacity tests while the SSG had better scores on the application capacity tests. The SSG group scored higher on the later tests during the process of education compared to the CG group. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension of an emergency nursing course was stronger in the SSG group than in the CG group.

The objective of the present study was to elucidate the effect of B. subtilis spores as adjuvants in chickens administered inactivated avian influenza virus H9N2. Herein, the adjuvanticity of B. subtilis spores in chickens was demonstrated by enhancement of H9N2 virus-specific IgG responses. B. subtilis spores enhanced the proportion of B cells and the innate cell population in splenocytes from chickens administered both inactivated H9N2 and B. subtilis spores (Spore + H9N2). Furthermore, the H9N2 and spore administration induced significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 compared to that in the H9N2 only group. Additionally, total splenocytes from chickens immunized with inactivated H9N2 in the presence or absence of B. subtilis spores were re-stimulated with inactivated H9N2. The subsequent results showed that the extent of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation was higher in the Spore + H9N2 group than in the group administered only H9N2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that B. subtilis spores, as adjuvants, enhance not only H9N2 virus-specific IgG but also CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This approach to vaccination with inactivated H9N2 together with a B. subtilis spore adjuvant in chickens produces a significant effect on antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses against avian influenza virus.","output":"Bacillus subtilis spores as adjuvants against avian influenza H9N2 induce antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses in White Leghorn chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to discuss the relations between the built environment and the patients health, considering the context of the pandemic experienced since 2020.

However, analysis of immunity against SARS-COV-2 is currently lacking. METHODS: Here, we analyzed T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike-, membrane-, and nucleocapsid-protein by flow cytometry and spike-specific neutralizing antibodies in ten Tx in comparison to 26 nonimmunosuppressed (non-Tx) COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tx-patients (seven renal, one lung, and two combined pancreas-kidney transplants) were recruited in this study during the acute phase of COVID-19 with a median time after SARS-CoV-2-positivity of 3 and 4 days for non-Tx- and Tx-patients, respectively. Despite immunosuppression, we detected antiviral CD4 T cell-response in 90% of Tx-patients. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells produced multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating their potential protective capacity. Neutralizing antibody-titers did not differ between groups. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells targeting membrane- and spike-protein were lower in Tx-patients, albeit without statistical significance. However, frequencies of anti-nucleocapsid-protein-reactive, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyfunctional CD8 T cells, were similar between patient cohorts. Tx-patients showed features of a prematurely aged adaptive immune system, but equal frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a polyfunctional T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2-proteins as well as neutralizing antibodies can be generated in Tx-patients despite immunosuppression. In comparison to nonimmunosuppressed-patients, no differences in humoral and cellular antiviral-immunity were found.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of hormones and metabolic factors in the proliferation and death of endometrium during the proliferative phase. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 11 women with PCOS and eight normal-cycling non-PCOS controls at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro from February 2011 to June 2019. Clinical, biochemical, and hormonal data were collected to analyze their influence on the expression of biomarkers related to the endometrial tissue breakdown. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsies were conducted, and the endometrial samples underwent immunohistochemistry for markers of apoptosis B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3), fas cell surface death receptor (FAS), FAS ligand (FASLG), BCL2 associated X (BAX), marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67), and cell death using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: CASP3 and TUNEL expressions were lower in both stroma and endometrium gland of PCOS women than in controls. MKI67 and homeostasis indexes (BCL2/BAX; FASLG/FAS) in the endometrium of the PCOS group were significantly higher. Body mass index (BMI) values were positively correlated with the expression of MKI67 and MKI67/TUNEL ratio in the endometrial stroma compartment.

Although the release of these technologies has great potential for generating health-related information, it is important to acknowledge the repercussions of consumer-targeted biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs), which in practice, are often used for medical decision making. BioMeTs are bodily connected digital medicine products that process data captured by mobile sensors that use algorithms to generate measures of behavioral and physiological function. These BioMeTs span both general wellness products and medical devices, and consumer-targeted BioMeTs intended for general wellness purposes are not required to undergo a standardized and transparent evaluation process for ensuring their quality and accuracy. The combination of product functionality, marketing, and the circumstances of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have inevitably led to the use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs for reporting health-related measurements to drive medical decision making. In this viewpoint, we urge consumer-targeted BioMeT manufacturers to go beyond the bare minimum requirements described in US Food and Drug Administration guidance when releasing information on wellness BioMeTs. We also explore new methods and incentive systems that may result in a clearer public understanding of the performance and intended use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs.","output":"Wearables in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: What Are They Good for?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With emerging interest in the use of telemedicine, allergy-immunology should be at the forefront of adoption and implementation of these services Patients report a greater desire for telemedicine services as well as satisfaction with video-based visits with their providers Interim virtual visits can accommodate overscheduled clinics, reduce burdens of travel to distant sites, improve access to subspecialty care, and increase adherence during monitoring of chronic allergic conditions The outpatient nature of allergy-immunology coupled with the ease of conducting many aspects of a routine visit via telemedicine makes the incorporation of telehealth training into fellowship programs highly desirable The short-term closure of hospital-affiliated clinics, in particular, for vulnerable or immunodeficient patients, in the setting of a global pandemic demonstrates the timeliness of this topic A framework for implementing telemedicine into the allergy-immunology curriculum, training faculty on appropriate supervision, providing elective clinical experience in the form of continuity clinics, and simulating telemedicine delivery is discussed Proposed telemedicine competencies desired for the independent practice of telemedicine are suggested","output":"The Future of Telehealth in Allergy and Immunology Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new and unparalleled stress-test for the already disrupted liberal-representative, democracies The challenges cluster around three democratic disfigurations: technocracy, populism, and plebiscitarianism-each have the potential to contribute to democratic decay Still, they can also trigger pushback against illiberalism mobilizing citizens in defense of democracy, toward democratic resilience This article looks at how the COVID-19 pandemic affects democratic decay and democratic resilience in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) It finds varied responses to the COVID-19 crisis by the CEE populist leaders and identifies two patterns: the rise of autocracy and democratic resilience First, in Hungary and Poland, the populist leaders instrumentalized the state of emergency to increase executive aggrandizement Second, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, democracy proved resilient The COVID-19 pandemic alone is not fostering the rise of authoritarianism However, it does accentuate existing democratic disfigurations","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Central and Eastern Europe The Rise of Autocracy and Democratic Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Because the lack of consensus on defining knowledge, coupled with its associated knowledge iceberg phenomenon, is a key barrier to effectively managing dispersed knowledge in the Internet-driven cross-cultural business model (CBM), we synthesised an ontological and epistemological understanding with the view of existential phenomenology, proposing a dynamic hierarchical system of knowledge and three primary knowledge iceberg archetypes as metaphors of cognitive variances in this context.

Lockdown plays an important role in the arrest of community spread of the disease. This was evident from the study of other countries such as Russia, Belgium and Germany, where peak cases were recorded within a month of the imposition of lockdown, that it showed an immediate positive effect. However, in India, even after 65 days of lockdown, there is no decrease in the number of daily new cases reported. There were many models prepared for India and almost all of them were proven wrong by the increase in the number of cases. The model in this paper is prepared using the COVID-19 trend in other countries, population density and the pandemic bell curve. Based on the available data until 24th May 2020, two scenarios have been presented. In one, the peak shall be obtained when the number of daily new cases per million reaches 190 and in the second when the daily new cases per million reach 724. One model predicts the number of cases to reach 1 million by mid-July 2020. The other model predicts the number of cases to peak by mid-July with the total cases reaching 20 million. The predicted cases were compared with the actual cases recorded for the period 25th May to 11th June 2020.

Besides its high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple serious derangements, where the most prominent is severe acute respiratory syndrome as well as multiple organ dysfunction including heart and kidney injury. While the deleterious impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary and cardiac systems have attracted remarkable attention, the adverse effects of this virus on the renal system is still underestimated. Kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is used as port of the viral entry into targeted cells, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and subsequent viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry receptor, ACE2, is widely expressed in proximal epithelial cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and podocytes, where it supports kidney integrity and function via the enzymatic production of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which exerts vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and diuretic/natriuretic actions via activation of the Mas receptor axis. Loss of this activity constitutes the potential basis for the renal damage that occurs in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, several studies in a small sample of COVID-19 patients revealed relatively high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among them. Although SARS-CoV-1 -induced AKI was attributed to multiorgan failure and cytokine release syndrome, as the virus was not detectable in the renal tissue of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in kidney tubules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects the human kidney directly, and eventually induces AKI characterized with high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. However, the fact that ACE2 plays a crucial role against renal injury, the deprivation of the kidney of this advantageous enzyme, along with local viral replication, probably plays a central role. The current review focuses on the critical role of ACE2 in renal physiology, its involvement in the development of kidney injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection, renal manifestations and therapeutic options. The latter includes exogenous administration of Ang (1-7) as an appealing option, given the high incidence of AKI in this ACE2-depleted disorder, and the benefits of ACE2/Ang1-7 including vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, apoptosis and coagulation.","output":"Renal Manifestations of Covid-19: Physiology and Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess anxiety, stress level, and perception of safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in health care workers (HCWs) of one of Germany's largest urology university clinics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among urological HCWs was performed. HCWs were surveyed for anxiety about the pandemic, stress level and current workload, fear of coronavirus infection, current perception of safety at work, and attitude towards protective equipment and tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Sixty-three HCWs filled in the questionnaire. Overall anxiety of infection with CO-VID-19 is at a median of 4.7 with no statistically significant difference between nurses and physicians (p = 0.0749). Safety at work reaches a median of 6 out of 10. In fact, the highest fear in 56.7% (31/63) of the personnel is to get infected by a colleague tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing surgical face masks. A proportion of 55.7 and 74.6% highly favor swabs for SARS-CoV-2 on a regular basis in HCWs and patients, respectively (p = 0.0001). Workload in the urology department is clearly reduced during the pandemic (physicians 39.3% vs. nurses 32.2%, p = 0.0001) and 57.4% do not feel distress at all; only 27.9% express mental distress. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, urology HCWs perceive lower burden by workload and deem themselves at low risk of infection. However, the greatest anxiety is related to infection by a SARS-CoV-2-positive colleague, despite reciprocal protection by surgical face masks.

Therefore, several newer self-report measures for FM criteria have emerged. The aim of this study was to translate the fibromyalgia survey questionnaire (FSQ) to Norwegian and validate both the 2011 and the 2016 fibromyalgia survey diagnostic criteria (FSDC) against the ACR1990 criteria. Methods One hundred and twenty chronic pain patients formerly diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to the ACR1990 criteria, and 62 controls not diagnosed or where fibromyalgia was not suspected, were enrolled in this study. All responded to a Norwegian version of the FSQ. Also, they had a clinical examination according to ACR1990 fibromyalgia criteria including a counting of significant tender points with an algometer (TPC). The FSQ with the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity scale (SSS) subscales, Fibromyalgia Severity (FS) sum score, was examined for correlations with the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) and TPCs. Face-validity, internal consistence, test-retest reliability and construct validity with convergent and divergent approaches were examined and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed. Results The internal consistency of FS measured by Cronbach's alfa was good (=0.904). The test-retest reliability measures using intra class correlation were respectable for the FS, including WPI and SSS subscales (0.86, 0.84 and 0.87). FS, WPI and SSS correlated significantly with FIQ (0.74, 0.59 and 0.85) and TPC indicating an adequate construct, convergent validity. The medians of FS, WPI and SSS in the fibromyalgia-group were significantly different from the non-fibromyalgia-group indicating good construct, divergent validity. Using the 2011 and 2016 FSDC vs. ACR 1990 as a reference, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR +) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were identified. The accuracy rate for both 2011 and 2016 FSDC were respectable (84%). ROC analysis using FS revealed a very good Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.860.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate associations between LUS signs at the time of screening and clinical outcomes 1 month after LUS and to assess LUS signs at the time of presentation with known risk factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of data prospectively collected 1 month after LUS screening of 447 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Sonographic examination was performed in screening tents with the participants seated. The LUS signs (B-lines > 2, coalescent B-lines, and subpleural consolidations) were captured in six areas of each hemithorax and a LUS aeration score was calculated; in addition, the categories of disease probability based on patterns of LUS findings (high-probability, intermediate-probability, alternate, and low-probability patterns) were evaluated. The LUS signs at patients' initial evaluation were related to the following outcomes: symptomatology, the need for hospitalization or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and COVID-19-related death. RESULTS: According to the evaluations performed 1 month after LUS screening, 36 patients were hospitalised, eight of whom required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and three of whom died. The presence of coalescent B-lines was associated with the need for hospitalization (p = 0.008). The presence of subpleural consolidations was associated with dyspnoea (p < 0.0001), cough (p = 0.003), the need for hospitalization (p < 0.0001), the need for ICU admission (p < 0.0001), and death (p = 0.002). A higher aeration score was associated with dyspnoea (p < 0.0001), the need for hospitalization (p < 0.0001), the need for ICU admission (p < 0.0001), and death (p = 0.003). In addition, patients with a high-probability LUS pattern had a higher aeration score (p < 0.0001) and more dyspnoea (p = 0.024) and more often required hospitalization (p < 0.0001) and ICU admission (p = 0.031).

The objective of this study was to assess the craving and withdrawal coping mechanisms used by patients with SUDs as a result of disruption in availability of substances and medications due to sudden lockdown in response to coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A survey was administered via telephone from June 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020, to patients who had previously attended the substance use clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India from January 1, 2020, to March 21, 2020 (up to the time of lockdown). Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained from case record files. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to collect information on coping with craving and withdrawal symptoms. A total of 215 patients were registered in the substance use clinic during this period for the treatment of SUDs, and of those, 43 could not be contacted due to various reasons such as wrong contact numbers, patient expired (not related to substance withdrawal), or not willing to talk. The mean age of the subjects was 37.05 (SD = 13.22) years, and men outnumbered women. The remaining 172 patients were contacted via telephone, and responses were gathered regarding withdrawal symptoms and coping with craving. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of the patients were still maintaining abstinence from their primary substance of abuse during lockdown. A large number of patients (n = 41, 43.2%) reported difficulty in obtaining prescribed medication for detoxification without renewal of their prescription. More than 66% of patients reported that they were able to control their craving, and many kept themselves busy with household activities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who had completed the acute phase of withdrawals were able to maintain abstinence in the absence of renewal of prescribed medication and substance of abuse due to sudden disruption in supply. The patients were able to use certain strategies to control their craving.","output":"Coping With Craving and Withdrawal Due to Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Situations of psychological stress, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to an increase in the consumption of alcohol and other drugs of abuse as an inadequate coping strategy in health workers.

To alleviate the situation, the effective allocation of scarce medical resources during the pandemic plays a vital role. The essence of the healthcare system in time of emergency is to stay functional, and to be able to diagnose and hospitalize as many patients as possible. Fangcang shelter hospital, as a novel way to temporarily increase the capacity of the local healthcare system, is proven to be effective against the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve the performance of the healthcare system with Fangcang, many practical factors need to be taken into account, such as the patient deterioration during waiting to be admitted, the referral mechanism according to the severity of the patients, and the selective admission regulations. To address the high volatility and time-varying feature of the COVID-19, a multistage and multi-type medical service network model is established, and a dynamic allocation strategy of the medical resources at each stage is proposed based on a stochastic optimization problem, which is then solved via the fluid queueing approximation. Combined with the real data collected from Wuhan, it is revealed that the proposed algorithm could help with the allocation of medical resources during the outbreak of epidemics. Even with limited medical resources available, the method could still maintain a guaranteed service level while keeping the healthcare system operational. Furthermore, the simulation analysis validates that our method can effectively allocate medical resources at each stage, so as to stabilize the system performance and fulfill the medical demand for multiple types of patients. Note to PractitionersTo fend off the outbreak of epidemics, the lessons have to be learned from the past. The successful control of the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan (China) is a classical example of applying modern medical practices and management tools. In the present article, the treating procedure of COVID-19 in Wuhan is modeled as a multistage decision problem, which includes the screening with nucleic acid testing, the further testing, the treatment of patients with mild/severe symptoms, or even critical patients. The introduction of Fangcang shelter hospital is crucial for winning the battle against COVID-19. The current study attempts to determine the timing of introducing the Fangcang shelter hospital during the outbreak of a major epidemic, and helps allocate the medical resources needed to contain the spread of the virus. It is discovered that the actual number of beds in the Fangcang shelter hospital is far more than what is necessary, and it would be better to have built the Fangcang some time in advance. In the meantime, the number of designated hospitals for COVID-19 is in line with the results obtained via the optimal staffing strategy proposed here, but it is also noticeable that these hospitals should be released of duty sooner to fight against not only COVID-19 but also other diseases in reality.

Few studies included pre-pandemic levels of mental health or were comprehensive in assessing factors likely associated with longer-term mental health impacts. METHODS: Analyses used prospective data from a subset of participants in the nationwide Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) United States cohort (N=2,359; 1,534 women; 825 men) who completed surveys in 2018 and during the COVID-19 pandemic (July-September 2020). Logistic regressions examined associations of pandemic-related stressors, sociodemographic and other predictors with (i) overall psychological distress (PD) and depression and anxiety separately during the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) change in PD from 2018 to during the pandemic (low/low; high to low; low to high; high/high). FINDINGS: During the pandemic, 10% of participants reported moderate-to-severe PD and almost half (42%) reported at least mild PD. Pandemic PD levels were associated with pre-pandemic PD (female OR=5.65; male OR=9.70), financial stressors (female OR=2.48; male OR=3.68), and work/life balance stressors (female OR=3.03; male OR=3.33) experienced since the pandemic began. These stressors also predicted an escalation from low PD in 2018 to high PD during the pandemic. Factors associated with high PD at both time points included younger age, female sex, and financial stressors. INTERPRETATION: These results highlight the importance of regular mental health assessment and support among those with a history of mental health problems and those experiencing pandemic-related stressors, such as those with caregiving responsibilities or job changes.

We report a case series of five patients with new-onset neurological disorders of inflammatory or immunological origin temporally associated with these vaccines. METHODS: A case-series of five patients within a single 23-hospital health system who developed new-onset CNS inflammatory disease within 2 weeks of receiving a dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. RESULTS: Five cases of post-vaccination CNS disorders of immune origin (fatal ADEM; n = 1, new-onset NMOSD; n = 2, new-clinical onset MS-like syndrome but with preexisting clinically silent mild demyelination; n = 1, meningoencephalitis; n = 1) observed within 2 weeks of inoculation with either the first or second dose of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Moderna = 3, Pfizer = 2). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, these are among the emerging cases of CNS adverse events of immunological or inflammatory origin. These findings should be interpreted with great caution as they neither prove a mechanistic link nor imply a potential long-term increased risk in post-vaccination CNS autoimmunity. Larger prospective studies assessing the potential association between mRNA-based vaccination and the development of neurological adverse events of suspected immune origin, particularly among those with underlying CNS or systemic autoimmune disorders, are needed.

This treatment provides higher recanalization rates for occluded vessels but may lead to hemorrhagic complications such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results were announced for three randomized controlled trials in 2013, with all failing to show the superiority of endovascular treatment. These results have had a major negative impact, but a new randomized controlled trial, the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), showed that acute endovascular treatment was superior to standard medical treatment in terms of clinical outcomes. With this positive result, interim analyses from other randomized trials appear likely to show the effectiveness of endovascular treatment.

The affinities of proteins for Zn(2+) ions span several orders of magnitude, with catalytic Zn(2+) ions generally held more tightly than structural or regulatory ones. Metal carrier proteins, most of which are not specific for Zn(2+), bind these ions with a broad range of affinities that overlap those of catalytic, structural, and regulatory Zn(2+) ions and are thought to be responsible for distributing the metal through most cells, tissues, and fluid compartments. While little is known about how many proteins obtain or release these ions, there is now considerable experimental evidence suggesting that metal carrier proteins may be responsible for transferring metals to and from some Zn(2+)-dependent proteins, thus serving as a major regulatory factor for them. In this review, the biological roles of Zn(2+) and structures of Zn(2+) binding sites are examined, and experimental evidence demonstrating the direct participation of metal carrier proteins in enzyme regulation is discussed.

The results show that compared to the CK group (without additives), the LR group had a higher dry matter content, while the LP group showed an improvement in fermentation quality. At the same time, the bacterial community in the LR group was also different from that in other groups. The treatments of PP and LC had no significant effects on fermentation quality, but the in vitro gas production was significantly reduced in the treated oat silage. These results could help us to optimize the utilization of forage oat silage in balanced ruminant diets.Bacterial inoculants are considered as a good choice for successful ensiling, playing a key role in improving the silage quality. However, the potential of different bacteria, especially the propionic acid bacteria, in forage oat ensiling is yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation effects of different bacterial additives on the fermentation quality of forage oat silage. Four additives (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum F1, LP;Lacticaseibacillus 0rhamnosus XJJ01, LR;Lacticaseibacillus paracasei XJJ02, LC;and Propionibacterium acidipropionici 1.1161, PP;without additives, CK) were inoculated in forage oat silage, and the fermentation quality and organic compounds were determined after 60 days of ensiling. Notably, LR showed higher dry matter preservation compared to other additives and CK. In addition, LP and LR showed strong lactic acid synthesis capacity, resulting in lower pH compared to other additives and CK. The treatments of PP and LC increased the bacterial diversity in silage, while the bacterial community in the LR group was different from that in other groups. In addition, the PP- and LC-treated oat silage showed significantly lower total in vitro gas production and a lower methane content. These results suggest that LP is more favorable for producing high-quality oat silage than LR, LC, or PP.

DESIGN: An organizational case study with mixed methods evaluation from the first 8 weeks of converting a geriatrics clinic from in-person visits to video and telephone visits. SETTING: Veteran's Health Administration in Northern California Participants Community-dwelling older Veterans receiving care at VA Palo Alto Geriatrics clinic. Veterans had a mean age of 85.7 (SD = 6.8) and 72.1% had cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION: Veterans with face-to-face appointments were converted to video or telephone visits to mitigate exposure to community spread of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-two patient evaluations and 80 clinician feedback evaluations were completed. This provided information on satisfaction, care access during pandemic, and travel and time savings. RESULTS: Of the 62 scheduled appointments, 43 virtual visits (69.4%) were conducted. Twenty-six (60.5%) visits were conducted via video, 17 (39.5%) by telephone. Virtual visits saved patients an average of 118.6 minutes each. Patients and providers had similar, positive perceptions about telehealth to in-person visit comparison, limiting exposure, and visit satisfaction. After the telehealth appointment, patients indicated greater comfort with using virtual visits in the future. Thirty-one evaluations included comments for qualitative analysis. We identified 3 main themes of technology set-up and usability, satisfaction with visit, and clinical assessment and communication. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic that has limited the ability to safely conduct inperson services, virtual formats offer a feasible and acceptable alternative for clinically-complex older patients. Despite potential barriers and additional effort required for telehealth visits, patients expressed willingness to utilize this format. Patients and providers reported high satisfaction, particularly with the ability to access care similar to in-person while staying safe.

We want to discuss the relationship between the urban living environment and the number of confirmed cases at the community scale, and examine the driving forces of community infection (e.g., environment, ecology, convenience, livability, and population density). Besides, we hope that our research will help make our cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. 650 communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan were selected as the research objects. We utilize deep learning semantic segmentation technology to calculate the Visible Green Index (VGI) and Sky View Factor (SVF) of street view and use Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to study the driving forces of pandemic situation. Temperature and humidity information recorded by sensors was also used for urban sensing. We find that the more SVF has a certain inhibitory effect on the virus transmission, but contrary to our intuitive perception, higher VGI has a certain promotion effect. Also, the structural equation model constructed in this paper can explain the variance of 28.9% of the number of confirmed cases, and results (path coef.) demonstrate that residential density of community (0.517) is a major influencing factor for pandemic cases, whereas convenience of community living (0.234) strongly influence it. Communities with good suitability of community human settlement (e.g., construction time, price) are safer in the face of pandemic events. Does the influence of SVF and VGI on the results of the pandemic situation mean that sunlight can effectively block the spread of the virus? This spatial heterogeneity in different communities is helpful for us to explore the environmental transmission route of COVID-19. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Multi-source sensor based urban habitat and resident health sensing: A case study of Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 pandemic is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It is an infectious disease and has led to the ongoing global pandemic. This pandemic has also started in Assam, with its first case reported on 31 March, 2020. A prospective study was conducted on 2000 laboratory confirmed coronavirus cases. Proper history were taken and clinical examinations were performed. They were also advised to do the necessary blood investigations, electrocardiogram and chest X- rays. Olfactory functions were assessed using substances like scented soap, mint toothpaste, vicks vaporub, etc. Gustatory functions were also assessed. In our study, we found that 83% (1650) patients presented with otorhinolaryngological or ENT (Ear, nose, throat) manifestations and 17% (350) did not have any otorhinolaryngological manifestations. The most common ENT symptoms with which the patients presented were sore throat (80%) and headache (76%). The other ENT symptoms were hyposmia (44%), dysgeusia (32%) and nasal congestion (28%). The most common non-ENT symptoms were fever (92%) and cough (85%). The other non-ENT symptoms with which the patient presented were malaise, generalized bodyache and abdominal symptoms (like diarrhea). This prospective study gives a view of the incidence of otorhinolaryngological manifestations in COVID 19 patients. But, no significant co-relation was seen between presence of ENT symptoms and the severity of the disease. However, further studies are required to know the pathogenesis of causing ENT symptoms properly and also for definitive treatment of these symptoms.","output":"Otorhinolaryngological Manifestations and Its Management in COVID 19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) corona virus (CoV) infections are a serious public health threat because of their pandemic-causing potential. This work is the first to analyze mRNA expression data from SARS infections through meta-analysis of gene signatures, possibly identifying therapeutic targets associated with major SARS infections. METHODS: This work defines 37 gene signatures representing SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections in human lung cultures and/or mouse lung cultures or samples and compares them through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). To do this, positive and negative infectious clone SARS (icSARS) gene panels are defined from GSEA-identified leading-edge genes between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, both from human cultures. GSEA then is used to assess enrichment and identify leading-edge icSARS panel genes between icSARS gene panels and 27 other SARS-CoV gene signatures. The meta-analysis is expanded to include five MERS-CoV and three SARS-CoV2 gene signatures. Genes associated with SARS infection are predicted by examining the intersecting membership of GSEA-identified leading-edges across gene signatures. RESULTS: Significant enrichment (GSEA p<0.001) is observed between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, and those leading-edge genes defined the positive (233 genes) and negative (114 genes) icSARS panels. Non-random significant enrichment (null distribution p<0.001) is observed between icSARS panels and all verification icSARSvsmock signatures derived from human cultures, from which 51 over- and 22 under-expressed genes are shared across leading-edges with 10 over-expressed genes already associated with icSARS infection. For the icSARSvsmock mouse signature, significant, non-random significant enrichment held for only the positive icSARS panel, from which nine genes are shared with icSARS infection in human cultures. Considering other SARS strains, significant, non-random enrichment (p<0.05) is observed across signatures derived from other SARS strains for the positive icSARS panel. Five positive icSARS panel genes, CXCL10, OAS3, OASL, IFIT3, and XAF1, are found across mice and human signatures regardless of SARS strains. CONCLUSION: The GSEA-based meta-analysis approach used here identifies genes with and without reported associations with SARS-CoV infections, highlighting this approachs predictability and usefulness in identifying genes that have potential as therapeutic targets to preclude or overcome SARS infections.","output":"Gene Expression Meta-Analysis Reveals Interferon-Induced Genes Associated With SARS Infection in Lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This is the first reported case of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type 1/2.

Our study has focused to determine the relationship between C-Reactive protein/Albumin ratio (CAR) and Lactate/Albumin ratio (LAR) and Intensive care unit stay, the requirement for vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support, recovery and mortality in the patients admitted to critical care unit. MATERIAL The study group comprised of 100 patients who were admitted to critical care unit. These patients were evaluated using a structured proforma, detailed case history and clinical examination. Blood sample collection was done after obtaining valid consent from the subjects immediately after admission and serum Albumin, Lactate and C- reactive protein levels were estimated in these patients. OBSERVATION The mean age of the patients in our study was 54.05.Out of the total patients admitted 74% of the patients were males. The common diagnosis was COVID bronchopneumonia (12%). 75% cases were seen having Glasgow Coma scale 15. 88% cases required FIO2 less than 50%. Based on Youden's index, LAR of 0.84 is the ideal cut off with 76.9% sensitivity and 83.8% specificity. Similarly for CAR, the ideal cut off is 88.2 with 84.6% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity. LAR and CAR values greater than 0.84 and 88.2 respectively were considered to be higher values. The patients with high LAR and high CAR values either had increased risk of mortality or increased duration of stay in the hospital (p=0.0001). Patients with low Albumin level and high CRP required Ventilator support which was statistically significant. Patients who needed inotropic support and mechanical ventilator support had higher CAR (P=0.001). Patients who received inotrope support had higher ESR and CRP levels. CONCLUSION CAR and LAR are better indicators of mortality and duration of stay in the intensive care unit as the patients with higher values of these ratios were found to have increased risk of mortality. However CAR was found to be a better indicator of mortality than LAR and it was also noted that the patients who required inotropes and mechanical ventilator support were found to have higher CAR.","output":"Assessing the Prognostic Value of Crp/Albumin Ratio and Lactate/Albumin Ratio in Critically Ill Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Mealtime engagement is defined as verbal and nonverbal assistance provided by caregivers to guide and motivate care-recipients in eating. Quality mealtime engagement is critical to improve mealtime difficulties and intake among older adults with dementia requiring eating assistance. Few tools are feasible and valid to measure mealtime engagement. This study developed and tested the Mealtime Engagement Scale (MES). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Items were developed based on literature review and expert review and finalized based on content validity and corrected item-total correlation. A secondary analysis of 87 videotaped observations capturing 18 nursing home staff providing mealtime care to residents with dementia was conducted. Internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and intra-rater reliability were assessed. Concurrent and convergent validity were examined through correlation (rs) with the Relational Behavior Scale (RBS) and the Mealtime Relational-Care Checklist (M-RCC), respectively. RESULTS The 18-item MES was developed with adequate content validity (Scale-CVI=1.00; Scale-CVI/Average=0.962-0.987). Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 3 (always). The total scale score ranges from 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate greater mealtime engagement. The MES had very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.837), outstanding inter-rater reliability (Interclass Correlation=0.920), outstanding intra-rater reliability (Interclass Correlation =0.956), adequate concurrent validity based on strong correlation with the RBS (rs=0.821, p&.001), and fair convergent validity based on weak correlation with the M-RCC (rs=0.219, p=.042).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 15-item questionnaire was developed following the study goals by a team experienced in allergic rhinitis. Then the records of patients who underwent allergy tests in our hospital between 2013 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Fifty participants with isolated pollen allergy were included in the study. Patients who agreed to participate in the research answered the questions over the phone. RESULTS: Of the 50 participants, 30 (60%) were female and 20 (40%) were male, with a mean age of 34.34  9.41 years. While the rate of participants who defined their nasal symptoms as severe-moderate in the pre-pandemic period was 92% (46 patients), this rate decreased to 56% (28 patients) during the pandemic when they used face masks. In ocular symptoms, the same rate decreased from 60% (30 patients) to 32% (16 patients). A statistically significant decrease was found in both nasal and ocular symptoms of patients after mask use (p < 0.001). The most regression in allergy symptoms was observed in sneezing (p = 0.029) and nasal discharge (p = 0.039).

Large variation in policies regarding parental permission to use technology across sites was reported. Restrictive use of technology in the NICU was reported as a source of stress for families, with parents reporting privacy concerns, overstimulation, and infection control as primary institutional reasons for restriction. While families felt that technology helped them feel close to their infant when they could not be in the NICU, it did not replace being in-person.Conclusion: Large variation in policies regarding parental permission to use technology was reported across Canadian NICUs. Despite legitimate concerns about devices in NICUs, good evidence on how to mitigate these concerns exists.

For example, in heavy rain, face images captured by CCTV from a distance have significant deterioration in both visibility and resolution. Unlike traditional image degradation models (IDM), such as rain removal and superresolution, this study addresses a new IDM referred to as a scale-aware heavy rain model and proposes a method for restoring high-resolution face images (HR-FIs) from low-resolution heavy rain face images (LRHR-FI). To this end, a 2-stage network is presented. The first stage generates low-resolution face images (LR-FIs), from which heavy rain has been removed from the LRHR-FIs to improve visibility. To realize this, an interpretable IDM-based network is constructed to predict physical parameters, such as rain streaks, transmission maps, and atmospheric light. In addition, the image reconstruction loss is evaluated to enhance the estimates of the physical parameters. For the second stage, which aims to reconstruct the HR-FIs from the LR-FIs outputted in the first stage, facial component guided adversarial learning (FCGAL) is applied to boost facial structure expressions. To focus on informative facial features and reinforce the authenticity of facial components, such as the eyes and nose, a face-parsing-guided generator and facial local discriminators are designed for FCGAL. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach based on physical-based network design and FCGAL can remove heavy rain and increase the resolution and visibility simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed heavy-rain face image restoration outperforms state-of-the-art models of heavy rain removal, image-to-image translation, and superresolution.","output":"Heavy Rain Face Image Restoration: Integrating Physical Degradation Model and Facial Component Guided Adversarial Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, the COVID-19 virus has spread to various parts of the world including Indonesia This global pandemic becomes a lethal outbreak since there is no vaccine to treat or prevent transmission of the virus Rapid Test is selected as an essential method to detect Covid-19 in Indonesia because the price is fairly cheap compared to the SWAB test The increase in Covid-19 patients tends to lead to limited capacity for the Covid-19 test available at the hospital so that the latest technology to detect and overcome this pandemic issue is needed Thus, the present research aims to examine the total of 100 X-Ray chest images of the Covid-19 patients and 100 X-ray normal chest images The application of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) methods are implemented to analyze the dataset with two scenarios in obtaining the detection results The results of this research reveal that the application of CLAHE is likely to affect Covid-19 detection accuracy using CNN Also, the application of the CNN basic model shows significant results compared to the application of VGG16 transfer learning ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Detection of COVID-19 in Chest X-ray Image using CLAHE and Convolutional Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Mental health problems are among the leading causes of health-related disability among children and adolescents worldwide. However, there is still a global challenge in terms of gathering consistent epidemiological information about the issue. The present study was designed to describe various mental health issues and factors associated with negative feelings among adolescents in Greater London. Methods: This is a cross sectional study, using a self-administered questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha = 0.742). A convenience sampling strategy was used to recruit participants who were school/college-attending adolescents, aged 11C19. A minimum sample size of 199 was required (95% confidence interval, 5% margin of error, and 15.3% population proportion). The study was conducted between February and April 2016 in Greater London. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics including chi square, Spearman correlation, and binary logistic regression were used to identify the key findings. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v21. Results: A total of 526 out of 1,920 surveys were collected across 18 secondary schools and two colleges, giving a response rate of 27.4%. More than half of the adolescents reported to be either neutral (41.4%), sad (7.8%), or very sad (2.8%), whereas 48% reported to be either happy (35%) or very happy (13%). Difficulties in relationships and hectic schedules were among the most stressful situations affecting adolescents' mental health. Discrimination was identified as the main predicting factor with five-fold increase in odds of having negative mental health symptomatology. Other significant risk factors identified were age, gender, smoking, and health comorbidities. Conclusion: Discrimination was identified as the most predictive factor influencing negative symptomatology among the study cohort. The study had several limitations, most notably the use of a non-validated surrogate measure for mental health, in addition to the exclusion of adolescents aged 10C11 years, school/college dropouts and non-school-going adolescents. A similar study on a national scale is highly recommended to determine the real magnitude of the problem, which would be the starting point toward proper tackling of mental health issues and associated complexities among the adolescent population across England.","output":"Mental Health Among School-Going Adolescents in Greater London: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious pandemic worldwide. However, only few studies focused on risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection among patients with COVID-19.

By multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis, we further determined the associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and potential risk factors. All patients had two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests with 33 days of median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (interquartile range: 25.2-39 days).

Here, we present the final report of the pilot trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of low-dose whole-lung irradiation (LD-WLI) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods and Materials: We enrolled patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia who were older than 60 years. Participants were treated with LD-WLI in a single fraction of 0.5 or 1.0Gy along with the national protocol of COVID-19. The primary endpoints were improvement of SpO2, the number of hospital/ICU stay days, and the number of intubations after RT and the secondary endpoints were alterations of the c-reactive peptide, interleukin-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, and D-dimer. The response rate (RR) was defined as a rise in SpO2 upon RT with rising or constant trend in the next two days, and clinical recovery (CR) included patients who were discharged from the hospital or acquired SpO2 93% on room air. Results: Between 21 May 2020 and 2 July 2020, ten patients were enrolled. The median age was 75 years, 80% were male, and 80% had comorbidities. The first five patients received a single 0.5Gy-WLI, and others received 1.0Gy. Patients were followed for 2-14 days (median 5.5 days). Following one day, nine patients experienced an improvement in SpO2. Five patients were discharged (median 6th day, range 2nd-14th day), and four patients died (median 7th day, range 3rd-10th day). Overall, the RR and CR were 60.0% and 55.5%, respectively. The RR and CR rates of 0.5- and 1.0Gy group were 80% vs 40% and 75% vs 40%, respectively. No acute radiation-induced toxicity was recorded.

METHODS: A total of 1297 patients, admitted between 18 March and 8 April 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions. RESULTS: Anosmia/hyposmia (p<0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), body pain (p<0.0001) and chills (p=0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples.

However, the term aerosol covers most particle sizes of suspended particulates because of information asymmetry in different disciplines, which may lead to misunderstandings in the selection of epidemic prevention and control strategies for the public. In this review, the time when these droplets are exhaled by a patient was taken as the initial time. Then, all available viral loads and numerical distribution of the exhaled droplets was analyzed, and the evaporation model of droplets in the air was combined with the deposition model of droplet nuclei in the respiratory tract. Lastly, the perspective that physical spread affects the transmission risk of different size droplets at different times was summarized for the first time. The results showed that although the distribution of exhaled droplets was dominated by small droplets, droplet volume was proportional to the third power of particle diameter, meaning that the viral load of a 100 m droplet was approximately 10(6) times that of a 1 m droplet at the initial time. Furthermore, the exhaled droplets are affected by heat and mass transfer of evaporation, water fraction, salt concentration, and acid-base balance (the water fraction > 98%), which lead them to change rapidly, and the viral survival condition also deteriorates dramatically. The time required for the initial diameter (d(o)) of a droplet to shrink to the equilibrium diameter (d(e), about 30% of d(o)) is approximately proportional to the second power of the particle diameter, taking only a few milliseconds for a 1 m droplet but hundreds of milliseconds for a 10 m droplet; in other words, the viruses carried by the large droplets can be preserved as much as possible. Finally, the infectious droplet nuclei maybe inhaled by the susceptible population through different and random contact routes, and the droplet nuclei with larger d(e) decompose more easily into tiny particles on account of the accelerated collision in a complex airway, which can be deposited in the higher risk alveolar region. During disease transmission, the infectious droplet particle size varies widely, and the transmission risk varies significantly at different time nodes; therefore, the fuzzy term aerosol is not conducive to analyzing disease exposure risk. Recommendations for epidemic prevention and control strategies are: 1) Large droplets are the main conflict in disease transmission; thus, even if they are blocked by a homemade mask initially, it significantly contains the epidemic. 2) The early phase of contact, such as close-contact and short-range transmission, has the highest infection risk; therefore, social distancing can effectively keep the susceptible population from inhaling active viruses. 3) The risk of the fomite route depends on the time in contact with infectious viruses; thus, it is important to promote good health habits (including frequent hand washing, no-eye rubbing, coughing etiquette, normalization of surface cleaning), although blind and excessive disinfection measures are not advisable. 4) Compared with the large droplets, the small droplets have larger numbers but carry fewer viruses and are more prone to die through evaporation.","output":"Transmission risk of infectious droplets in physical spreading process at different times: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 13, 2020, the first cases of SARS-COVID19 were detected in Uruguay.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate intestinal colonisation with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant pathogens following use of temocillin-an alternative antibiotic to cefotaxime that is potentially less prone to disturbing the intestinal microbiota-in empirical treatment of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: We did a randomised, multicentre, superiority, open-label phase 4 trial in patients who had been admitted to inpatient care in 12 Swedish hospitals with suspected or diagnosed febrile UTI (complicated or uncomplicated). To meet inclusion criteria, a patient was required to have at least one sign or symptom of pyelonephritis (ie, flank pain; costovertebral angle tenderness; and changes to urinary frequency or urgency or dysuria), a fever of 380C or higher, and a positive urine dipstick (for nitrites, white blood cells, or both). Participants were also required to have an indication for intravenous antibiotic treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 2 g temocillin or 1-2 g cefotaxime, by local investigators opening consecutive sealed randomisation envelopes that were generated centrally in advance. Both drugs were administered intravenously every 8 h. The trial was open label for investigators and patients, but those doing the microbiological analyses were masked to the groups. Participants were treated with antibiotics for 7-10 days (or up to 14 days if they had bacteraemia), at least 3 days of which were on the study drug; at day 4 and later, participants who were showing improvement could be given an oral antibiotic (ciprofloxacin, ceftibuten, cefixime, or co-trimoxazole). Patients not showing improvement were regarded as having treatment failures. Rectal swabs were collected at three timepoints: at baseline (before the first dose), after the last dose of study drug, and 7-10 days after treatment stopped. The composite primary outcome was colonisation with Enterobacterales with reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, or colonisation with toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile, or both, to evaluate disturbance of the intestinal microbiota. The study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2015-003898-15). FINDINGS: Between May 20, 2016, and July 31, 2019, 207 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 55 patients were excluded. 152 participants were randomly assigned to groups: 77 (51%) patients received temocillin, 75 (49%) patients received cefotaxime. The composite primary endpoint was met by 18 (26%) of 68 participants receiving temocillin versus 30 (48%) of 62 patients receiving cefotaxime (risk difference -22% [95% CI -42% to -3%]), showing superiority of temocillin versus cefotaxime (ie, less disturbance of the intestinal microbiota). 43 adverse events were reported in 40 (52%) of 77 patients in the temocillin group, versus 46 adverse events in 34 (45%) of 75 patients in the cefotaxime group. Most events were of mild to moderate severity. 21 (27%) patients in the temocillin and 17 (23%) patients in the cefotaxime group had an adverse event that was considered to be associated with the study drug. INTERPRETATION: Temocillin was found to be less selective than cefotaxime of Enterobacterales with reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, and it could therefore be a favourable alternative in the empirical treatment of febrile UTI. Use of this antibiotic could reduce hospital transmission and health-care-associated infections by these pathogens.

Morbidity patterns of COVIDC19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVIDC19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted.

Considering that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may be an opportunity for university students to take greater responsibility for their learning, it is essential to explore the strategies they have developed in the face of emotional and learning challenges during the health crisis. This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between students' emotions, coping strategies, and self-regulated learning in online learning during COVID-19 home confinement. The participants were 1,290 Mexican students from different universities throughout the country, who answered an online self-report questionnaire from standardized instruments adapted to the pandemic. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning. Thus, teachers should help students understand the relevance of active coping strategies and use student-centered learning models that promote autonomous and self-regulated learning, considering each learner's needs, during and after confinement.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Home Confinement on Mexican University Students: Emotions, Coping Strategies, and Self-Regulated Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digitally mediated touch is an emerging and significant area for technology and therefore for design and design education.

PURPOSE: To assess 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP in the U.S. METHODS: Data from the 2009C2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) influenza supplemental survey were analyzed in 2011. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models were performed to identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure was used to estimate the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated. RESULTS: Among 16,975 HCP surveyed, 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1% (95% CI=32.7%, 35.5%); 52.4% (95% CI=50.9%, 53.9%); and 58.0% (95% CI=56.5%, 59.5%), respectively, all of which were significantly higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively).

This study examined the clinical and selected genetic factors associated with NODAT among renal-transplanted Malaysian patients. METHODS This study included 168 non-diabetic patients (58% males, 69% of Chinese ethnicity) who received renal transplantation between 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2014, and were followed up in two major renal transplant centres in Malaysia. Fasting blood glucose levels were used to diagnose NODAT in patients who received renal transplantation within 1 year. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely; rs1494558 (interleukin-7 receptor, IL-7R) and rs2232365 (mannose-binding leptin-2, MBL2) were selected and genotyped using Sequenom MassArray platform. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine the risk of developing NODAT according to the different demographics and clinical covariates, utilizing four time-points (one-month, three-months, six-months, one-year) post-transplant. RESULTS Seventeen per cent of patients (n = 29, 55% males, 69% Chinese) were found to have developed NODAT within one-year of renal transplantation based on their fasting blood glucose levels. NODAT patients had renal transplantation at an older age compared to non-NODAT (39.3  13.4 vs 33.9  11.8 years, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, renal-transplanted patients who received a higher daily dose of cyclosporine (mg) were associated with increased risk of NODAT (Hazard ratio (HR) =1.01 per mg increase in dose, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.01, p = 0.002). Other demographic (gender, ethnicities, age at transplant) and clinical factors (primary kidney disease, type of donor, place of transplant, type of calcineurin inhibitors, duration of dialysis pre-transplant, BMI, creatinine levels, and daily doses of tacrolimus and prednisolone) were not found to be significantly associated with risk of NODAT. GA genotype of rs1494558 (HR = 3.15 95% CI 1.26, 7.86) and AG genotype of rs2232365 (HR = 2.57 95% CI 1.07, 6.18) were associated with increased risk of NODAT as compared to AA genotypes. CONCLUSION The daily dose of cyclosporine and SNPs of IL-7R (rs1494558) and MBL2 (rs2232365) genes are significantly associated with the development of NODAT in the Malaysian renal transplant population.","output":"Clinical and genetic risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) in major transplant centres in Malaysia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although young adults are not at great risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19, their willingness to get vaccinated affects the whole community. Vaccine hesitancy has increased during recent years, and more research is needed on its situational determinants. This paper reports a preregistered experiment (N = 654) that examined whether communicating descriptive social norms C information about what most people do C is an effective way of influencing young peoples intentions and reducing their hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found weak support for our main hypothesis that conveying strong (compared to weak) norms leads to reduced hesitancy and stronger intentions. Furthermore, norms did not produce significantly different effects compared to standard vaccine information from the authorities. Moreover, no support was found for the hypothesis that young people are more strongly influenced by norms when the norm reference group consists of other young individuals rather than people in general. These findings suggest that the practical usefulness of signaling descriptive norms is rather limited, and may not be more effective than standard appeals in the quest of encouraging young adults to trust and accept a new vaccine.","output":"Do social norms influence young peoples willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to develop a 3-dimensional (3D) printing method to create computed tomography (CT) realistic phantoms of lung cancer nodules and lung parenchymal disease from clinical CT images. MATERIALS AND METHODS Low-density paper was used as substrate material for inkjet printing with potassium iodide solution to reproduce phantoms that mimic the CT attenuation of lung parenchyma. The relationship between grayscale values and the corresponding CT numbers of prints was first established through the derivation of exponential fitted equation from scanning data. Next, chest CTs from patients with early-stage lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were chosen for 3D printing. CT images of original lung nodule and the 3D-printed nodule phantom were compared based on pixel-to-pixel correlation and radiomic features. RESULTS CT images of part-solid lung cancer and 3D-printed nodule phantom showed both high visual similarity and quantitative correlation. R2 values from linear regressions of pixel-to-pixel correlations between 5 sets of patient and 3D-printed image pairs were 0.92, 0.94, 0.86, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Comparison of radiomic measures between clinical CT and printed models demonstrated 6.1% median difference, with 25th and 75th percentile range at 2.4% and 15.2% absolute difference, respectively. The densities and parenchymal morphologies from COVID-19 pneumonia CT images were well reproduced in the 3D-printed phantom scans.

As more antibiotics become ineffective due to drug-resistant bacteria, attention must be directed toward alternative treatments for calf diarrhea. Natural antibiotic alternatives, such as Chinese herbal medicine, have become a research hotspot in the clinical treatment of diseases such as calf diarrhea due to their characteristics of fewer side effects, low cost, little residue, and no drug resistance. The Cangpu Oral Liquid (CP) was modified from a traditional herbal formula that had been widely used in ancient China to treat gastrointestinal diseases in animals. In order to evaluate the treatment effect of CP on neonatal calf diarrhea, a randomized controlled field trial was performed. Two hundred and forty-six diarrheal Holstein calves of 2C15 days old were selected and randomly divided into two treatment groups receiving either apramycin or CP. 101 out of 123 calves recovered from diarrhea in the CP group, whereas 77 out of 123 calves showed recovery after antibiotic therapy. There were no differences in initial weight between both groups, while the final weight was significantly different (P = 0.892, P = 0.025, respectively). The mean average daily gain (ADG) of calves (211.45 gram/day) in the CP group was significantly higher compared to the antibiotic group (164.56 gram/day) (P = 0.001). The CP group also showed a shorter recovery time from diarrhea (3.90 days vs. 6.62 days, P = 0.001).

Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19. RESULTS The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership. INTERPRETATION For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","output":"For-profit long-term care homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biliary endoprosthesis plays a crucial role in the management of patients with obstructive jaundice.

This study investigates the clinical knowledge of healthcare workers about COVID-19, their ways of acquiring information, their emotional distress and risk perception, their adherence to preventive guidelines, their changed work situation due to the pandemic, and their perception of how the healthcare system has coped with the pandemic. It is based on a quantitative cross-sectional survey of 185 Swiss healthcare workers directly attending to patients during the pandemic, with 22% (n = 40) of them being assigned to COVID-19-infected patients. The participants answered between 16th June and 15th July 2020, shortly after the first wave of COVID-19 had been overcome and the national government had relaxed its preventive regulations to a great extent. The questionnaire incorporated parts of the Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak (version 2015), which were adapted to the case of COVID-19. Clinical knowledge was lowest regarding the effectiveness of standard hygiene (p < 0.05). Knowledge of infectiousness, incubation time, and life-threatening disease progression was higher, however still significantly lower than regarding asymptomatic cases and transmission without physical contact (p < 0.001). 70% (95%-confidence interval: 64-77%) of the healthcare workers reported considerable emotional distress on at least one of the measured dimensions. They worried significantly more strongly about patients, elderly people, and family members, than about their own health (p < 0.001). Adherence to (not legally binding) preventive guidelines by the government displayed patterns such that not all guidelines were followed equally. Most of the participants were faced with a lack of protective materials, personnel, structures, processes, and contingency plans. An increase in stress level was the most prevalent among the diverse effects the pandemic had on their work situation. Better medical equipment (including drugs), better protection for their own mental and physical health, more (assigned) personnel, more comprehensive information about the symptoms of the disease, and a system of earlier warning were the primary lessons to be learned in view of upcoming waves of the pandemic.","output":"Lessons From the First Wave of COVID-19: Work-Related Consequences, Clinical Knowledge, Emotional Distress, and Safety-Conscious Behavior in Healthcare Workers in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability.

Their symptoms could be mild, with cold sores up to 10 days of infection, blindness and encephalitis caused by HSV-1 affecting immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals. The severe effects derive from co-evolution with the host, resulting in immune evasion mechanisms, including latency and growing resistance to acyclovir and derivatives. An efficient alternative to controlling the spreading of HSV mutations is the exploitation of new drugs, and the possibility of enhancing their delivery through the encapsulation of drugs into nanoparticles, such as liposomes. In this work, liposomes were loaded with a series of 2-aminomethyl- 3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones derivatives with n-butyl (compound 1), benzyl (compound 2) and nitrobenzene (compound 3) substituents in the primary amine of naphthoquinone. They were previously identified to have significant inhibitory activity against HSV-1. All of the aminomethylnaphthoquinones derivatives encapsulated in the phosphatidylcholine liposomes were able to control the early and late phases of HSV-1 replication, especially those substituted with the benzyl (compound 2) and nitrobenzene (compound 3), which yields selective index values that are almost nine times more efficient than acyclovir.

This includes significant central nervous system (CNS) involvement that ranges from acute delirium to meningoencephalitis. While acute symptoms and manifestations have been noted, long-term neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes remain unclear in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Characterizing the convalescence is particularly important since 80% recover, yet the relationship between exacerbated cognitive dysfunction and COVID-19 remains unclear. We describe 3 adults above age 65 who reported worsening cognitive symptoms in the convalescent stage of COVID-19. Methods Three adults above the age of 65 who noted worsening cognitive difficulties after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 were evaluated in the Memory Clinic of the Duke Neurological Disorders Clinic. Electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Exam included a comprehensive neurological evaluation, formal neuropsychological evaluation, and neuroimaging. Prior history was collected for comparison with their current clinical evaluation profile data. Results Patient 1 is a 69 year old diabetic, hypertensive male with a history of depression and a first-order relative and a maternal aunt with late-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia who presented for evaluation of memory loss first noted about one year prior but had significantly worsened in the five months since his recovery from COVID-19. He had documented antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The patient reported forgetting when he had eaten and now evinces navigation issues even when driving on familiar roads. Head CT without contrast obtained before COVID-19 infection showed mild bilateral hippocampal atrophy. He scored 4/8 on the AD8 Dementia Screening and 20/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). PHQ9 was 10, GAD7 was 0, and NPI was 1. Formal neuropsychological evaluation data were collected. A diagnosis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease without behavioral disturbance was made during his clinic visit. Donezepil was started. Other comorbidities included vitamin B12 deficiency, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. Patient 2 is a 68 year old male with a history of anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorder who presented for evaluation of poor memory, inability to visually map, and daily senior moments as well as a prolonged period of confusion while driving four months after recovering from COVID-19. He had documented antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. He had transient memory problems two years ago that improved after changing his bupropion dosage. He also takes fluoxetine. He now regularly misplaces objects and often stops a task midway through, thinking that he completed it. His GDS score was 5. Head CT was unremarkable. MRI of the brain demonstrated mild hippocampal and biparietal lobe atrophy as well as mild cerebral white matter disease. He scored 7/8 on the AD8 Dementia Screening and 27/30 on the MoCA. A diagnosis of dementia with behavioral disturbance was made. PHQ9 was 9, GAD7 was 6, and NPI was 7. B12 was normal. There is no family history of cognitive impairment. Patient 3 is a 76-year-old female with a history of bipolar 1, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who presented for evaluation of memory loss that started 6 months ago but worsened since she had recovered from COVID-19 diagnosed about 8 weeks earlier. After testing positive, she was hospitalized for 3 weeks due to acute encephalopathy attributed to lithium toxicity. She was also taking trazodone. Her GDS score was 7. She scored 8/8 on the AD8 Dementia Screening. MoCA could not be completed. PHQ9 was 3, GAD7 was 9, and NPI was 19. Formal neuropsychological evaluation data were collected. Head CT without contrast three weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis showed calcification in the right basal ganglia, a mild hypodense signal periventricularly, and gray-white differentiation. Brain MRI without contrast showed subtle hippocampal and perisylvian atrophy on T1, mild to moderate parietal lobe atrophy bilaterally, and mild to moderate periventricular leukoaraiosis/white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR sequence. A diagnosis of dementia without behavioral disturbance was made. There is a family history of bipolar disorder in siblings and cognitive impairment in her father but no specific diagnosis of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, CE-certified FFP2 respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured. METHOD: A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards was developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators.

However, evidence on the safety and efficacy of these therapies is limited. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-group, controlled trial involving hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 who were receiving either no supplemental oxygen or a maximum of 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard care, standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, or standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily plus azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg once daily for 7 days. The primary outcome was clinical status at 15 days as assessed with the use of a seven-level ordinal scale (with levels ranging from one to seven and higher scores indicating a worse condition) in the modified intention-to-treat population (patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19). Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 667 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients had confirmed Covid-19 and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. As compared with standard care, the proportional odds of having a higher score on the seven-point ordinal scale at 15 days was not affected by either hydroxychloroquine alone (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 2.11; P=1.00) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.73; P=1.00).

The purpose of this systematic review was to determine which indications for DC have evidence that they are reliable and/or valid (and therefore in which clinical situations evidence supports use of DC or that DC improves outcomes). METHODS: We searched 11 databases (1950CApril 1, 2019) for studies that enrolled exclusively civilian trauma patients and reported data on the reliability (consistency of surgical decisions in a given clinical scenario) or content (surgeons would perform DC in that clinical scenario or the indication predicted use of DC in practice), construct (were associated with poor outcomes), or criterion (were associated with improved outcomes when DC was conducted instead of definitive surgery) validity for suggested indications for DC surgery or DC interventions. RESULTS: Among 34,979 citations identified, we included 36 cohort studies and three cross-sectional surveys in the systematic review. Of the 59 unique indications for DC identified, 10 had evidence of content validity [e.g., a major abdominal vascular injury or a packed red blood cell (PRBC) volume exceeding the critical administration threshold], nine had evidence of construct validity (e.g., unstable patients with combined abdominal vascular and pancreas gunshot injuries or an iliac vessel injury and intraoperative acidosis), and six had evidence of criterion validity (e.g., penetrating trauma patients requiring > 10 U PRBCs with an abdominal vascular and multiple abdominal visceral injuries or intraoperative hypothermia, acidosis, or coagulopathy). No studies evaluated the reliability of indications. CONCLUSIONS: Few indications for DC surgery or DC interventions have evidence supporting that they are reliable and/or valid. DC should be used with respect for the uncertainty regarding its effectiveness, and only in circumstances where definitive surgery cannot be entertained.

The virus is an enveloped RNA virus, transmitted directly or indirectly via airborne route or contact with contaminated fomites. Studies have shown that transmission occurs rapidly among humans because of poor health C related behaviour frequently exhibited. Although, necessary information on COVID-19 is accessible on all media platforms, the consistent poor response to safety guidelines by individuals at home, public settings and workplaces has aided the prolonged duration of the pandemic. In addition, it has been reported that individuals can be reorientated to behave appropriately via specialized and structured programs. Hence, I hereby propose the use of health C related behaviour change (HRBC) program for control of COVID-19 at workplaces. Materials and Methods: The HRBC program for control of COVID-19 at workplaces requires strict adherence to the following measures: development, implementation, and enforcement of workplace policy for COVID-19;workshops;penalty and reward system;workers engagement via whistleblowing;use of educative videos in eating areas;COVID-19 safety tips in daily toolbox talks;and quarterly performance review.

Design: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research Data sources: Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched. The search was not limited to peer-reviewed published data, but also included pre-print articles. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and confidence intervals of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. The majority of studies suitable for inclusion in the final analysis modelled incubation period as a lognormal distribution. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the parameters of this distribution. Results: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55) respectively. The corresponding mean was 5.8 (5.01, 6.69 days). It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (4.5, 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.6 (9.5, 14.2) days. Conclusions and implications: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of a nosocomial adenovirus outbreak in an ICU. METHODS: We evaluated all the patients treated and the medical staff working in the ICU from August 1 to September 4, 2019. We further performed an epidemiological and molecular analysis for this outbreak from patient to healthcare workers and between healthcare workers. After the outbreak, we adopted exposure prevention and droplet prevention measures based on standard precautions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between August 1 and August 27, 2019, 27 cases of human adenovirus cross-infection were reported in our institution. Among the cases, eleven were doctors (41%), eleven were nurses (41%), three were respiratory therapists (11%), and two were caregivers (7%). The attack rate was 28.4%, and the fatality rate was 0. The results showed that contact with the index case, lack of hand hygiene or gloving adherence were risk factors for infection after adenovirus exposure. After taking specific precautions, no new cases of infection have appeared since August 27. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that HAdV55 in a single patient had strong transmission potential in an intensive care unit with adequate facilities and standardized operation.

In this study, we describe a simple technique to quantify this pathology via sonography. METHODS: Thirty-six shoulders from 18 patients with ac joint instabilities were examined using modified Alexander views and a standardized sonographic examination. On the Alexander views, overlap of acromion and clavicle (OLAC), glenoid center to posterior clavicle distance (GCPC), and lateral extension (LE) were measured. Afterwards, the results were analyzed and compared with sonography. Posterior translation of the clavicle and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 39  14 years (range 19-61 years). We included 4 (22%) Rockwood type 3, 1 (6%) Rockwood type 4, and 13 (72%) Rockwood type 5 lesions. Four (22%) patients were female and 14 (78%) male patients. Posterior clavicle translation of the injured shoulder correlated strongly between OLAC and sonography (r = -0.514, P = .029), and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder correlated very strongly between LE and sonography (r = 0.737, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The sonographic measurement technique for horizontal instability presented in this work could help detect horizontal instabilities.

It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infectionparticularly early in the course of infectionwhen using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RTCPCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. RESULTS: Between 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (n = 40) and control (n = 40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (P = 1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RTCPCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (P > 0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

Only a few coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two cause infections similar in severity to SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a species closely related to SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Unlike the current pandemic, previous epidemics were controlled rapidly through public health measures, but the body of research investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome has proven valuable for identifying approaches to treating and preventing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Building on this research, the medical and scientific communities have responded rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and identified many candidate therapeutics. The approaches used to identify candidates fall into four main categories: adaptation of clinical approaches to diseases with related pathologies, adaptation based on virological properties, adaptation based on host response, and data-driven identification (ID) of candidates based on physical properties or on pharmacological compendia. To date, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while most remain under investigation. The scale of the COVID-19 crisis offers a rare opportunity to collect data on the effects of candidate therapeutics. This information provides insight not only into the management of coronavirus diseases but also into the relative success of different approaches to identifying candidate therapeutics against an emerging disease.

With the worldwide scientific community shifting focus onto the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, a large number of possible pharmaceutical approaches for treatment and prevention have been proposed. What was known about each of these potential interventions evolved rapidly throughout 2020 and 2021. This fast-paced area of research provides important insight into how the ongoing pandemic can be managed and also demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to rapidly understand a virus and match its characteristics with existing or novel pharmaceuticals.

While some volcanoes are prone to erupt magmas of a wide compositional variety, others sample rather monotonous chemistries through time. Whether such differences are a consequence of physical filtering or reflect intrinsic properties of different magmatic systems remains unclear. Here we show, using thermal and petrological modelling, that magma flux and the thermal structure of the crust modulate diversity and temporal evolution of magma chemistry in mid to deep crustal reservoirs. Our analysis shows that constant rates of magma input leads to extractable magma compositions that tend to evolve from felsic to more mafic in time. Low magma injection rates into hot or deep crust produces less chemical variability of extractable magma compared to the injection of large batches in colder or shallower crust. Our calculations predict a correlation between magma fluxes and compositional diversity that resembles trends observed in volcanic deposits. Our approach allows retrieval of quantitative information about magma input and the thermal architecture of magmatic systems from the chemical diversity and temporal evolution of volcanic products.","output":"Magma diversity reflects recharge regime and thermal structure of the crust."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are causative agents of respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological infections in mammals and birds The main characteristic of coronaviruses is a high mutation rate, resulting in possible changes in their pathogenicity, tissue tropism or in their host Even though they have been known causes of disease for decades, they became interesting in the 21st century due to outbreaks of large epidemics in humans and causing serious economic losses in the animal production sector, primarily the pig industry The outbreaks of the highest concern emerged in 2002 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -

Under sum of squares (SOS) relaxation, the problem of barrier certificate generation is equivalent to that of solving a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) with a particular type. The paper reveals the special feature of the problem, and adopts it to build a novel computational method. The proposed method introduces a sequential iterative scheme that is able to find analytical solutions, rather than the nonlinear solving procedure to produce numerical solutions used by general BMI solvers and thus is more efficient than them. In addition, different from popular LMI solving based methods, it does not make the verification conditions more conservative, and thus reduces the risk of missing feasible solutions. Benefitting from these two appealing features, it can produce barrier certificates not amenable to existing methods, which is supported by a complexity analysis as well as the experiment on some benchmarks.","output":"A Novel Approach for Solving the BMI Problem in Barrier Certificates Generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series reports the correlation between extravascular lung water (EVLW) and the partial arterial oxygen pressure/fractional inspiratory oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio in three patients with severe influenza A (H1N1)-induced respiratory failure.

It is defined by kidney tissue injury [with or without a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and /or a decrease in kidney function over a period of three or more months. When the glomerular filtration rate [GFR] is below 15ml./min./1.73m2, the patient is in the terminal stage or dialysis, requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT], dialysis or transplant as alternative treatments. Renal failure is the inability of the kidney to excrete wastes, concentrate urine, and conserve electrolytes. Renal failure is precipitated from a variety of etiological factors. It is treatable but not curable, which means that the patient needs a long term therapies or transplantation. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in this study found to be 22.9%, 19.2%, and 28.2%, respectively. Forty nine (13.84%) respondents had mild depression twenty eight (7.91%) has moderate depression. Depression and anxiety are frequent comorbid disorders among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, with estimated prevalence of approximately 25% in this population, [1] and are associated with worse outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality [2,3,4,5]. The transition from predialysis management to renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a stressful event in the course of CKD, leading to challenges and decisions that might increase their susceptibility to anxiety, mood disorders or even exacerbate psychological issues that already exist [6].

Treatments for AD are based on environmental controls, topical and systemic therapies, and allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). However, it remains unclear the effectiveness and adverse events of AIT and all conventional topical treatments compared with placebo and each other for AD. METHODS We will search five electronic databases [Central Cochrane register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS] from inception until November 2019 with no language restriction, and we will include experimental studies [randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and quasi-RCTs]. The primary outcome is global and specific skin symptoms assessment. Secondary outcomes are hospital length of stay, quality of life, and adverse events. Reviewers independently will extract data from the studies that meet our inclusion criteria and will assess the risk of bias of individual primary studies. We will conduct random effects pairwise meta-analyses for the observed pairwise comparisons with at least two trials. Then, we will perform random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to obtain treatment effects for all possible comparisons and to provide a hierarchy of all interventions for each outcome. Possible incoherence between direct and indirect sources of evidence will be investigated locally (if possible) and globally. To investigate sources of statistical heterogeneity, we will perform a series of meta-regression analyses based on pre-specified important effect modifiers.

We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $$ and by increasing the removal rate $$ by a factor of $$. We show that for a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\\\\hat I_P$ number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can be reduced by a factor $1/$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing.

To exclude cases due to prolonged viral shedding or protracted infection, only cases occurring at least 12 weeks apart or confirmed as being sustained by genetically different viruses by viral genome analysis were included. RESULTS: We identified 23 cases globally, for which viral genome analysis was performed in 10 cases and serology in 19 cases. The mean interval between the two episodes was 15 weeks. Mean age of cases was 44.5 years, and 10 (43.5%) were women. In 17/23 cases, no comorbidity was observed. In 10 cases, the first episode was more severe than the ensuing episode, whereas in seven cases the ensuing episode was more severe.

Although the mechanisms responsible for these effects are still largely unknown, a novel line of inquiry in the resilience field conceptualizes positive adaptation, following exposure to atypical adversity, as resulting from complex interactions of systems at multiple ecological levels. The purpose of the present analysis was to apply this multisystemic resilience framework to the study of positive adaptation following exposure to family adversity in a sample of Canadian adolescents (n = 230; mean age 16.16, SD = 1.38) and South African adolescents (n = 421; mean age = 15.97, SD = 1.19) living in economically volatile communities dependent on the oil and gas industry. Cross-sectional survey data were used to investigate the mechanisms through which family adversity exercises its impact on adolescent conduct problems by accounting for their caregiving, peer, and community resources. Results of two moderated mediation analyses showed that family adversity impacts adolescent externalizing mental health negatively, via disrupted caregiving, when other resources are also considered. For the Canadian adolescents, these negative impacts were protectively moderated by peer support, but not moderated by appreciation for community traditions. In contrast, peer support showed no significant protective effect for the South African sample, while a strong appreciation for community traditions was positively and significantly associated with conduct difficulties. Contextual dynamics (e.g., social unrest) provide a plausible explanation for the discrepant results and bring attention to the importance of theorizing resilience in context.","output":"Understanding the Mechanisms through Which Family Risk Affects Adolescent Mental Health: A Model of Multisystemic Resilience in Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based monitoring for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the individual building level could be an efficient, passive means of early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side by side to assess feasibility, performance, and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over 8 weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24-h composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living. IMPORTANCE Some of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious, with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate contagious, newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","output":"Development of Wastewater Pooled Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Congregate Living Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As healthcare systems explore new ways of delivering care for patients with and without COVID-19, they must consider how to maintain physical distancing among healthcare workers and patients.

Several data types can be used to inform transmission network inferences, yet the sensitivity of those inferences to different data types is not routinely evaluated. METHODS: The influence of different combinations of spatial, temporal, and travel-history data on transmission network inferences for Plasmodium falciparum malaria were evaluated. RESULTS: The information content of these data types may be limited for inferring person-to-person transmission networks and may lead to an overestimate of transmission. Only when outbreaks were temporally focal or travel histories were accurate was the algorithm able to accurately estimate the reproduction number under control, R(c). Applying this approach to data from Eswatini indicated that inferences of R(c) and spatiotemporal patterns therein depend upon the choice of data types and assumptions about travel-history data.

Results: Methods provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) server were the most frequently used to predict epitopes. Sequence alignment of the epitopes extracted from literature with the Spike protein demonstrated that the epitopes in different studies converged to multiple short hotspot regions. There were three hotspot regions found in RBD of the Spike protein harboring B-cell linear epitopes ('RQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD', 'SYGFQPTNGVGYQ' and 'YAWNRKRISNCVA') predicted to have high antigenicity score. Two T-cell epitopes ('KPFERDISTEIYQ' and 'NYNYLYRLFR') predicted to be highly antigenic in the original studies were discovered in the hotspot region.

Objective: In this study, severe asthmatic patients on treatment with one of three different biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab) underwent a survey to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the management of their clinical condition, with regard to the changes caused by the limited access to health facilities during the pandemic period. Methods: In this prospective observational study, 28 severe asthmatic outpatients referring to the Respiratory Unit of Magna Graecia University Hospital, Catanzaro (Italy), were asked to answer a telephone survey from May to July 2021. This survey included the evaluation of demographic and clinical data, as well as the number of lung function tests performed, exacerbations, biologic doses administered at hospital, or at general practitioner office, or through self-administration. Adherence to biological therapies before and during the pandemic period was also assessed. Moreover, the most recent asthma control test (ACT) score and the last forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) measurement, recorded during the pandemic phase, were compared to the pre-pandemic (baseline) period. Results: When comparing the pre-pandemic data with the pandemic observations, the mean ACT score and the exacerbation rate did not significantly change [ACT, 21.5 2.8 to 23.0 3.9 (p = 0.1);exacerbation rate, 0.3 0.6 and 0.5 1.5 (p = 0.3)]. When considering some variables related to disease management in the same periods, a statistically significant difference was detected with regard to the mean number of outpatient visits (5.2 3.8 vs. 0.9 2.5, p < 0.0001), as well as to the mean number of accesses to health facilities for the administration of biological drugs (from 7.0 3.4 to 2.5 3.9, p < 0.0001).

Intracorporeal knot tying still remains a technical challenge for the surgeon. Self-anchoring suture incorporates a new concept for tissue approximation and reduces intracorporeal knot tying problems. There are very few reports on self-anchoring knotless suture and its application for laparoscopic pyeloplasty in children. We present our results of a series of consecutive children undergoing laparoscopic pyeloplasty with knotless barbed sutures. MATERIAL AND METHOD We prospectively evaluate 15 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty with knotless barbed sutures (V-LocTM, Covidien) for ureteropelvic anastomosis. The decision of the operation was given by pediatric nephrology-urology-radiologic imaging diagnostic team, and all patients were operated by a single surgeon. Pyeloplasty was performed without pelvic reduction, and the anastomosis was made by barbed sutures using running fashion. RESULTS The mean age of the patients were 5.39 (3 months-17 years). Two cases had undergone a right-sided pyeloplasty, and thirteen had undergone a left-sided pyeloplasty. The duration of the operative procedure was 60-110 min. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complication was encountered in any of the cases. Patients were followed by ultrasonographic evaluation. The anteroposterior diameter (AP) diameter of renal pelvis and hydronephrosis grade Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) are significantly different when compared with pre-operative and postoperative period (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Owing to the renal parenchymal thickness change by age pre-operative and postoperative thickness comparison is adjusted by age, because age is considered as a covariate (confounder variable). We observed statistically significant (p = 0.003) difference in parenchymal thickness in all cases. Follow-up periods of the 15 consecutive pediatric pyeloplasty cases were 6-54 months. CONCLUSION In the present study, successful outcome of the laparoscopic pyeloplasty using barbed suture was shown for the first time in children in literature. We believe that successful outcome of laparoscopic pyeloplasty could be achieved by eliminating knots and less manipulation on the wound edge also minimizes tissue injury during the procedure.","output":"Successful outcomes in laparoscopic pyeloplasty using knotless self-anchoring barbed suture in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide range of neurological manifestations have been associated with the development of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we used state-of-the-art multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n = 6 COVID-19, median age = 69.5 years; n = 7 control, median age = 68 years) and demonstrated that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and ubiquitous in, patients that exhibited moderate to high ACE2 expression in perivascular cells. Viral dsRNA was identified in the vascular wall and paralleled by perivascular inflammation, as signified by T cell and macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, fibrinogen leakage indicated compromised integrity of the bloodCbrain barrier. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid from additional 16 individuals (n = 8 COVID-19, median age = 67 years; n = 8 control, median age = 69.5 years) exhibited significantly lower levels of the pericyte marker PDGFR in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, indicative of disrupted pericyte homeostasis.

We aimed to elucidate whether early intubation is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who required intubation. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted at 66 hospitals in Japan where patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 were treated between January and September 2020. Patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19 with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test and intubated during admission were included. Early intubation was defined as intubation conducted in the setting of  6 L/min of oxygen usage. In-hospital mortality was compared between patients with early and non-early intubation. Inverse probability weighting analyses with propensity scores were performed to adjust patient demographics, comorbidities, hemodynamic status on admission and time at intubation, medications before intubation, severity of COVID-19, and institution characteristics. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of age, severity of hypoxemia at intubation, and days from admission to intubation. RESULTS: Among 412 patients eligible for the study, 110 underwent early intubation. In-hospital mortality was lower in patients with early intubation than those with non-early intubation (18 [16.4%] vs. 88 [29.1%]; odds ratio, 0.48 [95% confidence interval 0.27C0.84]; p = 0.009, and adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95% confidence interval 0.19C0.42]; p < 0.001). The beneficial effects of early intubation were observed regardless of age and severity of hypoxemia at time of intubation; however, early intubation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality only among patients who were intubated later than 2 days after admission.

The current study attempts to investigate the relationships between infection, mortality and recovery rates from coronavirus and the prevalence of ADHD at the US statewide level. Based on information from 2011 regarding the prevalence of ADHD across the US by state, findings suggest that, while there are no correlations between ADHD and population size, infection and mortality rates from coronavirus, recovery rates (recovery-population ratio) rise with the prevalence of ADHD. Consequently, a possible explanation is that in coping with the disease, ADHD might provide an evolutionary advantage. An example of this phenomenon can be found in the gene that causes sickle-cell disease, which, as a non-dominant gene, helps cope with infection from malaria. If corroborated, research findings may support the conclusion that coronavirus limitations in special educational frameworks for ADHD would not be required or could be relaxed.

Drawing on risky decision-making theory and the job demands-resource model of workplace safety, we examined the influences of employees COVID-19 risk perception on their safety performance at work. On the one hand, COVID-19 risk perception motivates employees to perform safely; on the other hand, COVID-19 risk perception could also undermine safety performance through triggering anxiety. In an effort to find ways that alleviate the negative implications of risk perception, we also tested a cross-level interaction model where the risk perceptionCanxiety relation is weakened with a favorable team safety climate as well as low abusive supervision. Our data were collected from car dealership employees located in China in March 2020, when businesses just started to reopen in locations where these data were collected. Results showed that COVID-19 risk perception was positively related to anxiety, which in turn undermined safety performance. This negative effect canceled out the direct positive effects of COVID-19 risk perception on safety performance. In addition, cross-level interaction results showed that the buffering effect of team safety climate on the risk perceptionCanxiety relation was diminished with an abusive supervisor.

The uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among children will be instrumental in limiting the spread of the disease as herd immunity may require vaccine coverage of up to 80% of the population. Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. PURPOSE: To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers' intent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available. METHOD: An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child (62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination was the vaccine's novelty (52%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history. Public health strategies need to address barriers to uptake by providing evidence about an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy, highlighting the risks and consequences of infection in children, and educating caregivers on the role of vaccination.","output":"Caregiver willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19: Cross sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that requires hospitalization.

We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor through the upregulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis.

High-risk patients have avoided hospital environments fearing infection. We hypothesize that there was also a decrease in the search for medical care related to gastrointestinal emergencies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during and before the months of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a transversal study. The inclusion criteria were cases of consultation in the emergency department for gastrointestinal diseases that required hospitalization, from January to April, from 2015 to 2020. The pediatric population (under age 12) was excluded. RESULTS: A total of 2,457 cases of cases was included. The number of emergency hospitalizations for gastrointestinal cases decreased during the first four months of 2020: 108, 112, 82, and 77, respectively. Comparing April of 2020 with previous years, there was a lower than expected number of cases during the social distancing period (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: This study reports a pronounced decrease in consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during the pandemic.

Current chemotherapy for arenavirus infection is limited to the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, which is characterized by considerable toxicity and treatment failure. Using Pichinde virus as a model arenavirus, we attempted to design glycoprotein-derived fusion inhibitors similar to the FDA-approved anti-HIV peptide enfuvirtide. We have identified a GP2-derived peptide, AVP-p, with antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. The 50% inhibitory dose (IC50) for the peptide is 7 M, with complete inhibition of viral plaque formation at approximately 20 M, and its antiviral activity is largely sequence dependent. AVP-p demonstrates activity against viruses with the Old and New World arenavirus viral glycoprotein complex but not against enveloped viruses of other families. Unexpectedly, fusion assays reveal that the peptide induces virus-liposome fusion at neutral pH and that the process is strictly glycoprotein mediated. As observed in cryo-electron micrographs, AVP-p treatment causes morphological changes consistent with fusion protein activation in virions, including the disappearance of prefusion glycoprotein spikes and increased particle diameters, and fluorescence microscopy shows reduced binding by peptide-treated virus. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements suggest that glycoproteins are destabilized by peptide-induced alterations in viral membrane order. We conclude that untimely deployment of fusion machinery by the peptide could render virions less able to engage in on-pathway receptor binding or endosomal fusion. AVP-p may represent a potent, highly specific, novel therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Because the only drug available to combat infection by Lassa virus, a highly pathogenic arenavirus, is toxic and prone to treatment failure, we identified a peptide, AVP-p, derived from the fusion glycoprotein of a nonpathogenic model arenavirus, which demonstrates antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. AVP-p is unique among self-derived inhibitory peptides in that it shows broad, specific activity against pseudoviruses bearing Old and New World arenavirus glycoproteins but not against viruses from other families. Further, the peptide's mechanism of action is highly novel. Biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy indicate that AVP-p induces premature activation of viral fusion proteins through membrane perturbance. Peptide treatment, however, does not increase the infectivity of cell-bound virus. We hypothesize that prematurely activated virions are less fit for receptor binding and membrane fusion and that AVP-p may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection.","output":"Inhibition of arenavirus infection by a glycoprotein-derived peptide with a novel mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hypercoagulability may contribute to COVID\\\\19 pathogenicity.

In surveys and reports, farmers have indicated several changes caused by the pandemic that impact their businesses, such as increase in local food demand, reduction in on-farm labor, and limitations on hosting on-farm visits with customers. The MUE StrikeForce project team, a U.S. Department of Agriculture strategic initiative, continued to serve farmers by developing alternative educational opportunities that incorporated social distancing and other preventative actions, and were of immediate use to farmers in a crisis. Several of the educational approaches, including video conferencing, online teaching, digital recordings, video repositories, social media communications, pick up and drop off locations, and the use of multiple online viewing platforms such as Zoom recordings have proven to be effective in helping farmers sustain their businesses and have substantially increased access to programming across the state. The convenience of accessing education and learning opportunities online also appealed to more participants. Overall, online educational delivery was positively received by producers, demonstrating the efficacy of digital learning when paired with offline resources and support from the StrikeForce project team. After the pandemic ends, MUE will continue to implement these approaches. Nevertheless, the traditional Extension approach of one-on-one consulting and farm visits cannot be completely replaced by online educational programming.

This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020. RESULTS: Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.","output":"Tobacco use as a well-recognized cause of severe COVID-19 manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been to minimize social contact through lockdown measures. The closure of non-essential businesses to tackle the spread of the coronavirus has had negative consequences for the global economy, production, and employment. OBJECTIVE: To outline how known occupational health principles can be used for preventative management of the coronavirus in workplaces to support resumption of work. METHODS: A discussion of current knowledge of COVID-19, the cost of the lockdown strategy, and preventative biological cycle management. RESULTS: The evidence-based literature indicates that biological cycle management can control the risk of coronavirus infection, provide a suitable and sufficient exit strategy from lockdown, and support getting employees back to work. Adherence to personal protective equipment standards has been insufficient, indicating a need for workplace investment and education. CONCLUSION: Imposed restrictions on workplace operations can be lifted without compromising worker health and safety when a workplace commits to practicing the three principles of biological cycle management.","output":"Let's get back to work: Preventive biological cycle management of COVID-19 in the workplace"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal feline immune-mediated disease caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).

The measures indicate increases in the information transmissions during the pandemic which are uniform across the volatilities and the returns of all assets. In these transmissions, the option implied volatilities are found to play the central role, particularly in the returns of the assets as opposed to its realized volatilities. Thus, we may conclude that the predictability of the volatilities derived from option pricing models has improved during the pandemic and that this improvement has reduced the uncertainty of the future returns and the volatilities, albeit to a lower extent.

Although various efforts have been taken by the hospital to reduce the risk, however, outbreaks still continue to occur. This case study reports on an outbreak investigation using computation flow analysis to investigate an outbreak in a non-COVID-19 ward. Material and Methods: This is a case report of an outbreak that occurs in a non-COVID-19 ward in a teaching hospital in Malaysia. The outbreak investigation was conducted, which includes contact tracing, risk assessment, walk-through survey, airflow measurements and computational flow analysis (CFA). Results: The outbreak occurred in one of the five bedded cubicles in a non-COVID-19 ward. The index case was a patient that was admitted for non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. The index case subsequently transmitted the disease to three patients and one HCW. On initial assessment, the HCW was not considered to have acquired COVID-19 from the index case, as the HCW have no unprotected contact with the index case. However, after the walk-through survey assessment, it was noted that airflow may be a contributing factor. An airflow measurement and CFA was conducted and reviewed the possibility route of transmission.

In this work, we produce CDs with branched-polyethylenimine (b-PEI) chemically functionalized on the surfaces. The thus newly synthesized P-CDs successfully overcome the bottleneck of ACQ effect and display efficient red and NIR emission in aggregate state. Under the excitation of 520 nm, a strong red emission (maxima of 640 nm) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 21% was observed for the P-CDs in neat film.

The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits. A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test.

The present study aimed at assessing the impact of prior antidepressant treatment on brain function in currently depressed but unmedicated individuals by investigating for any differences between antidepressant-na?ve vs. antidepressant-experienced subjects. Fifty right-handed patients (22 medication-na?ve vs. 28 medication-experienced), suffering from major depression participated in the study. They all underwent a standardised clinical interview and psychometric assessment combined with neurobiological tests (brain SPECT, Dexamethasone Suppression Test, Dexfenfluramine Challenge Test, electro-oculogram, flash-electroretinogram and flash-visual evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials). No significant differences between medication-na?ve and medication-experienced depressed subjects were found in terms of the neurobiological markers assessed, after controlling for age, sex, age at onset, number of depressive episodes, depression subtype (melancholic, atypical or undifferentiated) and severity of current episode. Unmedicated currently depressed patients, no matter their previous exposure to antidepressants, show similar changes in brain function. This does not necessarily mean that antidepressants do not have a long term effect on brain physiology, since not all patients relapse. However, it seems that those patients who relapse after stopping medication, seem to 'regress' to an 'as if never medicated' state, with regard to brain function. These findings might suggest that continuous maintenance treatment with antidepressants is essential for patients at high risk to relapse. Alternatively, they might suggest that our methodology assesses only a shallow and mainly state part of the pathophysiology of depression.","output":"No differences between drug naive and drug experienced unipolar depressed patients in terms of neurobiological testing: a cross sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de COVID-19, es un problema social y especialmente de salud cuya aparicin ha permitido destacar la circulacin de otras epidemias concurrentes que estn afectando a la poblacin y la crisis socioeconmica y estructural presente en distintos pases.

Given its complexity and variation in presentation, the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis requires obtaining a detailed exposure history and thorough workup. Case Description: A 17-year-old previously healthy female without asthma history developed cough, fever, and shortness of breath. A week later, she was intubated for acute respiratory failure. Her initial imaging revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium with ground glass opacities. The etiology of her respiratory failure remained unclear. Infectious workup, including multiple COVID tests, was negative. Given that she cares for horses, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was done and revealed elevated aspergillus fumigatus IgG level >200 mcg/mL and total IgE of 571 kU/L. BAL showed elevated neutrophil count and lung biopsy was not obtained. She was extubated after a week and subsequently revealed that she vapes marijuana. This introduced e-cigarette and vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) as another etiology for her presentation. She ultimately completed an extended course of steroids and was discharged on supplemental oxygen. Discussion: Our patient presented with acute respiratory failure and negative infectious workup. Initial social history revealed frequent exposure to horse barns, leading to a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, it was subsequently revealed that she vaped, which introduced EVALI as another possibility.

However, Pmus is not commonly measured since an esophageal balloon catheter is required. We have previously shown that Pmus can be estimated by measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) through the Pmus/EAdi index (PEI). We investigated whether PEI could be reliably measured by a brief end-expiratory occlusion maneuver to propose an automated PEI measurement performed by the ventilator. Pmus, EAdi, airway pressure (Paw), and flow waveforms of 12 critically ill patients undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation were recorded. Repeated end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were performed. PEI was measured at 100 ms (PEI(0.1)) and 200 ms (PEI(0.2)) from the start of the occlusion and compared to the PEI measured at the maximum Paw deflection (PEI(occl), reference). PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2) tightly correlated with PEI(occl), (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.843 and 0.847). At a patient-level analysis, the highest percentage error was -64% and 50% for PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2), respectively, suggesting that PEI(0.2) might be a more reliable measurement. After correcting the error bias, the PEI(0.2) percentage error was lower than  30% in all but one subjects (range ? 39 to + 29%). It is possible to calculate PEI over a brief airway occlusion of 200 ms at inspiratory onset without the need for a full patient's inspiratory effort. Automated and repeated brief airway occlusions performed by the ventilator can provide a real time measurement of PEI; combining the automatically measured PEI with the EAdi trace could be used to continuously display the Pmus waveform at the bedside without the need of an esophageal balloon catheter.

We hypothesized that septic and cardiogenic shock have different effects on hepatosplanchnic lactate exchange and its contribution to hyperlactatemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS 24 anesthetized pigs were randomized to fecal peritonitis (P), cardiac tamponade (CT), and to controls (n = 8 per group). Oxygen transport and lactate exchange were calculated during 24 hours. RESULTS While hepatic lactate influx increased in P and in CT, hepatic lactate uptake remained unchanged in P and decreased in CT. Hepatic lactate efflux contributed 20% (P) and 33% (CT), respectively, to whole body venous efflux. Despite maintained hepatic arterial blood flow, hepatic oxygen extraction did not increase in CT. CONCLUSIONS Whole body venous lactate efflux is of similar magnitude in hyperdynamic sepsis and in cardiogenic shock. Although jejunal mucosal pCO2 gradients are increased, enhanced lactate production from other tissues is more relevant to the increased arterial lactate. Nevertheless, the liver fails to increase hepatic lactate extraction in response to rising hepatic lactate influx, despite maintained hepatic oxygen consumption. In cardiac tamponade, regional, extrasplanchnic lactate production is accompanied by hepatic failure to increase oxygen extraction and net hepatic lactate output, despite maintained hepatic arterial perfusion.","output":"Different contribution of splanchnic organs to hyperlactatemia in fecal peritonitis and cardiac tamponade."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causative agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide to date.

Here we explore the potential role of cross-reactivity induced by eHCoVs on age-specific COVID-19 severity in a mathematical model of eHCoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We use an individual-based model, calibrated to prior knowledge of eHCoV dynamics, to fully track individual histories of exposure to eHCoVs. We also model the emergent dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of hospitalisation upon infection. RESULTS: We hypothesise that primary exposure with any eHCoV confers temporary cross-protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, while life-long re-exposure to the same eHCoV diminishes cross-protection, and increases the potential for disease severity. We show numerically that our proposed mechanism can explain age patterns of COVID-19 hospitalisation in EU/EEA countries and the UK. We further show that some of the observed variation in health care capacity and testing efforts is compatible with country-specific differences in hospitalisation rates under this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a \\"proof of possibility\\" for certain biological and epidemiological mechanisms that could potentially drive COVID-19-related variation across age groups.

Those who progress to end-stage kidney disease often commence dialysis as a life-extending treatment. For cognitively impaired patients, the decision as to whether they commence dialysis will fall to someone else. This scoping review was conducted to map existing literature pertaining to how decisions about dialysis are and should be made with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity. In doing so, it forms the basis of a larger body of work that is exploring how these decisions ought to be made. METHODS: To identify relevant papers, searches were conducted on Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, PsychINFO, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were then applied, requiring that papers: report on empirical studies about how decisions about dialysis are made and/or discuss how decisions about dialysis should be made with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity; be published from 1961 onwards; and be published in English. This resulted in 27 papers eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Of note, the majority of papers originated in the United States. There was wide variation across the included papers. Extracted data were grouped under the following themes: involving various parties (patient involvement, family dominance, and wider communication); objectivity about care options (including difficulties with family detachment); cultural sensitivity; medical versus non-medical factors; managing nonadherent patients; and the role and prevalence of substituted judgement. The literature shows that there is inconsistency in the principles and processes surrounding decisions made about dialysis with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review demonstrates that there is significant variation in both the practice and theory of dialysis decision making with, for, and on behalf of cognitively impaired adult patients. Complexity arises in considering who should get a say, how influential their say should be in a decision, and what factors are most relevant to the decision.

The plight of Rohingya refugees is among the harshest. It has severely affected their existing HIV/STI prevention and management services and further increased the risk of violence and onward HIV transmission within the camps. In this commentary, we discuss the context and the changing dynamics of HIV/AIDS during COVID-19 among the Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh. What we currently observe is the worst crisis in the Rohingya refugee camps thus far. Firstly, because of being displaced, Rohingya refugees have increased vulnerability to HIV, as well as to STIs and other poor health outcomes. Secondly, for the same reason, they have inadequate access to HIV testing treatment and care. Not only because of their refugee status but also because of the poor capacity of the host country to provide services. Thirdly, a host of complex economic, socio-cultural and behavioural factors exacerbate their dire situation with access to HIV testing, treatment and care. And finally, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed priorities in all societies, including the refugee camps. In the context of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis, more emphasis is placed on COVID-19 rather than other health issues, which exacerbates the dire situation with HIV detection, management, and prevention among Rohingya refugees. Despite the common crisis experienced by most countries around the world, the international community has an obligation to work together to improve the life, livelihood, and health of those who are most vulnerable.

Few studies have reported data at more than one time point. AIMS: To compare psychosocial well-being among hospital clinicians at two different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHODS: Participants included doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health clinicians at a multi-site, public health service in Melbourne, Australia. Data were collected via two cross-sectional, online surveys: May to June (wave 1; n = 638) and October to December 2020 (wave 2; n = 358). The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) assessed psychological well-being in the past week. Investigator-devised questions assessed COVID-19 concerns and perceived work impacts. General linear models were used to assess impact of wave on psychological distress. RESULTS: There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Both positive (e.g. learning experience) and negative (e.g. risk of getting COVID-19) impacts were reported. In both waves, staff were most concerned about health risks to family members. Wave 2 respondents were significantly more likely than wave 1 respondents to indicate concerns about colleagues having COVID-19, increased workloads, leave cancellation and increased conflict at work (all P < 0.001). Adjusting for sex, age, self-rated health and discipline group, depression, anxiety and stress scores were significantly higher for respondents in the second than the first wave (all P < 0.001).

Specifically, we allow shrinking state variances towards zero to avoid overfitting, extend the SSVS (spike and slab variable selection) prior to the more flexible normal-inverse-gamma prior which stays agnostic about the underlying model size, as well as adapt the horseshoe prior to the BSTS. The application to nowcasting GDP growth as well as a simulation study demonstrate that the horseshoe prior BSTS improves markedly upon the SSVS and the original BSTS model with the largest gains in dense data-generating-processes.

However, molten salts also have unfavorable effects, including electronic conductivity and significant capability of dissolving oxygen and carbon dioxide gases. In addition, although molten salts are relatively simple in terms of composition, physical properties, and decomposition reactions at inert electrodes, in comparison with aqueous electrolytes, the high temperatures of molten salts may promote unwanted electrode-electrolyte interactions.

A qualitative study in the first stage was carried out through in-depth interviews, FGD and study documents. Data were analyzed through coding, categorizing, pattern matching and theorizing. The second stage was a survey conducted using instruments built in the first stage. Data were analyzed using Rasch modeling and logistic regression. RESULTS: District TB case detection rate (CDR) has improved from 35% (2018) to 104% (2019). The contribution of private hospitals has increased considerably. However, there were almost none from the private primary healthcare facilities. The substantive theory generated indicates that awareness and concern of the TB problem, TB program comprehension and involvement, and institutional support are behind the readiness of facilities to engage the TB program (the readiness to engage). The measurement results indicate the significant correlation of all dimensions on readiness to engage. Concern of the TB problem and institutional support are variables that influence readiness to engage (p < 0.05).

Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome.

Programmes to promote FMS development have been primarily delivered in childcare settings. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of an interactive digital application, designed to be co-used by parent and child, to increase FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moovosity? programme, a novel digital application to increase FMS proficiency in 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 34 parent-child dyads randomly assigned to either the 8-week intervention (n = 17) or wait-list control (n = 17) condition. FMS proficiency, PA, and parental support for PA was assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Intervention participants were given free access to the app over a period of 8 weeks. Wait-listed controls were given access after the 8-week period. Group differences for pre to post changes in outcomes were tested for significance using general linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction for object control skills (F1,32 = 10.81, P = 0.003). Intervention children exhibited significant improvements in object control skills, while children in the wait-list control group exhibited a modest decline. Intervention children also exhibited improvements in locomotor skills, while wait-listed controls exhibited minimal change; however, the group by time interaction fell outside the 0.05 level of significance (F1,32 = 3.15, P = 0.09).

The relationship between personality traits and academic performance in the FC model in which collaborative group studies are carried out is important for the design of individualized learning environments. In this context, the aim of this study is to research the relationship between academic success and personality traits within a collaborative flipped classroom model. Additionally, in this study, the differentiation of the relationship between academic success and personality traits according to gender, motivation, engagement, and interaction variables were examined. In this research, relational screening model was utilized. The application was achieved through the participation of 167 students for a 14-week period in Turkey. In the research, self-description form and data collection instruments were utilized. At the end of this research, Extraversion from personality traits is the strongest predictor of academic performance in FC. According to descriptive statistics, it was found that female students scored higher in FC settings for extraversion, and male students had higher scores for openness than other structures. In addition, it was found that the motivation scores of women and engagement scores of men were prominent. It was observed that the openness personality of the students with low motivation and the agreeableness of the students with high motivation is more dominant than the other personality structures. Students with the low level of engagement had the highest openness, and those with high agreeableness scores were the highest. The students with the low level of interaction had the highest openness scores, while those with high levels of interaction had the highest conscientiousness. While personality traits and academic achievements of students differed significantly according to gender, motivation and interaction levels, no significant difference was found according to engagement levels.

The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 widely varies from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammatory disease. It is thought that host genetic variability may affect the hosts response to the virus infection and thus cause severity of the disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus requires interaction with its receptor complex in the host cells before infection. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as one of the key molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor binding and cell invasion. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the correlation between a genetic variant within the human TMPRSS2 gene and COVID-19 severity and viral load. RESULTS: We genotyped 95 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in Dr Soetomo General Hospital and Indrapura Field Hospital (Surabaya, Indonesia) for the TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism. Polymorphism was detected using a TaqMan assay. We then analysed the association between the presence of the genetic variant and disease severity and viral load. We did not observe any correlation between the presence of TMPRSS2 genetic variant and the severity of the disease. However, we identified a significant association between the p.Val160Met polymorphism and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, as estimated by the Ct value of the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test. Furthermore, we observed a trend of association between the presence of the C allele and the mortality rate in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate a possible association between TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and the outcome of COVID-19.

Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable in less than 24 hours.

Numerous web-based decision support tools (DSTs) have been developed, both by public and commercial stakeholders, to assist their decision making. Though most of the DSTs underlying algorithms are similar and simple decision trees, their mode of presentation differs: some DSTs present a static flowchart, while others are designed as a conversational agent, guiding the user through the decision trees nodes step-by-step in an interactive manner. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether interactive DSTs provide greater decision support than noninteractive (ie, static) flowcharts. METHODS: We developed mock interfaces for 2 DSTs (1 static, 1 interactive), mimicking patient-facing, freely available DSTs for COVID-19-related self-assessment. Their underlying algorithm was identical and based on the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions guidelines. We recruited adult US residents online in November 2020. Participants appraised the appropriate social and care-seeking behavior for 7 fictitious descriptions of patients (case vignettes). Participants in the experimental groups received either the static or the interactive mock DST as support, while the control group appraised the case vignettes unsupported. We determined participants accuracy, decision certainty (after deciding), and mental effort to measure the quality of decision support. Participants ratings of the DSTs usefulness, ease of use, trust, and future intention to use the tools served as measures to analyze differences in participants perception of the tools. We used ANOVAs and t tests to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Our survey yielded 196 responses. The mean number of correct assessments was higher in the intervention groups (interactive DST group: mean 11.71, SD 2.37; static DST group: mean 11.45, SD 2.48) than in the control group (mean 10.17, SD 2.00). Decisional certainty was significantly higher in the experimental groups (interactive DST group: mean 80.7%, SD 14.1%; static DST group: mean 80.5%, SD 15.8%) compared to the control group (mean 65.8%, SD 20.8%). The differences in these measures proved statistically significant in t tests comparing each intervention group with the control group (P<.001 for all 4 t tests). ANOVA detected no significant differences regarding mental effort between the 3 study groups. Differences between the 2 intervention groups were of small effect sizes and nonsignificant for all 3 measures of the quality of decision support and most measures of participants perception of the DSTs. CONCLUSIONS: When the decision space is limited, as is the case in common COVID-19 self-assessment DSTs, static flowcharts might prove as beneficial in enhancing decision quality as interactive tools. Given that static flowcharts reveal the underlying decision algorithm more transparently and require less effort to develop, they might prove more efficient in providing guidance to the public. Further research should validate our findings on different use cases, elaborate on the trade-off between transparency and convenience in DSTs, and investigate whether subgroups of users benefit more with 1 type of user interface than the other.

In the present work, we report for the first time the construction of an immunosensor using a commercial 3D conductive filament of carbon black and polylactic acid (PLA) to detect Hantavirus Araucaria nucleoprotein (Np) as a proof-of-concept. The recognition biomolecule was anchored directly at the filament surface by using N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Conductive and non-conductive composites of PLA were characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), revealing around 30% w/w of carbon in the filament. Morphological features of composites were obtained from SEM and TEM measurements. FTIR measurement revealed that crosslinking agents were covalently bonded at the filament surface. Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for the evaluation of each step involved in the construction of the proposed immunosensor. The results showed the potentiality of the device for the quantitative detection of Hantavirus Araucaria nucleoprotein (Np) from 30 g mL(?1) to 240 g mL(?1) with a limit of detection of 22 g mL(?1). Also, the proposed immunosensor was applied with success for virus detection in 100x diluted human serum samples.

Among the surveys, conceptual/theoretical studies, reviews, and case studies, it was found that almost two-thirds of the theoretical articles discuss models that include DES along with other analytical techniques, such as optimization and lean/six sigma, and one-third of the applications were carried out in more than one healthcare setting, with emergency departments being the most popular. Moreover, half of the applications seek to improve time- and efficiency-related metrics, and one-third of all papers use hybrid models. Finally, the most popular DES software is Arena and Simul8. Overall, there is an increasing trend towards using DES in healthcare to address issues at an operational level, yet less than 10% of DES applications present actual implementations following the modeling stage. Thus, future research should focus on the implementation of the models to assess their impact on healthcare processes, patients, and, possibly, their clinical value.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Single institution studies have documented COVID-19 disproportionally affected US racial and ethnic minority groups compared to Whites. However, few population-wide data studied severity and death in multiracial populations. We aim to examine the current disparity in the COVID-19 continuum, including hospitalizations, severity, and death. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Data on 67,094 laboratory documented COVID-19 cases nested from the state-wide OneFlorida research consortium through August 3, 2020, were assessed to decide differences and disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. A COVID-19 outcome continuum outlining the proportions of cases transitioning from diagnosis to death was constructed (Figure 1). OneFlorida partners provide health care to more than 40% of Floridians in the nations third-largest and very diverse state. OneFlorida partners encompass hospitals, practice/clinic settings, and physicians, which provide care for 15 million patients across all of Floridas 67 counties. It is part of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among cases, 25,443 (37.9%) were non-Hispanic Whites, 11,709 (17.5%) were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 16,119 (24.0%) were Hispanics. Among COVID-19 patients, Blacks and Hispanics had a higher frequency of emergency department (ED) visits (45.7% and 46.0%, respectively), whereas admission rates were higher in Blacks (15.6%) and Whites (15.9%) than in Hispanics (11.5%). Blacks had the highest rates of intubation (3.6%) and in-hospital deaths (2.7%) compared to Whites (2.5% and 2.3%, respectively) and Hispanics (1.3% and 1.4%, respectively), Figure 1. When rates were indexed to the state census data, Blacks had the worst rates across the disease continuum (infection to death). In comparison, Hispanics had higher rates of ED visits but lower rates of intubation and death, Table 1.

Using data from a prospective cohort of children with influenza-like illness, we examined the virology of ARTI and determined the clinical impact of virus-virus codetection. METHODS: Children aged 6 to 59 months who presented to a tertiary pediatric hospital between influenza seasons 2008 and 2012 with fever and acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled, and nasal samples were collected. Respiratory viruses were identified by culture and polymerase chain reaction. We compared demographics, presenting symptoms, and clinical outcomes of children with a single-virus infection and those in whom 2 or more viruses were detected (virus-virus codetection). We used logistic regression models and estimated marginal means to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and probabilities of symptom presentation, prescription of antibiotics, and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 2356 children, a virus was detected in 1630 (69.2%) of them; rhinovirus (40.8%), influenza (29.5%), and respiratory syncytial virus (26.4%) were detected most commonly. Two or more viruses were detected in 25% of these children. After we adjusted for demographic factors, children with virus-virus codetection had greater odds of presenting with cough (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2C3.1) and rhinorrhea (aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1C2.9) than those with a single-virus infection, although both symptoms were common.

METHODS: Monocentric retrospective study, on a cohort of 996 adult patients referred to our department between March 2001 and December 2018 for a diagnostic work-up of uveitis. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two biomarkers were calculated in different contexts. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-eight patient cases were reviewed. The mean age at uveitis onset was 49.4 (18.6) years. Of them, 144 patients had a diagnosis of sarcoid uveitis. An elevated sACE had SE of 45.8%, Sp of 88.8%, PPV of 44.9% and NPV of 89.2% in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. For lymphopaenia, SE was 15.3%, Sp was 96.7%, PPV was 47.8% and NPV was 85.2%. For the combination of elevated sACE and lymphopaenia, SE was 18.9%, Sp was 99.0%, PPV was 73.9% and NPV was 89.5%.

Two laparoscopic accesses to the adrenal have been developed: transperitoneal and retroperitoneal. Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy may be recommended for the treatment of pheochromocytoma with the same peri-operative outcomes of the transperitoneal approach because it allows direct access to the adrenal glands without increasing the operative risks. Although technically more demanding than the transperitoneal approach, retroperitoneoscopy can shorten the mean operative time, which is critical for cases with pheochromocytoma where minimizing the potential for intra-operative hemodynamic changes is essential.

There is need for more guidance on taking flexible, complexity-aware approaches to governance that foster integration and adaptability in the health system. Over the past two decades, paramedics in Ontario, Canada have been filling gaps in health and social services beyond their traditional mandate of emergency transport. Studying these grassroots, local programs can provide insight into how health systems can be more integrated, adaptive and responsive. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people involved in new, integrated models of paramedic care in Ontario. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed and coded inductively for participants experiences, including drivers, enablers and barriers to implementation. Thematic analysis was done to ascertain key concepts from across the dataset. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants from across Ontarios five administrative health regions participated in the study. Participants described a range of programs that included acute, urgent and preventative care driven by local relationship networks of paramedics, hospitals, primary care, social services and home care. Three themes were developed that represent participants experiences implementing these programs in the Ontario context. The first theme, adapting and being nimble in tension with system structures, related to distributed versus central control of programs, a desire to be nimble and skepticism towards prohibitive legal and regulatory systems. The second theme, evolving and flexible professional role identity, highlighted the value and challenges of a functionally flexible workforce and interest in new roles amongst the paramedic profession. The third theme, unpredictable influences on program implementation, identified events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and changing government priorities as accelerating, redirecting or inhibiting local program development. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study add to the discourse on governing health systems towards being more integrated, adaptive and responsive to population needs. Governance strategies include: supporting networks of local organizational relationships; considering the role of a functionally flexible health workforce; promoting a shared vision and framework for collaboration; and enabling distributed, local control and experimentation.","output":"Building integrated, adaptive and responsive healthcare systems C lessons from paramedicine in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the greatest challenges facing crisis management is the cold hard fact that the most disparate and seemingly unrelated crises have a strange way of linking up and thus of doing even greater damage than if they had occurred simply and solely by themselves.

The covid19-nmr consortium seeks to support drug development by providing publicly accessible NMR data on the viral RNA elements and proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises a single RNA of about 30 kb in length, in which 14 open reading frames (ORFs) have been annotated, and encodes approximately 30 proteins. The first two-thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is made up of two large overlapping open-reading-frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) encoding a replicase polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved to yield 16 so-called non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), which is considered to be a major virulence factor, suppresses host immune functions by associating with host ribosomal complexes at the very end of its C-terminus. Furthermore, Nsp1 facilitates initiation of viral RNA translation via an interaction of its N-terminal domain with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral RNA.

Both pre- and postsynaptic forms of homeostasis are important, but their relative impact on fidelity is unknown. To address this issue, we studied auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus of mice of both sexes. These synapses undergo bidirectional pre- and postsynaptic homeostatic changes with increased and decreased acoustic stimulation. We found that both young and mature synapses exhibit similar activity-dependent changes in short-term depression. Experiments using chelators and imaging both indicated that presynaptic Ca2+ influx decreased after noise exposure, and increased after ligating the ear canal. By contrast, Ca2+ cooperativity was unaffected. Experiments using specific antagonists suggest that occlusion leads to changes in the Ca2+ channel subtypes driving neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, dynamic-clamp experiments revealed that spike fidelity primarily depended on changes in presynaptic depression, with some contribution from changes in postsynaptic intrinsic properties. These experiments indicate that presynaptic Ca2+ influx is homeostatically regulated in vivo to enhance synaptic fidelity.Significance StatementHomeostatic mechanisms in synapses maintain stable function in the face of different levels of activity. Both juvenile and mature auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells modify short-term depression in different acoustic environments, which raises the question of what the underlying presynaptic mechanisms are and the relative importance of pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the faithful transfer of information. Changes in short-term depression under different acoustic conditions were a result of changes in presynaptic Ca2+ influx. Spike fidelity was affected by both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes after ear-occlusion and was only affected by presynaptic changes after noise-rearing. These findings are important for understanding regulation of auditory synapses under normal conditions and also in disorders following noise exposure or conductive hearing loss.","output":"Mechanisms and functional consequences of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity at auditory nerve synapses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acceptance by, and cooperation with relevant stakeholders in developing new sustainability initiatives when they are generally perceived as positive, is one of the keys for successful implementation of such new sustainability initiatives later on.

One of the most important clinical manifestations is pneumonia and the subsequent worsening of the hyperinflammatory state and cytokine storm. Tocilizumab (TCB) is a recombinant humanized, anti-human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1k (IgG1k) subclass that acts against soluble and membrane-bound interleukin six receptors (IL-6R). There is wide use of TCB in rheumatic diseases. However, recently this medication has been used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab application in COVID-19 patients with a high risk of a cytokine storm shows a positive response in reducing the mortality rate. Moreover, TCB minimizes the time needed to recover, improves oxygenation, shortens the duration of vasopressor support, and reduces the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore we provide an overview of recent studies to understand the efficacy of this drug under various circumstances, including COVID-19 and rheumatic pathologies. This article also explores and integrates the different treatment possibilities in prominent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory-related symptoms. The preliminary data demonstrate promising results regarding the efficacy of TCB use in severe COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: The county-level data on COVID-19 death counts as of October 23, 2020, were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University. SDoH data were collected from the County Health Ranking and Roadmaps, the US Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Semiparametric negative binomial regressions with expected counts based on standardized mortality rates as offset variables were fitted using integrated Laplace approximation. Bayesian significance was assessed by 95% credible intervals (CrI) of risk ratios (RR). County-level mortality hotspots were identified by exceedance probabilities. FINDINGS: The COVID-19 mortality rates per 100,000 were 65.43 for the urban and 50.78 for the rural counties. Percent of Blacks, HIV, and diabetes rates were significantly associated with higher mortality in rural and urban counties, whereas the unemployment rate (adjusted RR = 1.479, CrI = 1.171, 1.867) and residential segregation (adjusted RR = 1.034, CrI = 1.019, 1.050) were associated with increased mortality in urban counties.

METHODS To construct the instrument, items were developed based on consultations with stakeholders and review of existing literature. The instrument was then pilot tested and items were modified based on relevance, importance, item-total correlations, and fit with the instrument's overall factor structure. The modified instrument was validated through assessing internal validity (reliability), convergent & discriminant validity, concurrent validity, and practical usefulness at two time points (pre-COVID and current). RESULTS The scale showed excellent reliability (Cronbach's =.95). It had a four-factor structure which was replicated at the two time-points. The four subscales were moderately correlated (between r =.438 and .744). The scale showed excellent convergent and discriminatory validity, correlating moderately with STAI and GAD, and highly with FAQL-PB. It also showed excellent concurrent validity, differentiating amongst many external variables.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, nationwide IBD cohort study in the Netherlands and identified patients with COVID-19. First, we assessed the COVID-19 disease course and outcomes. Second, we compared COVID-19 incidences between our IBD study cohort and the general Dutch population. RESULTS: We established an IBD cohort of 34,763 patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 100/34,763 patients (0.29%). 20/100 patients (20%) had severe COVID-19 defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and/or death. Hospitalization occurred in 59/100 (59.0%) patients and 13/100 (13.0%) died. All patients who deceased had comorbidities and all but one were > 65 years. In line, we identified > 1 comorbidity as an independent risk factor for hospitalization (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.58-11.17, p = 0.004). Incidences of COVID-19 between the IBD study cohort and the general population were comparable (287.6 (95% CI 236.6-349.7) versus 333.0 (95% CI 329.3-336.7) per 100,000 patients, respectively; p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Of 100 cases with IBD and COVID-19, 20% developed severe COVID-19, 59% was hospitalized and 13% died. A comparable COVID-19 risk was found between the IBD cohort (100/34,763 = 0.29%) and the general Dutch population. The presence of > 1 comorbidities was an independent risk factor for hospitalization due to COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Outcomes of Covid-19 in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rise in patients affected by the coronavirus, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.

However, the state of epidemiological evidence on multigenerational transmission of overweight/obesity, such as from grandparents to grandchildren, is relatively unknown. This systematic review collates and appraises existing evidence on multigenerational transmission of overweight/obesity and uses meta-analytic estimates for quantitative synthesis. Six electronic databases were searched for publications reporting the relationship between grandparents and their grandchildren overweight/obesity status. A total of 25 studies from 17 countries with a combined population of 238,771 study participants met the inclusion criteria. About 60% (15) of the reviewed studies reported a positive association between grandparent-grandchild (GP-GC) overweight/obesity, out of which 11 were statistically significant. Seven studies reported odds ratios of GP-GC overweight/obesity associations and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed a significant GP-GC association in overweight/obesity status (odds ratio [OR]: 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.57). Thus, the current research evidence shows that grandchildren's overweight/obesity status is associated with their grandparents' overweight/obesity status, indicating a multigenerational transmission of obesity. However, more studies, especially from developing countries, are required to assess the robustness of these findings.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nine hospitals caring for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 134 Chinese healthcare professionals (74 doctors and 60 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 epidemic were included. A two-round Delphi process was initiated between March and May 2020. In the first round, the participants identified knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that are needed to treat patients, prevent spread of the virus and protect healthcare workers. In round 2, the participants rated each item according to its importance to be included in a training curriculum on COVID-19. Consensus for inclusion in the final list was set at 80%. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that could form the basis of a training curriculum for COVID-19 management. RESULTS: In the first round 1398 items were suggested by the doctors and reduced to 67 items after content analysis (treatment of patients: n=47; infection prevention and control: n=20). The nurses suggested 1193 items that were reduced to 70 items (treatment of patients: n=49; infection prevention and control: n=21). In round 2, the response rates were 82% in doctors and 93% in nurses. Fifty-eight items of knowledge, technical and behavioural skills were agreed on by the doctors to include in the final list. For the nurses, 58 items were agreed on. CONCLUSIONS: This needs assessment process resulted in a comprehensive list of knowledge, technical and behavioural skills for COVID-19 management.

The three-dimensional microstructure of the material, a fuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and used as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics, and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of oneCtwo pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid transport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced capillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure.

DESIGN Observational, multicenter, prospective study PATIENT SELECTION: This study included children aged 1 month-17 years with CAP, who were hospitalized between April 2012 and May 2019. METHODS An extensive microbiological workup was performed. The clinical, radiographic, and analytical parameters were analyzed for three etiological groups. RESULTS Among the 495 children included, at least one causative pathogen was identified in 262 (52.9%): pathogenic viruses in 155/262 (59.2%); atypical bacteria (AB), mainly Mycoplasma pneumonia, in 84/262 (32.1%); and typical bacteria (TyB) in 40/262 (15.3%). Consolidation was observed in 89/138 (64.5%) patients with viral CAP, 74/84 (88.1%) with CAP caused by AB, and 40/40 (100%) with CAP caused by TyB. Para-pneumonic pleural effusion (PPE) was observed in 112/495 (22.6%) patients, of which 61/112 (54.5%) presented a likely causative pathogen: viruses in 12/61 (19.7%); AB in 23/61 (37.7%); and TyB in 26/61 (42.6%). Viral etiology was significantly frequent in young patients and in those with low oxygen saturation, wheezing, no consolidation, and high lymphocyte counts. CAP patients with AB as the etiological agent had a significantly longer and less serious course as compared to those with other causative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS Viruses and M. pneumonia are the main causes of pediatric CAP in Spain. Wheezing, young age, and no consolidation on radiographs are indicative of viral etiology. Viruses and AB can also cause PPE. Since only a few cases can be directly attributed to TyB, the indications for antibiotics must be carefully considered in each patient.

Arterivirus nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) was shown to have NendoU activity and play essential roles in the viral life cycle. Here, we report three crystal structures of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11 mutants. The structures of arterivirus nsp11 contain two conserved compact domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). The structures of PRRSV and EAV endoribonucleases are similar and conserved in the arterivirus, but they are greatly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV), representing important human pathogens in the Nidovirales order. The catalytic center of NendoU activity is located in the CTD, where a positively charged groove is next to the key catalytic residues conserved in nidoviruses. Although the NTD is nearly identical, the catalytic region of the arterivirus nsp11 family proteins is remarkably flexible, and the oligomerization may be concentration dependent. In summary, our structures provide new insight into this key multifunctional NendoU family of proteins and lay a foundation for better understanding of the molecular mechanism and antiviral drug development. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus are two major members of the arterivirus family. PRRSV, a leading swine pathogen, causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Due to the lack of a suitable vaccine or effective drug treatment and the quick spread of these viruses, infected animals either die quickly or must be culled. PRRSV costs the swine industry around $644 million annually in the United States and almost 1.5 billion in Europe every year. To find a way to combat these viruses, we focused on the essential viral nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11). nsp11 is associated with multiple functions, such as RNA processing and suppression of the infected host innate immunity system. The three structures solved in this study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of this crucial protein family and will benefit the development of new treatments against these deadly viruses.","output":"Structural Biology of the Arterivirus nsp11 Endoribonucleases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After having an introduction to the essential topics, the previous chapters have all provided effective use of deep learning for diagnosis of important diseases, as they are base for the medical decision support systems.

METHODS: In this cohort study, COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan between January 15 and April 1, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were categorized into PLWH and HIV-na?ve group. All patients were followed up regularly (every fifteen days) until November 30, 2020, and the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 was observed. RESULTS: Totally, 18 PLWH and 185 HIV-na?ve individuals with COVID-19 were enrolled. The positive conversion rates of IgG were 56% in PLWH and 88% in HIV-na?ve patients respectively, and the peak was on the 45th day after COVID-19 onset. However, the positive rate of IgG dropped to 12% in PLWH and 33% among HIV-na?ve individuals by the end of the study. The positive conversion rate of IgG among asymptomatic carriers is significantly lower than that among moderate patients (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05C0.65) and PLWH had a lower IgG seroconversion rate compared to the HIV-naive group (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05C0.90).

However, the association between stress and seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing tremendous collateral stress. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on seizures in PWE in the most severely affected area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, PWE were surveyed via online questionnaires between February 23 and March 5, 2020. Collected data included demographic information, epilepsy-related characteristics (seizure type, frequency, antiepileptic drugs [AEDs], and medication management), direct and perceived threat of COVID-19, and changes in seizures during the outbreak. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify precipitants for seizure exacerbation. RESULTS: We received 362 completed questionnaires after excluding 12 duplicates (response rate = 63.51%). A total of 31 (8.56%) patients had increased seizures during the outbreak. Exposure history to COVID-19 (P = .001), uncontrolled seizure after AED therapy (P = .020), seizure frequency of two or more times per month before the outbreak (P = .005), change of AED regimen during the outbreak (AED reduction, withdrawal, replacement, skipping altogether; P = .002), and worry about the adverse effect of the outbreak on overall seizure-related issues (severity = moderate to critical; P = .038) were risk factors for increased seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: A minority of PWE experienced seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID-19. Stress, uncontrolled seizures, and inappropriate change in AED regimen were associated with increased seizures. Based on these findings, stress might be an independent precipitant for triggering seizures in some PWE.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak: The impact of stress on seizures in patients with epilepsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"US health care spending increased 4.6 percent to reach $3.8 trillion in 2019, similar to the rate of growth of 4.7 percent in 2018.

The aim of this study is to compare the experiences of participants in the MED-WELL programme online to those that previously participated in the same programme in-person to understand the student experience and optimize programme delivery. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 participants to a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Ten study participants took part in the MED-WELL programme when it was offered in-person, and the other ten study participants took part in the programme when it was offered online. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed using Microsoft Teams. A combined inductive and deductive approach was used for analysis. An inductive thematic analysis was utilized to categorize data into higher order codes, themes, and overarching themes. The theory of online learning provided the theoretical framework for a deductive approach. RESULTS: Analysis of the data produced five overarching themes: student-student, student-teacher, student-content, student-environment, and effects of a pandemic. The first four themes detail distinct types of interaction that participants had with various entities of the MED-WELL programme and the effects that these interactions had on participant experiences. Effects of a pandemic refers to the context of delivering the MED-WELL programme online during a pandemic and how this mode of delivery influenced participants and the programme.

However, the distribution of phenotypic effects caused by genome-wide random homologous recombination has never been formally investigated. Previous data on the subject have promoted the implicit view that most viral recombinant genomes are likely to be deleterious or lethal if the nucleotide identity of parental sequences is below 90%. We decided to challenge this view by creating a bank of near-random recombinants between two viral species of the genus Begomovirus (Family Geminiviridae) exhibiting 82% nucleotide identity, and by testing infectivity and in planta accumulation of recombinant clones randomly extracted from this bank. The bank was created by DNA-shufflinga technology initially applied to the random shuffling of individual genes, and here implemented for the first time to shuffle full-length viral genomes. Together with our previously described system allowing the direct cloning of full-length infectious geminivirus genomes, it provided a unique opportunity to generate hundreds of mosaic virus genomes, directly testable for infectivity. A subset of 47 randomly chosen recombinants was sequenced, individually inoculated into tomato plants, and compared with the parental viruses. Surprisingly, our results showed that all recombinants were infectious and accumulated at levels comparable or intermediate to that of the parental clones. This indicates that, in our experimental system, despite the fact that the parental genomes differ by nearly 20%, lethal and/or large deleterious effects of recombination are very rare, in striking contrast to the common view that has emerged from previous studies published on other viruses.","output":"Distribution of the Phenotypic Effects of Random Homologous Recombination between Two Virus Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper applies the time varying parameter-vector autoregression model to explore the dynamic relationship between economic policy uncertainty, investor sentiment and financial stability in China in different periods and at different time points.

Our epidemiological study aimed at investigating the frequency and spread of viral hepatitis B, C, and D depending on age and sex in Kazakhstan (5-year period). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized the data from the primary registration of the incidence of hepatitis B, C, and D in 18 regions of Kazakhstan (period: from 2015 to 2020). Age indicators, gender, and territorial characteristics of registered cases were determined and analysed. The data were obtained from the state information system Electronic Register of Dispensary Patients, based on the International Classification of Diseases-10 for coding diseases. RESULTS: During the period studied, 268 975 cases of hepatitis B, C, and D were detected in Kazakhstan. Hepatitis B was registered in n = 109 734 cases. In women, the incidence rate was 40.6% of all cases (n = 44545), and in men it was 59.4% (n = 65189) of all cases (p  0.01). Hepatitis D was detected in 8 656 cases, of which 58.3% (n = 5049) were in men and 41.7% (n = 3607) in women (p  0.01). Hepatitis C was registered in n = 159 585 cases. The rate was higher in the male population (54.6%; n = 82 203) compared to women 45.4% (n = 68382) (p  0.01). In 2020 (in comparison with 2015), there was a significant increase in the incidence of hepatitis D by 68.3%, hepatitis B by 49.8%, and hepatitis C by 46.4%.

Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precision (LP)) to reconstruct a super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single-molecules) that undermine image resolution. Ideally, it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as the fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. Probabilistic Optically-Selective Single-molecule Imaging Based Localization Encoded (POSSIBLE) microscopy explores this possibility by introducing a narrow probability size-distribution of single-molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single-molecules are filtered by the Gaussian function to remove unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct an ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single-molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single-molecule images with an average PSF sizes of    = 15  10 nm, 30  2 nm & 50  2 nm. Results show better-resolved Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared to the traditional SMLM techniques. Cluster analysis indicates densely-packed HA molecules, HA-HA interaction, and a surge in the number of HA molecules per cluster post 24 Hrs of transfection. The study using POSSIBLE microscopy introduces new insights in influenza biology. We anticipate exciting applications in the multidisciplinary field of disease biology, oncology, and biomedical imaging.","output":"Probabilistic Optically-Selective Single-molecule Imaging Based Localization Encoded (POSSIBLE) microscopy for ultra-superresolution imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study was to investigate to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions among dental students about novel COVID-19 infection in the College of Dentistry, King Khalid University Materials and Methods: The current cross-sectional study consists of Sample of 400 (248 males and 152 females) dental students and interns in College of Dentistry King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia Written informed consent was being obtained from the participants after explaining them the purpose of the study Sampling method was including a simple random sampling method A self-administered questionnaire is designed to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of dental students about COVID-19 infection Data were collected and analyzed Results: 6 9% of study subjects were of 30 years 248 (62 4%) and 152 (37 6%) were males and females, respectively for the total study samples More than half of the subject (54%) said that they had attended lectures/discussions about novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) Also, 94 5% know that the incubation period of COVID-19 is 1-14 days;72% felt that about recommended 40 seconds of hand-soap cleaning time would prevent COVID-19 transmission;80% agreed that flu vaccination is sufficient for avoiding COVID-19 Conclusions: This study concludes that the amount of Knowledge about COVID-19 amongst the Saudi dental surgeons was relatively satisfactory Different kinds of awareness seminars and training programs should be conducted at the local level to improve the Knowledge and perceptions among dental surgeons Educational interventions are urgently needed, and further studies are warranted","output":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions: A Survey of Dental students in King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Public health legislation during the CO-VID-19 pandemic has resulted in forced transitioning to the use of remote care in order to continue the provision of pain rehabilitation worldwide The objective of this study was to gain insight into clinicians' initial experiences with the provision of interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation via videoconferencing Design: Observational, cross-sectional design Participants: Twelve team members (specialists in rehabilitation medicine -MD-, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) from a tertiary expertise centre in pain rehabilitation Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a digital survey Theme-based content analysis was performed for qualitative data Results: The themes that emerged were: the compulsory context;prerequisites for proper use of videoconferencing methods, which are strongly associated with the clinicians' experiences;changes experienced in specific components of pain rehabilitation;and overarching changes experienced, including opportunities and limitations (sub-themes: therapeutic relationship, system involvement, efficiency, hands-on possibilities, interdisciplinary teamwork, and formalities) Overall, clinicians expressed moderate agreement with the statements that the quality of the pain rehabilitation programme can be maintained using videoconferencing, and that the COVID-19 pandemic offers opportunities for growth and innovation in telehealth Conclusion: It is feasible to provide valid and satisfactory pain rehabilitation via videoconferencing This study identified facilitators and barriers to the use of videoconferencing, and great potential for integrating aspects of telehealth into standard care after the pandemic","output":"Clinicians' Initial Experiences of Transition to Online Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, social media has rapidly become a crucial communication tool for information generation, dissemination, and consumption.

Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) have potential as simple, scalable, and broadly applicable testing methods. Compared to RT quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based methods, RT-LAMP assays require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP assay protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using a primer set specific for the N gene. We tested our RT-LAMP assay on surplus RNA samples isolated from 768 pharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals being tested for COVID-19. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to an RT-qPCR assay using a sensitive primer set, we found that the RT-LAMP assay reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT) number of up to 30, with a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 99.7%. We also developed a swab-to-RT-LAMP assay that did not require a prior RNA isolation step, which retained excellent specificity (99.5%) but showed lower sensitivity (86% for CT < 30) than the RT-LAMP assay.

Social distancing is highly recommended by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the disease. However, it is difficult to maintain social distancing in highly populated areas where people live in close proximity. Such high-risk areas have the potential to become hotspots for the disease spread, should one person therein contract the disease. Nakkasah is one such area in the Makkah city of Saudi Arabia which has been a hotspot in this pandemic. This study aims to qualitatively explore the experiences of COVID-19 recovered patients residing in this area. Methods We employed semi-structured face-to-face interviews with people living in Nakkasah, above 18 years of age, and recovered from COVID-19. An interview guide was developed, validated, piloted, and minor changes were made. Two trained students conducted the interviews in the Arabic language in a semi-private area of the community center. The interviews were audio-recorded, with informed consent from interviewees, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed later.

Younger (6-11 months) and older (6-15 years old) children tended to have lower vaccine effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the recent vaccine can be recommended to all age groups. METHODS: The overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness was assessed from the 2013/14 until the 2020/21 season using a test-negative case-control design based on rapid influenza diagnostic test results. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated by influenza type and by age group (6C11 months, 1C2, 3C5, 6C12, and 13C15 years old) with adjustments including influenza seasons. RESULTS: A total of 29,400 children (9347, 4435, and 15618 for influenza A and B, and test-negatives, respectively) were enrolled. The overall vaccine effectiveness against influenza A, A(H1N1)pdm09, and B was significant (44% [95% confidence interval (CI), 41C47], 63% [95%CI, 51C72], and 37% [95%CI, 32C42], respectively). The vaccine was significantly effective against influenza A and B, except among children 6 to 11 months against influenza B. The age group with the highest vaccine effectiveness was 1 to 2 years old with both influenza A and B (60% [95%CI, 55C65] and 52% [95%CI, 41C61], respectively). Analysis for the 2020/21 season was not performed because no cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing influenza vaccine effectiveness by age group in children for several seasons, including immediately before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. The fact that significant vaccine effectiveness was observed in nearly every age group and every season shows that the recent vaccine can still be recommended to children for the upcoming influenza seasons, during and after the COVID-19 era.","output":"Trends in effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine in children by age groups in seven seasons immediately before the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province.

Ranging from the misappropriation of mentees work to bullying, ethical issues in mentoring are attributed to poor understanding and structuring of mentoring programs, underlining the need for a consistent approach to mentoring practices. METHODS: Given diverse practices across different settings and the employ of various methodologies, a novel approach to narrative reviews (NR)s is proposed to summarize, interpret, and critique prevailing data on novice mentoring. To overcome prevailing concerns surrounding the reproducibility and transparency of narrative reviews, the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) adopts a structured approach to searching and summarizing the included articles and employed concurrent content and thematic analysis that was overseen by a team of experts. RESULTS: A total of 18 915 abstracts were reviewed, 62 full text articles evaluated and 41 articles included. Ten themes/categories were ascertained identified including Nature; Stakeholders; Relationship; Approach; Environment; Benefits; Barriers; Assessments; Theories and Definitions. CONCLUSION: By compiling and scrutinizing prevailing practice it is possible to appreciate the notion of the mentoring ecosystem which sees each mentee, mentor, and host organization brings with them their own microenvironment that contains their respective goals, abilities, and contextual considerations.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether a group-based exercise program relative to a personal exercise program (both delivered online) and waitlist control (WLC) can improve the psychological health of previously low active older adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Seniors COVID-19 Pandemic and Exercise (SCOPE) trial was a 3-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted between May and September 2020 in which low active older adults (aged 65 years) were recruited via media outlets and social media. After baseline assessments, consented participants were randomized to one of two 12-week exercise programs (delivered online by older adult instructors) or a WLC condition. A total of 241 older adults (n=187 women) provided baseline measures (via online questionnaires), were randomized (n(group)=80, n(personal)=82, n(control)=79), and completed measures every 2 weeks for the duration of the trial. The trials primary outcome was psychological flourishing. Secondary outcomes included global measures of mental and physical health, life satisfaction, and depression symptoms. RESULTS: The results of latent growth modeling revealed no intervention effects for flourishing, life satisfaction, or depression symptoms (P>.05 for all). Participants in the group condition displayed improved mental health relative to WLC participants over the first 10 weeks (effect size [ES]=0.288-0.601), and although the week 12 effect (ES=0.375) was in the same direction the difference was not statistically significant (P=.089). Participants in the personal condition displayed improved mental health, when compared with WLC participants, in the same medium ES range (ES=0.293-0.565) over the first 8 weeks, and while the effects were of a similar magnitude at weeks 10 (ES=0.455, P=.069) and 12 (ES=0.258, P=.353), they were not statistically significant. In addition, participants in the group condition displayed improvements in physical health when compared with the WLC (ES=0.079-0.496) across all 12 weeks of the study following baseline. No differences were observed between the personal exercise condition and WLC for physical health (slope P=.271). CONCLUSIONS: There were no intervention effects for the trials primary outcome (ie, psychological flourishing). It is possible that the high levels of psychological flourishing at baseline may have limited the extent to which those indicators could continue to improve further through intervention (ie, potential ceiling effects). However, the intervention effects for mental and physical health point to the potential capacity of low-cost and scalable at-home programs to support the mental and physical health of previously inactive adults in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The participants were split into two groups: (1) those who chose the ENG-implant and (2) those that refused the implant. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: 151 women were included, with 76.2% selecting the ENG-implant. The average age was 19.5 years; 73.2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32.5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75.5% were not in full time education. Further, 70.5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89.1% unsatisfied with their previous method that opted for the ENG-implant (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Offering the ENG-implant to youths during the immediate postnatal period is evidence-based care, and contraceptive provision is an essential health promotion tool, even during a pandemic. Thinking quickly about public policies in times of crisis is important to guarantee sexual and reproductive rights.","output":"Acceptability of ENG-releasing subdermal implants among postpartum Brazilian young women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to identify the capabilities of secondary school teachers C valued aspects of work that are enabled and can be realized C and investigate the effects of these capabilities on three functionings: flourishing at work, organizational citizenship behavior, and intention to leave.

The teachers responded to the Capability Set for Work Questionnaire, Flourishing-at-Work Scale C Short Form, Organizational Citizenship Behavior Questionnaire, and Intention to Leave Scale. The results showed that three capabilities were most likely to form part of the capability set of teachers: using knowledge and skills, building and maintaining meaningful relationships at work, and contributing to something valuable. Capabilities least likely to form part of the capability set included having a good income, involvement in important decisions, and developing knowledge and skills. The capability set was a strong predictor of emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and a moderate predictor of organizational citizenship behavior and intention to leave.

The most familiar formats use DNA or RNA target amplification methods for enhanced sensitivity above culture and antigen-based procedures. Although gel and plate-hybridisation methods are still utilised for analysis of amplified products, detection using real-time methods which do not require handling of amplified products are favoured in many laboratories. Assays based on nucleic acid amplification and detection can be designed against a broad range of respiratory viruses and have been particularly useful for detection of recently identified viruses such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. However, the wide range of potential pathogens which can cause similar respiratory symptomology and disease makes application of individual diagnostic assays based on detection of DNA and RNA both complex and expensive. One way to resolve this potential problem is to undertake multiplexed nucleic acid amplification reactions with analysis of amplified products by suspension microarray. The Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) from Luminex Molecular Diagnostics is one example of such an approach which could be made available to diagnostic and public health laboratories for broad spectrum respiratory virus detection.","output":"Nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of respiratory viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemics has led to genetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2 and the appearance of variants with potential impact in transmissibility and viral escape from acquired immunity.

This study examines messages issued across two stages established by the World Health Organization (WHO): (a) pre-pandemic early intervention stage and (b) within-pandemic escalation stage. In April 2020, approximately one month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, an experiment using a sample of 769 Australian participants was conducted. Using a between-subject design, participants assessed the way messages (curated and then expertly attributed to the two stages) were perceived and influenced behaviours. Next, it examined the power of words and phrases, selected from the same messages, for (a) their potential to signal risk, warning, and behavioural response and (b) the extent to which they reflected pandemic stages. Results showed that between the two stages, messages were differentiated by negative affect, assertiveness, and risk. Subsequently, increased negative affect, assertiveness, and risk indication increased adaptive behavioural intentions. However, increased assertiveness also increased non-adaptive behavioural intentions, though increased risk indication reduced non-adaptive behavioural intentions. Signal words and phrases, which hold potential as iconic features for biological hazard messages, showed varying performance across message stages, indicating an opportunity to improve them. Taken together, the findings contribute to academic and policy approaches for adapting communication to changing risk.","output":"Communicating COVID-19 risk changes: Signalling with words, phrases, and messages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tahun 2020 merupakan tahun yang mengkhawatirkan seluruh negara tanpa terkecuali negara Indonesia.

Vaccine administration information was collected and ascertained via immunization records. Patients with two dosages of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Sinopharm or Sinovac) were categorized into the vaccinated group (n = 150), while those unvaccinated were classified as control (n = 2035). Propensity score matching was performed to balance the baseline characteristics (14 covariates) between the two groups at a ratio of 1:4. The main outcome measures were the number of oocytes retrieved, good-quality embryo rate and clinical pregnancy rate. RESULTS: There were 146 women in the vaccinated group and 584 in the control group after matching. The number of oocytes retrieved (9.9  7.1 vs 9.9  6.7; P = 0.893), good-quality embryo rate (33.5  29.8% vs 29.9  28.6%; P = 0.184) and clinical pregnancy rate (59.1% vs 63.6%; P = 0.507) were all similar between the two groups.

We also studied a cohort of ninety hospitalized patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and a group of elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who underwent serial QFT-Plus and immune profiling testing. RESULTS: The indeterminate QFT-Plus results rate went from 1.4% (July 2016CNovember 2019) to 4.2% during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evolution of the number of cases with low/very low interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) response in the mitogen tube paralleled the disease activity and number of deaths during the pandemic waves in our region (from March 2020 to October 2021). The percentages of positive QFT-plus patients did not significantly change before and during the pandemic (13.9% vs. 12.2%).

If left undetected and untreated, fear-based signs and symptoms may be extremely debilitating and lead to chronic problems with a risk of permanent damage to the brain's locus coeruleus and stress response circuits. The triage management of susceptible, exposed, and infectious victims seeking care must be sensitive and specific enough to identify individuals with excessive levels of fear in order to address the nuances of fear-based symptoms at the initial point of contact. These acute conditions, which include hyper-vigilant fear, are managed best by timely and effective information, rapid evaluation, and possibly medications that uniquely address the locus-coeruleus-driven noradrenalin over-activation. It is recommended that a Fear and Resilience (FR) Checklist be included as an essential triage tool to identify those most at risk. The use of this checklist facilitates an enhanced capacity to respond to limitations brought about by surge capacity requirements. Whereas the utility of such a checklist is evident, predictive validity studies will be required.

Covid patients develop a wide range of pathologies. This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 in diseases commonly treated by vascular surgeons. METHODS: Four conditions were selected: venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and microangiopathy. A systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines was. RESULTS: Out of 1195 papers reviewed for conditions in COVID-19 patients relevant to routine vascular surgery practice, 43 papers were included and analyzed. Venous thrombosis was found to be the most common COVID-19 associated pathology with a cumulative incidence of 25% at 7 days and 48% at 14 days. Additionally, D-dimer levels proved to be a good predictor, even in the early stages of the disease with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 88.5% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Patients in the ICU demonstrated a significantly higher risk of developing VTE, even when receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Although evidence of arterial thrombosis was less common (1% to 16.3%), its consequences were typically more serious, including limb loss and death even in young individuals (OR = 25, 95% CI). Finally, microangiopathy has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from retinal microangiopathy to other more severe manifestations such as myocardial injury, pulmonary compromise and potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathophysiological pathway by which COVID-19 produces thrombosis is not completely clear, the incidence of both arterial and venous thrombosis is increased.

Current research addresses this gap and uses a comprehensive model drawn from the transactional model of stress and the Kahn psychological framework to advance the work of predicting PAPIST19. Specifically, the current research investigates how PAPIST19 is related to job engagement, and emotional exhaustion and how job reattachment mediates the relationship. In addition, we use health support climate (HSC) as a boundary condition in our model, which can weaken the impact of PAPIST19 and enhance the effectiveness of job reattachment in reducing emotional exhaustion and increasing job engagement. To test our model, we collected data in multiple waves from Chinese seaports, where seafarers came to work after the restrictions were lifted in China.

BACKGROUND: For the Spanish General Council of Nursing (the Consejo General de Enfermera de Espa?a), it was essential to have information on nursing workforce conditions and nurses' preparedness to wear protective measures at the pandemic's onset. The coronavirus outbreak was believed to have started in China and rapidly spread as a global pandemic requiring policies and actions for planning emergency healthcare delivery. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Data were collected during April 2020 and covered social demography, working conditions, training, availability of personal protective equipment, and nurses' health conditions, including the impact of COVID-19. FINDINGS: From all national territories in Spain, 11 560 registered nurses from different services completed the questionnaire. Findings indicated that the lack of personal protective equipment was a crucial issue, as well as service planning and organization, and 80.2% reported high or very high psychological impact of COVID-19. Alarmingly, 29.5% of the nurses reported COVID-19 symptoms. Of these 23.3% had been tested, and 30.2% were confirmed as being positive to the virus. The nurses deemed proper preparedness for emergencies and disasters as a significant concern. CONCLUSION: Nurses' responses showed evidence of health services deficiencies as a source of damage to their capacity to provide safe patient care and protect themselves and their families' health. The working conditions of the nurses are at critical levels and are unacceptable. The study results provide evidence regarding the necessity of suitable planning and actions being taken to enable safe patient care and safety for nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Our survey gathered nurses' views at the pandemic's onset. The evidence gathered is being used to advise policymakers and nursing organizations to take actions to control public health risks to populations.

Since January 2016, all endoscopists in the Netherlands have been required to register all ERCP procedures in a nationwide quality registry. This study aimed to evaluate the procedural success rates of ERCP after the implementation of mandatory national registration and to compare these with the ESGE quality performance measures. METHODS This study was conducted with data from a multicenter endoscopy database. Data from 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcome was ERCP procedural outcome. ESGE performance measures that could be evaluated were the percentage of successful bile duct cannulations in patients with virgin papillary anatomy; successful stent placement for a biliary obstruction located below the liver hilum; and complete removal of bile duct stones (< 10 mm). RESULT In total, 5295 ERCPs performed in 11 centers were included for analysis. The overall procedural success rate was 89.1 %. Successful biliary cannulation in patients with a virgin papilla was 90.3 % in nonacademic and 92.4 % in academic centers. The rates of successful stent placement in patients with a biliary obstruction located below the liver hilum were 97.0 % in nonacademic and 98.2 % in academic centers, and of successful bile duct stone extraction were 97.9 % in both nonacademic and academic centers.

Despite of evidence shown that social distancing is effective, lack of adherence still persists in many countries. Therefore, it is challenging to separate the effectiveness of government measures, from social distancing driven by personal initiatives. Theory: It is possible that the output of protective behaviors, such as adherence to protective measures and staying in social isolation, is influenced by individual characteristics, such as personality traits or symptoms of mental distress of anxiogenic nature. We hypothesized that individuals with more expressive symptoms of fear or anxiety would have a more protective behavioral tendency in terms of risk exposure, leaving less home during the pandemic. In contrast, individuals with greater emotional stability, as they feel more secure and with a lower perception of risk, could go out more often. METHOD: A total of 2709 individuals from all regions of Brazil participated in the study (mean age = 42 years; 2134 women). Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between personality traits according to the big five model and Psychopathological Symptoms (BSI). Then, correlation analysis was performed to investigate how people that go out often differ from people that stay at home, in both symptoms and personality traits. Finally, to investigate the predictors for going out usually, we use multiple regression analysis, using gender, marital status, level of education, and personality traits. RESULTS: During the second wave of COVID-19 in Brazil, individuals with higher emotional stability tended to leave home more than those with more expressive levels of anxiogenic dysregulation. These results reinforce the role of both personality traits and psychopathological symptoms in prophylactic behavior during COVID-19 pandemics.

Following PRISMA guidelines we searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for papers up to 28 January 2022 on WMH volume changes using MRI on []2 time-points in adults with sporadic SVD. We classified populations (healthy/community-dwelling, stroke, cognitive, other vascular risk factors, depression) based on study characteristics.

Tanimilast is known to exert prominent anti-inflammatory activity when tested in preclinical experimental models as well as in human clinical studies. Recently, we have demonstrated that it also finely tunes, rather than suppressing, the cytokine network secreted by activated dendritic cells (DCs). This study was designed to characterize the effects of tanimilast on T-cell polarizing properties of DCs and to investigate additional functional and phenotypical features induced by tanimilast. METHODS: DCs at day 6 of culture were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of tanimilast or the control drug budesonide. After 24 h, DCs were analyzed for the expression of surface markers of maturation and activation by flow cytometry and cocultured with T cells to investigate cell proliferation and activation/polarization. The regulation of type 2-skewing mediators was investigated by real-time PCR in DCs and compared to results obtained in vivo in a randomized placebo-controlled trial on COPD patients treated with tanimilast. RESULTS: Our results show that both tanimilast and budesonide reduced the production of the immunostimulatory cytokine IFN- by CD4(+) T cells. However, the two drugs acted at different levels since budesonide mainly blocked T cell proliferation, while tanimilast skewed T cells towards a Th2 phenotype without affecting cell proliferation. In addition, only DCs matured in the presence of tanimilast displayed increased CD86/CD80 ratio and CD141 expression, which correlated with Th2 T cell induction and dead cell uptake respectively. These cells also upregulated cAMP-dependent immunosuppressive molecules such as IDO1, TSP1, VEGF-A and Amphiregulin. Notably, the translational value of these data was confirmed by the finding that these same genes were upregulated also in sputum cells of COPD patients treated with tanimilast as add-on to inhaled glucocorticoids and bronchodilators. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings demonstrate distinct immunomodulatory properties of tanimilast associated with a type 2 endotype and CD141 upregulation in DCs and provide a mechanistic rationale for the administration of tanimilast on top of inhaled corticosteroids.","output":"The PDE4 inhibitor tanimilast shows distinct immunomodulatory properties associated with a type 2 endotype and CD141 upregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The abundance of publications of COVID-19-induced chilblains has resulted in a confusing situation.

Of these, 28 had a thoracic CT-Scan, 31 had blood and urine examinations, 24 had skin biopsies including immunohistochemical and direct immunofluorescence studies, and 4 patients had electron microscopy. RESULTS: COVID-19-induced chilblains are clinically and histopathologically identical to chilblains from other causes.

While we continue learning about this new virus, it is clear that 1) the virus is spread via the respiratory route, primarily by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites, as well as by aerosol formation during invasive respiratory procedures; 2) the airborne route is still controversial; and 3) that those infected can spread the virus without necessarily developing COVID-19 (ie, asymptomatic). With the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections increasing globally, the possibility of co-infections and/or co-morbidities is becoming more concerning.

This military-themed comparative review of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV details their virology and describes them figuratively as separate enemy armies. HIV, an old enemy dug into trenches in individuals already infected, and SARS-CoV-2 the new army, attempting to attack and capture territories, tissues and organs, in order to provide resources for their expansion. This analogy serves to aid in discussion of three main areas of focus and draw attention to how these viruses may cooperate to gain the upper hand in securing a host. Here we compare their target, the key receptors found on those tissues, viral lifecycles and tactics for immune response surveillance. The last focus is on the immune response to infection, addressing similarities in cytokines released.

Focusing on their food-medicine functionality, different ways of using PEFF were studied in a cross-sectional way using two approaches: a bibliographical survey and an ethnobotanical case study in a rural community of Patagonia, Argentina. METHODS: A total of 42 studies were selected for the bibliographical review. The case study was carried out with 80% of the families inhabiting the rural community of Cuyn Manzano, using free listing, interviews, and participant observation. In both cases we analyzed species richness and use patterns through the edible consensus and functional consensus indices. Local foods, ailments, medicines and drug plants were also registered. RESULTS: The review identified 73 PEFF, the majority of which (78%) were native species, some with the highest use consensus. PEFF were used in 162 different local foods, but mainly as fresh fruit. Of the total, 42% were used in a functional way, in 54 different medicines. The principal functional native species identified in the review were Aristotelia chilensis and Berberis microphylla. In the case study 20 PEFF were in current use (50% were native), and consensus values were similar for native and exotic species. These were used in 44 different local foods, mainly as fresh fruit. Only 30% were recognized for their functional value by inhabitants (mainly as gastrointestinal and respiratory treatments). The species with the highest functional consensus were the exotic Sambucus nigra and Rosa rubiginosa, followed by the native A. chilensis, Ribes magellanicum and B. microphylla.

From 2006 to 2020, we reviewed Trypanosoma cruzi (TC) IgG serology results for 1156 patients in our institution. We identified 23 patients (1.99%) who had a positive test. A total of 14/23 (60%) of positive serologies never had confirmatory testing, and 7 of them were lost to follow up. Confirmatory testing, performed in 9 patients, resulted in being positive in 3. One additional case of CD was identified by positive tissue pathology. All four confirmed cases were among patients born in Latin America. While most of the testing for CD at our institution is part of the pretransplant screening, no confirmed cases of CD derived from this strategy. Exposure risk in this population is not always documented, and initial positive results from screening are not always confirmed. The lack of standardized screening protocols for CD in our institution contributes to underdiagnosis locally and in health systems nationwide. Given a large number of individuals in the U.S. with chronic CD, improved screening is warranted.","output":"Experiences with Diagnosis and Treatment of Chagas Disease at a United States Teaching HospitalClinical Features of Patients with Positive Screening Serologic Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective The rapid spread of the COVID -19 pandemic and the high variability of the course of the disease make it essential to search for early predictors of outcome. The objective of our study is to predict severe SARS COV2 pneumonia using early cytometric profiles Material and Methods Prospective and observational study of adults with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted on Emergency Department (ED). We collected epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of every patient until they were discharged or died. Multiparametric flow cytometry (FC) analysis of T-lymphocytes (CD4, CD8, CD4 activated, CD8 activated, na?ve (Tn), central-memory (Tcm), effector-memory (Tem), effector (Te) and Th17 subsets), B-lymphocytes (na?ve, memory, transitional subsets, and assessment of clonality), NK cells, plasmablasts, p-DCs (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), m-DCs (myeloid dendritic cells), basophils, and monocytes (MO1, MO2, MO3, slan+ MO3) was performed on whole peripheral blood collected on EDTA, before immunosuppressive therapy was started. We designed a 7-tube 8-color experimental panel. Cell surface staining of 2  106 cells was performed and at least 500 000 total events were acquired for the assessment of plasmablasts, p-DCs, m-DCs, basophils, and the monocyte subsets; for the study of B, T and NK-lymphocyte populations we acquired at least 100 000 total events (FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences). Severity was assessed on the basis of World Health Organizations (WHO) international 10 level ordinal scale (WHOs) and also according to 4 respiratory status, based on SpO2(peripheral blood oxygen saturation)/FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio (SpFi). SpFi group 1 >452, SpFi2 2: 315-452; SpFi 3 236-315, SpFi 4: <236 (respiratory distress) Results 53 patients were included: epidemiological and clinical data available on table 1. 23 patients (43.39%) arrived to SpFi4 status. WHOs >6 (WHO 6:oxygen by non invasive ventilation or high flow) was achieved by 20 patients (37.7%) Good prognosis (meaning SpFi1 as the worse respiratory status in the follow -up) was associated to cytometric profiles: there was a significant increase in CD3, p-DCs, m-DCs, basophils, monocytes, Tcm, % of lymphocytes and CD3/CD19 ratio whereas there was a significant reduction in CD19, % of neutrophils and % Neutrophils/% lymphocyte ratio. In the SpFi4 group, there was a significant reduction of CD3, p-DCs, m-DCs, plasmablasts and CD3/NK ratio. In patients starting in SpFi group 1-2 in the ED but progressing to SpFi 3-4 during the follow up (27 patients), there was a statistically significant relation with Tn, Te and Tn/Te ratio (Tn/Te ratio <0.717: OR 13.5 (p 0.002, [95% CI 2.552-71.403). Initial SpFi1 patients that evolved to SpFi 3-4 during follow up (10 patients), presented a Tn/Te ratio < 0.717 with an OR 11.556 (p =0.005, [95% CI 2.059-64.853]). Plasmablasts < 0.075 and CD3/NK <5.71, were identified as independent risk factors for SpFI4 during follow up. After multivariable analysis, both variables kept their significance: CD3/NK (OR 11,247, p=0.005) and plasmablasts (OR 12,524 , p=0.004). About prediction of WHOs >6, multivariable analysis showed CD3/NK <5.71 (OR 22,240 [95%CI 2,340-211,342] p= 0.007) and plasmablasts<0.075 (OR 28.635 [95% CI 3,187-257,301] p=0.003). A score (0,1,2) comprising both risk factors, was significantly predictive of SpFI4, regardless of the initial respiratory status, age or days from symptoms onset. In our cohort, only 1/15 (6.7%) patients with 0 points (neither plasmablasts nor CD3/NK score), arrived to SpFi4. However, 10/11 (90.9%) patients with 2 points, reached to SpFi4 respiratory status (C-index = 0.837) Same score was applied to predict WHOs > 6: 90.9% with 2 points progressed to WHO>6 and 0/15 patients with 0 points reached the same goal (C-index = 0.872) An incidental finding of 4 indolent B-lymphoproliferative disorders (2CLL-like MBLs and 2non -CLL-like MBL), was found, and they were associated with older age and progression to death. Conclusions Flow cytometry on whole peripheral blood samples of SARS-COV2 pneumonia patients, collected before corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy, could identify cytometric patterns associated to prognosis. Plasmablasts, mDCs and pDCs levels as well as CD3/NK ratio, are associated to a worse respiratory status, while Tn/Te ratio could detect non-severe patients who will require high-flow oxygen devices during follow up.

METHODS: a rapid review of published and grey literature on COVID-19 pandemic was conducted following predefined eligibility criteria by searching electronic databases, repositories of pre-print articles, websites and databases of international health, and research related institutions and organisations. RESULTS: of 584 initially identified records up to 5 July 2020, 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies (No. 11) used the reproduction number (Rt) as a measure of effect and in all of them areduction of the estimated value at post-intervention period was found. The implementation of lockdown in 11 European countries was associated with an average 82% reduction of Rt, ranging from a posterior Rt of 0.44 (95%CI 0.26-0.61) for Norway to a posterior Rt of 0.82 (95%CI 0.73- 0.93) for Belgium. Changes in infection rates and transmission rates were estimated in 8 studies. Daily changes in infection rates ranged from -0.6% (Sweden) to -11.3% (Hubei and Guangdong provinces). Additionally, other studies reported a change in the trend of hospitalizations (Italy, Spain) and positive effects on the doubling time of cases (Hubei, China) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: results of this rapid review suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive.

OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate human myocardial tissue RAS regulation of the failing heart in the light of current therapy. METHODS Fifty-two end-stage HFrEF patients undergoing heart transplantation (no RAS inhibitor: n = 9; angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor: n = 28; angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]: n = 8; angiotensin receptor neprilysin-inhibitor [ARNi]: n = 7) were enrolled. Myocardial angiotensin metabolites and enzymatic activities involved in the metabolism of the key angiotensin peptides angiotensin 1-8 (AngII) and Ang1-7 were determined in left ventricular samples by mass spectrometry. Circulating angiotensin concentrations were assessed for a subgroup of patients. RESULTS AngII and Ang2-8 (AngIII) were the dominant peptides in the failing heart, while other metabolites, especially Ang1-7, were below the detection limit. Patients receiving an ARB component (i.e., ARB or ARNi) had significantly higher levels of cardiac AngII and AngIII (AngII: 242 [interquartile range (IQR): 145.7 to 409.9] fmol/g vs 63.0 [IQR: 19.9 to 124.1] fmol/g; p < 0.001; and AngIII: 87.4 [IQR: 46.5 to 165.3] fmol/g vs 23.0 [IQR: <5.0 to 59.3] fmol/g; p = 0.002). Myocardial AngII concentrations were strongly related to circulating AngII levels. Myocardial RAS enzyme regulation was independent from the class of RAS inhibitor used, particularly, a comparable myocardial neprilysin activity was observed for patients with or without ARNi. Tissue chymase, but not ACE, is the main enzyme for cardiac AngII generation, whereas AngII is metabolized to Ang1-7 by prolyl carboxypeptidase but not to ACE2. There was no trace of cardiac ACE2 activity. CONCLUSIONS The failing heart contains considerable levels of classical RAS metabolites, whereas AngIII might be an unrecognized mediator of detrimental effects on cardiovascular structure. The results underline the importance of pharmacologic interventions reducing circulating AngII actions, yet offer room for cardiac tissue-specific RAS drugs aiming to limit myocardial AngII/AngIII peptide accumulation and actions.","output":"Myocardial Angiotensin Metabolism in End-Stage Heart Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization, 50% of deaths in European Union are caused by Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), while 80% of premature heart diseases and strokes can be prevented.

This study aims to determine how exposure to information sources, knowledge and behaviours potentially influenced risk perceptions during the 2014C2015 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in Sierra Leone. METHODS: The study is based on three cross-sectional, national surveys (August 2014, n = 1413; October 2014, n = 2086; December 2014, n = 3540) that measured Ebola-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices in Sierra Leone. Data were pooled and composite variables were created for knowledge, misconceptions and three Ebola-specific behaviours. Risk perception was measured using a Likert-item and dichotomised into no risk perception and some risk perception. Exposure to five information sources was dichotomised into a binary variable for exposed and unexposed. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to examine various associations. RESULTS: Exposure to new media (e.g. internet) and community-level information sources (e.g. religious leaders) were positively associated with expressing risk perception. Ebola-specific knowledge and hand washing were positively associated with expressing risk perception (Adjusted OR [AOR] 1.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2C1.8 and AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1C1.7 respectively), whereas misconceptions and avoiding burials were negatively associated with risk perception, (AOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6C0.8 and AOR 0.8, 95% CI 06C1.0, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the complexity of how individuals perceived their Ebola acquisition risk based on the way they received information, what they knew about Ebola, and actions they took to protect themselves. Community-level information sources may help to align the publics perceived risk with their actual epidemiological risk.

Methods: An ecological design was employed for the study. The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Linear regression was used to determine the association between AA density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between AA density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<0.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=0.02).

Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic or prophylactic. Like other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with an IC50 of 5.99 g/L, 1.08 mg/L, 1.77 g/L, and 5.86 mg/L respectively. In summary, several sulfated polysaccharides show potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and can be developed for prophylactic as well as therapeutic purposes.Importance The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world has created a pandemic situation unprecedented in modern history.

To date, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, but various factors can affect its performance leading to false negative results. Hereby we present a patient with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and had multiple negative RT-PCR results over 5 days. A 22-year-old woman presented with fever, dry cough, nausea, myalgia, headache, and mild dyspnea. Eleven days before, she was in close contact with her father who had tested positive for COVID-19. RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed on day 8, 9, and 12 of illness which all came back negative even after she started having a worsening dyspnea and showing an increased lung opacity from radiographic findings on day 11 of illness.

Due to the worsening condition, she was referred to a tertiary hospital where her RT PCR result was positive on day 13 of illness. After 28 days from her first symptom, she was discharged from the hospital with improved symptoms and chest X-ray. As conclusions, in patients with high suspicion of COVID-19, repeat swab tests are mandatory if previous tests were negative.

We developed a network analysis framework based on daily returns from 42 countries to determine systemic stability. Our network is built using the conditional probability of co-movement of returns, and it identifies nodes, network complexity, and edge as potential sources of fragility. We also introduce the concept of measuring flows from one return to another. Then, we use 120-day rolling data to capture the financial system's behavior and create a financial stability indicator. We discover that the contributions of nodes and network complexity to changes in system stability frequently cancel each other out. Edge change may be a determinant of systemic stability. Furthermore, the total flows in the network are highly correlated with the volatility.

Cardiac troponins (cTnT and cTnI) and natriuretic peptides (BNP and NT-pro-BNP) are the preferred biomarkers in clinical practice for the diagnostic workup of AMI, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and other types of myocardial ischaemia and heart failure (HF), while the roles and possible clinical applications of several other potential biomarkers continue to be evaluated and are the subject of several comprehensive reviews. The requirement for rapid, repeated testing of a small number of CBs in ED and cardiology patients has led to the development of point-of-care (PoC) technology to circumvent the need for remote and lengthy testing procedures in the hospital pathology laboratories. Electroanalytical sensing platforms have the potential to meet these requirements. This review aims firstly to reflect on the potential benefits of rapid CB testing in critically ill patients, a very distinct cohort of patients with deranged baseline levels of CBs. We summarise their source and clinical relevance and are the first to report the required analytical ranges for such technology to be of value in this patient cohort. Secondly, we review the current electrochemical approaches, including its sub-variants such as photoelectrochemical and electrochemiluminescence, for the determination of important CBs highlighting the various strategies used, namely the use of micro- and nanomaterials, to maximise the sensitivities and selectivities of such approaches. Finally, we consider the challenges that must be overcome to allow for the commercialisation of this technology and transition into intensive care medicine.

We aim to predict COVID-19 disease course and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making. We propose a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only data in the early phase (two to three weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R(t) was observed and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the infection rate in these two countries. The lockdown in Italy did not further accelerate the speed at which the infection rate decreases. The effective reproduction number has staggered around R(t) = 1.0 for more than 2 weeks before decreasing to below 1.0, and the epidemic in Italy is currently under control. In the US, R(t) significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but afterwards the rate of decrease is substantially slower. If the trend continues after May 1, the first wave of COVID-19 may be controlled by July 26 (CI: July 9 to August 27). However, a loss of temporal effect on infection rate (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (November 19 with less than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.","output":"Survival-Convolution Models for Predicting COVID-19 Cases and Assessing Effects of Mitigation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baculovirus and insect cell culture technologies have mostly been limited to research laboratories for the transient expression of target proteins for drug development purposes.

METHODS: We performed an observational study on 39 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from The Fourth Peoples Hospital of Yiyang, Hunan, China. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate logistic regression model analysis were performed. RESULTS: In the acute phase, the serum levels of SP-D were elevated significantly in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases (mean value  standard deviation (SD), 449.7  125.8 vs 245.9  90.0 ng/mL, P<0.001), while the serum levels of SP-D in the recovery period were decreased dramatically than that in the acute phase (mean value  SD, 129.5  51.7 vs 292.9  130.7 ng/ml, P<0.001), and so were for the stratified patients. The chest CT imaging scores were considerably higher in the severe group compared with those in the mild group (median value, 10.0 vs 9.0, P = 0.011), while markedly lower in the recovery period than those in the acute phase (median value, 2.0 vs 9.0, P<0.001), and so were for the stratified patients. ROC curve analysis revealed that areas under the curve of lymphocyte counts (LYM), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and SP-D for severe COVID-19 were 0.719, 0.833, 0.817, 0.837, and 0.922, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the SP-D levels were negatively correlated with LYM (r = ? 0.320, P = 0.047), while positively correlated with CRP (r = 0.658, P<0.001), IL-6 (r = 0.471, P = 0.002), the duration of nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative (r = 0.668, P<0.001), chest CT imaging score on admission (r = 0.695, P<0.001) and length of stay (r = 0.420, P = 0.008).

METHODS: We used multiple imputation and negative binomial regression to estimate population age- and sex-specific admission rates over time.We used a log-binomial model to investigate trends in risk of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 32,814 adult medical admissions during Q4.2012-Q3.2019, HIV status was recorded for 75.6%. HIV-positive admissions decreased substantially between 2012 and 2019. After imputation for missing data, HIV positive admissions were highest in Q3.2013 (173 per 100,000 adult Blantyre residents) and lowest in Q3.2019 (53 per 100,000 residents). An estimated 10,818 fewer than expected people living with HIV (PLHIV) (95%CI 10,068-11,568) were admitted during 2012-2019 compared to the counterfactual situation where admission rates stayed the same throughout this period.

With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywordscdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgovwhile eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. RESULTS: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each.

In this study, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated as 6D10 and 4F10, which were directed against the N protein of IBV using the whole viral particles as immunogens. Both of the mAbs do not cross react with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and subtype H9 avian influenza virus (AIV). After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 6D10 and 4F10, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences (242)FGPRTK(247) and (195)DLIARAAKI(203), respectively, in the IBV N protein. Alignments of amino acid sequences from a large number of IBV isolates indicated that the two epitopes, especially (242)FGPRTK(247), were well conserved among IBV strains. This conclusion was further confirmed by the relationships of 18 heterologous sequences to the 2 mAbs.

We tested the effect of offering lower-energy swaps with and without physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) information on the energy of lunches pre-ordered in an online hypothetical workplace canteen. METHODS: UK employed adults (n = 2,150) were invited to hypothetically pre-order their lunch from the canteen through a custom-made online platform. They were randomised 1:1:1 to: (i) control: no swaps offered; (ii) lower-energy swaps offered; or (iii) lower-energy swaps offered with PACE information. The primary outcome was the total energy ordered using analysis of covariance and controlling for the energy content of the initial items ordered. Secondary outcomes were swap acceptance rate and intervention acceptability. RESULTS: Participants were 54% female, had a mean age of 36.8 (SD = 11.6) and a BMI of 26.3 (SD = 5.6). Compared with an average 819 kcal energy ordered in the control, both the swaps and swaps + PACE interventions significantly reduced average energy ordered by 47 kcal (95% CI: -82 to -13, p = 0.003) and 66 kcal (95% CI: -100 to -31, p < 0.001), respectively. Compared with offering swaps only, the swaps + PACE intervention led to significantly higher swap acceptance (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.27 to 2.09, p < 0.001) but did not significantly reduce energy ordered (-19 kcal, 95% CI: -53 to 16, p = 0.591). About 65% and 16% of intervention participants found the swap interventions acceptable and unacceptable, respectively, with the swaps + PACE intervention being considered more acceptable than swaps only (OR: 1.32, 95%CI: 1.09 to 1.60, p < 0.004). CONCLUSION: Offering lower-energy swaps with or without PACE information reduced the energy of pre-ordered lunches experimentally.

Such information can help reduce or block transmission paths of COVID-19 and help infected patients receive early treatment.

In addition, the historical sociodemographic patterns of populations within cities can result in measurable inequities in access to testing between various racial and income groups. To address these pressing issues, we propose a novel test site allocation scheme to (a) maximize population coverage, (b) minimize prediction uncertainties associated with projections of outbreak trajectories, and (c) reduce inequities in access.

Subcutaneous administration may expand outpatient treatment capacity and qualified staff available to administer treatment, but the association with patient outcomes is understudied. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab treatment is associated with reduced 28-day hospitalization and death compared with nontreatment among mAb-eligible patients and whether subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab treatment is clinically and statistically similar to intravenous casirivimab and imdevimab treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study evaluated high-risk outpatients in a learning health system in the US with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms from July 14 to October 26, 2021, who were eligible for mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. A nontreated control group of eligible patients was also studied. EXPOSURES: Subcutaneous injection or intravenous administration of the combined single dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 28-day adjusted risk ratio or adjusted risk difference for hospitalization or death. Secondary outcomes included 28-day adjusted risk ratios and differences in hospitalization, death, a composite end point of emergency department admission and hospitalization, and rates of adverse events. Among 1959 matched adults with mild to moderate COVID-19, 969 patients (mean [SD] age, 53.8 [16.7] years; 547 women [56.4%]) who received casirivimab and imdevimab subcutaneously had a 28-day rate of hospitalization or death of 3.4% (22 of 653 patients) compared with 7.0% (92 of 1306 patients) in nontreated controls (risk ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.80; P = .002). Among 2185 patients treated with subcutaneous (n = 969) or intravenous (n = 1216; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [16.6] years; 672 women [54.4%]) casirivimab and imdevimab, the 28-day rate of hospitalization or death was 2.8% vs 1.7%, which resulted in an adjusted risk difference of 1.5% (95% CI, ?0.6% to 3.5%; P = .16). Among all infusion patients, there was no difference in intensive care unit admission (adjusted risk difference, 0.7%; 95% CI, ?3.5% to 5.0%) or need for mechanical ventilation (adjusted risk difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, ?5.8% to 5.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of high-risk outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms, subcutaneously administered casirivimab and imdevimab was associated with reduced hospitalization and death when compared with no treatment.

It has done so by raising awareness of the concept, the methods used to calculate estimates and their potential implications and uses in policymaking. The BoD approach is a systematic and scientific effort to quantify and compare the magnitude of health loss due to different diseases, injuries, and risk factors with estimates produced by demographic characteristics and geographies for specific points in time. Not all countries have the resources to undertake such work, and may therefore start with a more restricted objective, e.g., a limited number of diseases, or the use of simple measures of population health such as disease prevalence or life expectancy. The main objective to develop these recommendations was to facilitate those countries planning to start a national burden of disease study. RESULTS: These recommendations could be considered as minimum requirements for those countries planning to start a BoD study and includes following elements: (1) Define the objectives of a burden of disease study within the context of your country, (2) Identify, communicate and secure the benefits of performing national burden of disease studies, (3) Secure access to the minimum required data sources, (4) Ensure the minimum required capacity and capability is available to carry out burden of disease study, (5) Establish a clear governance structure for the burden of disease study and stakeholder engagement/involvement, (6) Choose the appropriate methodological approaches and (7) Knowledge translation. These were guided by the results from our survey performed to identify the needs of European countries for BoD studies, a narrative overview from four European countries (Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands and Scotland) and the summary of a comparative study of country health profiles with national health statistics.

It is associated with impaired postural and core stability. So far, centre of pressure (CoP) measures have been commonly recorded through the use of a force plate in order to assess postural stability. However, this approach provides limited information about the centre of mass (CoM) movement in the lumbar region in individuals with LBP. Recent developments in sensor technology enable measurement of the trunk motion which could provide additional information on postural sway. However, the question remains as to whether CoM measures would be more sensitive in discriminating individuals with mild and moderate back pain than traditional CoP analyses. This study aims to investigate the sensitivity of CoP and CoM measures under varied stable, metastable and unstable testing conditions in healthcare workers, and their relationship with the level of subjective reported back pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a cross-sectional controlled laboratory study. A group of 90 healthcare professionals will be recruited from rehabilitation centres within local areas. Participants will complete the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. The primary outcome will be the rate of their back pain on the 0C10 Low Back Pain Scale (1C3 mild pain and 4C6 moderate pain). Secondary outcomes will include variables of postural and core stability testing during bipedal and one-legged stance on a force plate, a foam mat placed on the force plate, and a spring-supported platform with either eyes open or eyes closed. Both CoP using the posturography system based on a force plate and CoM using the inertial sensor system placed on the trunk will be simultaneously measured.

It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future generations.","output":"The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the year 2021, China's economy continues to recover and moves towards policy normalisation.

It is an important consequence of the aging adult population, generating a plethora of spine-related interventions with variable treatment efficacy and consistently high costs. Recent years have witnessed more than a threefold increase in the prevalence and treatment of ASD, and further increases over the coming decades are expected with the growing elderly population worldwide. The ability to monitor and assess clinical outcomes has not kept pace with these developments. This paper addresses the pressing need to provide a set of common outcome metrics for this growing group of patients with back pain and other disabilities due to an adult spinal deformity. METHODS: The standard outcome set was created by a panel with global representation, using a thorough modified Delphi procedure. The three-tiered outcome hierarchy (Porter) was used as a framework to capture full cycle of care. The standardized language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) was used. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on a core set of 25 WHO-ICF outcome domains (What to measure); on the accompanying globally available clinician and patient reported measurement instruments and definitions (How to measure), and on the timing of the measurements (When to measure). The current work has brought to light domains not routinely reported in the spinal literature (such as pulmonary function, return to work, social participation), and domains for which no adequate instruments have yet been identified (such as how to clinically quantify in routine practice lumbar spinal stenosis, neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, and loss of lower extremity motor function). CONCLUSION: A standard outcome set was developed for patients undergoing treatment for adult spinal deformity using globally available outcome metrics. The current framework can be considered a reference for further work, and may provide a starting point for routine methodical and systematic monitoring of outcomes. Post-COVID e-health may accelerate the routine capture of these types of data.

Methods: We evaluated if the relationship between preoperative OCTA of the choroidal capillary density (CCD) and visual outcome continued over long-term visual recovery in 38 patients undergoing craniopharyngioma resection. Patients were evaluated 3 times: 1 week before surgery (Visit1), followed-up at 6C10 weeks (Visit2), and 9C15 months (Visit3) after surgery. Results: In total 38 patients (70 eyes) with craniopharyngiomas, which included 20 (52.6%) boys and 18 (47.4%)girls, the mean age was 11.8  2.7 years (range: 6C18 years). The age (p = 0.71), gender (p = 1.00), mean refractive error (p = 0.55), and axial length (p = 0.23) of 38 normal volunteers (76 eyes) were matched. After surgery, the cross-compression of patients was relieved. The average visual acuity change in the normal CCD group was 0.07  0.02; the average visual acuity change in the low CCD group was 0.01  0.01, p < 0.001. Preoperative CCD value is related to the preoperative BCVA (p < 0.001), and the visual function after the long-term follow-up (9C15 months) (p < 0.001). The prognosis of CCD has the same trend as the BCVA. Further correlation analysis shows that CCD and BCVA are significantly correlated (r = 0.878; p < 0.001). CCD has a weak but significant correlation both with MD (r = 0.19; p < 0.001) and PSD (r = ?0.21; p <0.001). A natural cutoff of CCD is approximately 38%. With the normal CCD group the maximum improvement of BCVA exceeds 0.3 post-operatively, compared to eyes in the low CCD group that improve by <0.03, and worse after surgery. Conclusions: Long-term vision recovery after surgical decompression of craniopharyngiomas in children can be predicted by preoperative by OCTA. Patients with normal CCD before surgery showed a tendency to improve vision; this trend of improvement persisted in subsequent follow-ups.

OBJECTIVE We examined the effectiveness of exercise training on improving fear-avoidance beliefs. METHODS A systematic review (data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and metaanalysis of randomised controlled/clinical trials of exercise training in adults versus relevant nonexercise comparators that quantified fear-avoidance was conducted. RESULTS After screening 4603 identified records, 17 (2014 participants) and 13 (1152 participants) studies were eligible for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Pairwise meta-analysis showed exercise training was more effective than all non-exercise comparators (standardised mean difference (SMD) [95% CI] - 0.378 [- 0.623, - 0.133], P = 0.002, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE]: very low) for reducing fear-avoidance. Exercise training was more effective than true control for reducing fear avoidance (- 0.407 [- 0.750, - 0.065], P = 0.020, GRADE: very low), however it was not more effective than other interventions (- 0.243 [- 0.614, 0.128], P = 0.199, GRADE: very low). In people with low back pain, exercise training was more effective than non-exercise comparator groups for reducing fear-avoidance (- 0.530 [- 0.755, - 0.304], P < 0.001, GRADE: very low). For individuals with neck pain, exercise training was not more effective than non-exercise comparator groups for reducing fear-avoidance (0.061 [- 0.360, 0.482], P = 0.777, GRADE: very low). CONCLUSION There is very low to low-quality evidence that exercise training is effective for reducing fear-avoidance, including in people with low back pain. Exercise training may be more effective than no intervention for reducing fear avoidance, but there is very low-quality evidence that non-exercise interventions are as effective as exercise for fear avoidance.

However, they represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with variable risk. Identification of vulnerable subgroups is important for prioritization of vaccination strategies and possible early therapeutic intervention after infection. Methods: Tumor pts. with PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the multicentric ADHOK registry by 22 institutions. Detailed information about tumor disease and treatment, as well as routine laboratory parameters determined at least 10 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, was collected retrospectively. The primary endpoint was defined as the outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, graded according to the WHO: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, critical, and COVID-19-related death. Results: Until Feb. 5, 2021, 215 pts. (67% with solid tumors, 33% with hematological neoplasms) were included in the registry. 74% of the pts. had an active malignancy. The course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was rather variable: 66% of the pts. remained asymptomatic or showed a mildto- moderate course, while the rest developed severe or critical disease. The COVID-19-related mortality rate was 24%. Pre-infection routine laboratory values were available for 104 pts., obtained at a median of 21 days before SARSCoV- 2 infection. Compared to COVID-19 survivors, COVID-19 non-survivors showed significantly higher median levels of absolute neutrophil count (ANC: 3.6 vs. 6.4 /nL;p = 0.006, n = 91), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR: 2.2 vs. 7.2;p = 0.005, n = 75), C-reactive protein (CRP: 9.9 vs. 42.0 mg/L;p = 0.001, n = 104), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 213.0 vs. 267.0 U/L;p = 0.016, n = 78). When categorized by a median split, COVID-19 mortality was significantly higher in pts. with ANC &gt; 4.4 /nL (4% vs. 55%, p &lt; 0.001), NLR &gt; 4.1 (5% vs. 58%, p &lt; 0.001), CRP &gt; 15.4 mg/L (18% vs. 46%, p = 0.003), LDH &gt; 236 U/L (15% vs. 49%, p = 0.003) and lymphocytes &lt; 1.3 /nL (41% vs. 11% p = 0.002).

Here, we evaluated viral spread in golden Syrian hamsters to define the impact of temporal and environmental conditions on the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the air. Our data show that exposure periods as brief as one hour are sufficient to support robust transmission. However, the timing after infection is critical for transmission success, with the highest frequency of transmission to contacts occurring at times of peak viral load in the donor animals. Relative humidity and temperature had no detectable impact on transmission when exposures were carried out with optimal timing. However, contrary to expectation, trends observed with sub-optimal exposure timing suggest improved transmission at high relative humidity or high temperature. In sum, among the conditions tested, our data reveal the timing of exposure to be the strongest determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission success and implicate viral load as an important driver of transmission.","output":"Timing of exposure is critical in a highly sensitive model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic can affect the elderly populations general health.

APPROACH & RESULTS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong. COVID-19 patients between 23 January 2020 and 1 January 2021 were identified. Patients with hepatitis C or no hepatitis B surface antigen results were excluded. The primary outcome was mortality. Acute liver injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &#8805;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) (i.e. 80U/L), with total bilirubin &#8805;2xULN (i.e. 2.2mg/dL) and/or international normalized ratio &#8805;1.7. Of 5,639 patients included, 353 (6.3%) and 359 (6.4%) had current and past HBV infection, respectively. Compared to patients without known HBV exposure, current HBV-infected patients were older, and more likely to have cirrhosis. Past HBV-infected patients were the oldest, and more had diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At a median follow-up of 14 (9-20) days, 138 (2.4%) patients died; acute liver injury occurred in 58 (1.2%), 8 (2.3%), and 11 (3.1%) patients with no, current, and past HBV infection, respectively. Acute liver injury (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.45, 95% CI 1.52-3.96, P<0.001), but not current (aHR 1.29, 95% CI 0.61-2.70, P=0.507) or past HBV infection (aHR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56-1.46, P=0.681), was associated with mortality.

This study examined diagnostic performance, user acceptability, and safety of nasal self-RADTs, compared to PCR testing. Methods Self-RADT kits were distributed at a public COVID-19 test center in Aarhus, Denmark or delivered to participants. Participants reported test results and test preferences. During enrollment, participants reported occurrence and duration of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity of self-RADT, relative to oropharyngeal PCR testing, were calculated. Results Among 827 participants, 102 showed positive PCR test results.

METHODS: Posthoc analysis of two international, multicentre randomised clinical trials (ISRCTN70332574 and NCT02148692) conducted between 2011C2013 and 2014C2018, in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery comparing the effect of two different positive endCexpiratory pressure (PEEP) levels on postoperative pulmonary complications. TimeCweighted average dynamic driving pressure and mechanical power were calculated for individual patients. A multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for confounders was used to assess the independent associations of driving pressure and mechanical power with the occurrence of a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications, the primary endpoint of this posthoc analysis. FINDINGS: In 1191 patients included, postoperative pulmonary complications occurrence was 35.9%. Median timeCweighted average driving pressure and mechanical power were 140 [110C170] cmH(2)O, and 76 [51C100] J/min, respectively. While driving pressure was not independently associated with postoperative pulmonary complications (odds ratio, 106 [95% CI 088C128]; p=0.534), the mechanical power had an independent association with the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications (odds ratio, 128 [95% CI 105C157]; p=0.016). These findings were independent of body mass index or the level of PEEP used, i.e., independent of the randomisation arm. INTERPRETATION: In this merged cohort of surgery patients, higher intraoperative mechanical power was independently associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. Mechanical power could serve as a summary ventilatory biomarker for the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications in these patients, but our findings need confirmation in other, preferably prospective studies. FUNDING: The two original studies were supported by unrestricted grants from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC. For this current analysis, no additional funding was requested.

METHODS: We compared five testing strategies: 1) PCR-severe-only: PCR testing only patients with severe/critical symptoms; 2) Self-screen: PCR-severe-only plus self-assessment of COVID-19- consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 3) PCR-any-symptom: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 4) PCR-all: PCR-any-symptom and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 5) PCR-all-repeat: PCR-all with monthly re-testing. We examined effective reproduction numbers (R(e), 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). RESULTS: In all scenarios, PCR-all-repeat would lead to the best clinical outcomes and PCR-severe-only would lead to the worst; at R(e) 0.9, PCR-all-repeat vs. PCR-severe-only resulted in a 63% reduction in infections and a 44% reduction in deaths, but required >65-fold more tests/day with 4-fold higher costs. PCR-all-repeat had an ICER <$100,000/QALY only when R(e) 1.8. At all R(e) values, PCR-any-symptom was cost-saving compared to other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to restricting testing to only those with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations.

The vitreous occupies a large portion of the human eye between the lens and the retina and plays a significant role in vitreoretinal diseases as well as maintaining clarity in the visual field, providing nutrition to the lens, and protecting the eye from mechanical shocks. It comprises four distinct anatomical regions, namely the vitreous core, vitreous cortex, vitreous base, and anterior hyaloid.

Notably, the identified proteome repertoire indicates that the vitreous base might possess additional physiological functions and may not be a passive structure. This study constitutes the most extensive catalog of vitreous base proteins to our knowledge and offers novel insights as a baseline for future studies on the pathobiology of various eye diseases.

Such concerns were exacerbated by more locally confirmed cases of COVID-19, while less salient for manufacturers with high debts (liquidity pressure). In addition, concerns about risks raised in response to early manufacturers resumption of production were found to proliferate overseas, as reflected by the more negative investor reactions seen in 252 US customers of the Chinese manufacturers.

STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric simulation. SETTING: Surgical simulation laboratory. METHODS: An optical particle size spectrometer was used to quantify 1- to 10-m aerosols 30 cm from mastoid cortex drilling. Two barrier drapes were evaluated: OtoTent1, a drape sheet affixed to the microscope; OtoTent2, a custom-structured drape that enclosed the surgical field with specialized ports. RESULTS: Mastoid drilling without a barrier drape, with or without an aerosol-scavenging second suction, generated large amounts of 1- to 10-m particulate. Drilling under OtoTent1 generated a high density of particles when compared with baseline environmental levels (P < .001, U = 107). By contrast, when drilling was conducted under OtoTent2, mean particle density remained at baseline. Adding a second suction inside OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 kept particle density at baseline levels. Significant aerosols were released upon removal of OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 despite a 60-second pause before drape removal after drilling (P < .001, U = 0, n = 10, 12; P < .001, U = 2, n = 12, 12, respectively). However, particle density did not increase above baseline when a second suction and a pause before removal were both employed. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy without a barrier, even when a second suction was added, generated substantial 1- to 10-m aerosols. During drilling, large amounts of aerosols above baseline levels were detected with OtoTent1 but not OtoTent2. For both drapes, a second suction was an effective mitigation strategy during drilling.

Injection of Hepta-ANG1 ameliorates VEGF- and lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular leakage, in keeping with the known functions of Angpt1-Tie2 in maintaining quiescent vascular stability. The new Hepta-ANG1 fusion is easy to produce and displays remarkable stability with high multimericity that can potently activate Tie2.

However, little is known about the causes of premature mortality in the country. To rectify this, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone launched the Sierra Leone Sample Registration System (SL-SRS) of births and deaths. Here, we report cause-specific mortality from the first SL-SRS round, representing deaths from 2018 to 2020. METHODS: The Countrywide Mortality Surveillance for Action platform established the SL-SRS, which involved conducting electronic verbal autopsies in 678 randomly selected villages and urban blocks throughout the country. 61 surveyors, in teams of four or five, enrolled people and ascertained deaths of individuals younger than 70 years in 2019C20, capturing verbal autopsies on deaths from 2018 to 2020. Centrally, two trained physicians independently assigned causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases (tenth edition). SL-SRS death proportions were applied to 5-year mortality averages from the UN World Population Prospects (2019) to derive cause-specific death totals and risks of death nationally and in four Sierra Leone regions, with comparisons made with the Western region where Freetown, the capital, is located. We compared SL-SRS results with the cause-specific mortality estimates for Sierra Leone in the 2019 WHO Global Health Estimates. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2019, and Dec 15, 2020, we enrolled 343 000 people and ascertained 8374 deaths of individuals younger than 70 years. Malaria was the leading cause of death in children and adults, nationally and in each region, representing 22% of deaths under age 70 years in 2020. Other infectious diseases accounted for an additional 16% of deaths. Overall maternal mortality ratio was 510 deaths per 100 000 livebirths (95% CI 483C538), and neonatal mortality rate was 311 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 304C318), both among the highest rates in the world. Haemorrhage was the major cause of maternal mortality and birth asphyxia or trauma was the major cause of neonatal mortality. Excess deaths were not detected in the months of 2020 corresponding to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Half of the deaths occurred in rural areas and at home. If the Northern, Eastern, and Southern regions of Sierra Leone had the lower death rates observed in the Western region, about 20 000 deaths (just over a quarter of national total deaths in people younger than 70 years) would have been avoided. WHO model-based data vastly underestimated malaria deaths and some specific causes of injury deaths, and substantially overestimated maternal mortality. INTERPRETATION: Over 60% of individuals in Sierra Leone die prematurely, before age 70 years, most from preventable or treatable causes. Nationally representative mortality surveys such as the SL-SRS are of high value in providing reliable cause-of-death information to set public health priorities and target interventions in low-income countries.

Downstream, this culminates in natural killer T (NKT) cell activation and cytokine secretion. To determine whether apoE antagonism would protect against septic mortality in mice, apoE-LDLR binding was antagonized using heparin, which can inhibit apoE's LDLR-binding site. METHODS C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and heparin infusion. Serum partial thromboplastin time and alanine aminotransferase were measured at 24 hours, and survival was monitored for 7 days after CLP. LDLR+/+ and LDLR-/- fibroblasts were incubated with apoE and heparin to measure apoE internalization. Hepatic NKT cells and cytokine levels were quantified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS Heparin decreased CLP-induced mortality by 50% versus saline-treated controls, independent of anticoagulation. LDLR+/+ fibroblasts displayed decreased uptake of apoE when treated concurrently with heparin for 12 hours. In septic mice, hepatic alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatic NKT cells, and plasma cytokine levels decreased after heparin treatment. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that heparin protects against septic mortality independent of its anticoagulant effect. This protective effect is associated with the inhibition of apoE-LDLR binding, diminished NKT proliferation and cytokine production, and hepatic dysfunction. These findings indicate a potential clinical role for apoE antagonism in the treatment of sepsis.","output":"Heparin protects against septic mortality via apoE-antagonism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic right colectomy has an established patient benefit.

Multiple studies demonstrated that air quality significantly improved in the U.S. due to COVID19- related travel restrictions. Our objective was to determine whether improved air quality as a result of COVID restrictions was associated with improved semen parameters. METHODS: Semen parameters and deidentified data about male age & geographic location were obtained from a national internetbased sperm banking service. Semen analyses were collected between December 2018 and February 2021. The EPA's Air Quality System database provided county-level data on air quality index (AQI) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). County-level mobility indices were obtained from Google Community Mobility Report which reports changes in travel to parks and to workplaces, plus mobility trends for public transport hubs. For each semen analysis, the average community AQI, PM2.5, and travel were calculated for the 72 days prior to specimen collection - correlating with the total duration of spermatogenesis. March 7, 2020 was used as the date when travel restrictions were initiated. Mann-Whitney U test and multivariate linear regression were used. RESULTS: 718 semen analyses were performed prior to COVID restrictions and 621 after COVID restrictions. AQI improved (33.2 to 28.3) while PM2.5 was relatively stable, and a statisticallyand clinically significant increase was seen in sperm concentration count, and motility (Table 1). In regression, higher sperm concentration and count were associated with improved AQI and lower use of public transportation (p<0.01) while PM2.5, age, and park attendance were not associated with sperm concentration or count. Improved sperm motility was only associated with increased park attendance (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID restrictions have led to a significant decreased travel with improved air quality. Among men utilizing a national internet-based sperm banking service, improved semen parameters were associated with improved local air quality decreased public transportation, and increased park attendance.

Innate immunity, in addition to the adaptive immune system, plays a relevant role in MS pathogenesis. It represents the immediate non-specific defense against infections through the intrinsic effector mechanism immunothrombosis linking inflammation and coagulation. Moreover, decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and prolonged mean transit time (MTT) have been widely demonstrated by MRI in MS patients. We hypothesized that coagulation/complement and platelet activation during MS relapse, likely during viral infections, could be related to CBF decrease. Our specific aims are to evaluate whether there are differences in serum/plasma levels of coagulation/complement factors between relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients (RRMS) in relapse and those in remission and healthy controls as well as to assess whether brain hemodynamic changes detected by MRI occur in relapse compared with remission. This will allow us to correlate coagulation status with perfusion and demographic/clinical features in MS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a multi-center, prospective, controlled study. RRMS patients (1 group: 30 patients in relapse; 2 group: 30 patients in remission) and age/sex-matched controls (3 group: 30 subjects) will be enrolled in the study.

DesignSystematic review and narrative synthesis. Data sourceMEDLINE, Embase, medRxiv, Arxiv and WHO COVID-19 Research Database for studies published from 27 July 2020 to 21 April 2021; existing relevant rapid systematic reviews for studies published between 1 January to 27 July 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selectionObservational studies that included a thorough epidemiological assessment of routes of transmission and which reported on the likelihood of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a distance greater than two metres in indoor community settings. Data extraction and synthesisData extraction was completed by one reviewer and independently checked by a second reviewer. Primary outcomes were COVID-19 infections via airborne transmission over distances greater than two metres and any factors that may have modified transmission risk. Included studies were rated using a quality criteria checklist (QCC) for primary research and certainty of key outcomes was determined using GRADE. Narrative synthesis was themed by setting. ResultsOf the 3,780 articles screened for inclusion, 15 publications reporting on 13 epidemiological investigations were included (three high, six medium and four low quality). Airborne transmission at distances greater than two metres was likely to have occurred for some or all transmission events in 12 studies and was unclear in one study (GRADE: very low certainty). In all studies, one or more factors plausibly increased the likelihood of long-distance airborne transmission occurring, particularly insufficient air replacement (GRADE: very low certainty), recirculating air flow (GRADE: very low certainty) and singing (GRADE: very low certainty). In nine studies, the primary cases were reported as being asymptomatic, presymptomatic or around symptom onset at the time of transmission. ConclusionThis rapid systematic review found evidence of long-distance airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor community settings and identified factors that likely contributed to this transmission in all included studies. These results strengthen the need for adequate mitigation measures in indoor community settings, particularly adequate ventilation with fresh air, and caution required with the use of recirculating air flow systems.

The aim of this study is to describe a novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) to prioritize patients who require surgery during the new normal state of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: A consensus study using the Delphi technique was carried out among clinicians from the Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Anaesthesia departments. Three rounds of consensus were carried out via survey and Webinar discussions. RESULTS: A 50-points score system consisting of 4 domains with 4 subdomains was formed. The CCTS were categorized into the hospital capacity, patient factors, disease severity, and surgery complexity domains. A score between 30 and 50 points indicated that the proposed operation should proceed without delay. A score of less than 20 indicates that the proposed operation should be postponed. A score between 20 and 29 indicates that the surgery falls within a grey area where further discussion should be undertaken to make a joint justification for approval of surgery. CONCLUSION: This study is a proof of concept for the novel CCTS scoring system to prioritize surgeries to meet the rapidly changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers a simple and objective method to stratify patients who require surgery and allows these complex and difficult decisions to be unbiased and made transparently among surgeons and hospital administrators.","output":"A novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) for prioritization of spinal surgeries in the new normal state\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has been profound and unprecedented with suspension of most elective surgeries.

Yet, a gold standard procedure for the repair is still lacking today. There is an increasing evidence that mesh could be advantageous compared to suture repair in lowering recurrence rates. An additional important question remains with regard to the optimal anatomical positioning of the mesh. We hypothesize that the use of an onlay mesh in small umbilical hernia defects can reduce recurrence rates without increasing the complications compared to a simple suture repair. METHODS: A prospective, national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing a standardized 4  4 cm onlay mesh to a conventional suture repair will be conducted. A total of 288 patients with a primary elective umbilical hernia  2 cm from 7 participating Swedish surgical centers will be enrolled. Intraoperative randomization will take place using a centralized web-based system resulting in total allocation concealment. Stratification will be done by surgical site and by defect size. Trial participants and follow-up clinical surgeons will be blinded to the assigned allocation. The primary outcome assessed will be postoperative recurrence at 1 and 3 years. Secondary outcomes assessed will be postoperative complications at 30 days and pain 1 year after surgery. DISCUSSION: Currently, there has been no randomized clinical trial comparing the recurrence rates between an onlay mesh repair and a simple suture repair for small umbilical hernia defects. How to best repair a small umbilical hernia continues to be debated. This trial design should allow for a good assessment of the differences in recurrence rate due to the large sample size and the adequate follow-up. Surgeons concerns surrounding optimal anatomical positioning and fear for larger required dissections are understandable. A small onlay mesh may become an easy and safe method of choice to reduce recurrence rates. Guidelines for small umbilical hernia repairs have stressed the need for reliable data to improve treatment recommendations. We can expect that this trial will have a direct implication on small umbilical hernia repair standards. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04231071. Registered on 31 January 2020.

Serological tests are acknowledged to have high sensitivity, but issues due to cross-reactions with other parasites, native parasite antigen supply and intrinsic test variability do occur. Assays based on recombinant antigens could represent an improvement. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of two novel immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the recombinant antigens NIE/SsIR for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. METHODS This was a retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. We included serum samples collected from immigrants from strongyloidiasis endemic areas for whom there was a matched result for Strongyloides stercoralis on agar plate culture and/or PCR assay, or a positive microscopy for S. stercoralis larvae. For the included samples, results were also available from an in-house indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a commercial (Bordier ELISA; Bordier Affinity Products SA) ELISA. We excluded: (i) samples with insufficient serum volume; (ii) samples from patients treated with ivermectin in the previous 6 months; and (iii) sera from patients for whom only routine coproparasitology was performed after formol-ether concentration, if negative for S. stercoralis larvae. The performance of the novel assays was assessed against: (i) a primary reference standard, with samples classified as negative/positive on the basis of the results of fecal tests; (ii) a composite reference standard (CRS), which also considered patients to be positive who had concordant positive results for the IFAT and Bordier ELISA or with a single \\"high titer\\" positive result for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA. Samples with a single positive test, either for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA, at low titer, were considered to be \\"indeterminate,\\" and analyses were carried out with and without their inclusion. RESULTS When assessed against the primary reference standard, the sensitivities of the IgG and IgG4 ELISAs were 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88-97%) and 81% (95% CI: 74-87%), respectively, and the specificities were 91% (95% CI: 88-95%) and 94% (95% CI: 91-97%), respectively. When tested against the CRS, the IgG ELISA performed best, with 78% sensitivity (95% CI: 72-83%) and 98% specificity (95% CI: 96-100%), when a cut-off of 0.675 was applied and the indeterminate samples were excluded from the analysis.

AIM The study presents a single-center experience and learning curve of thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal (distal) fistula. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 2012 to 2014, 10 consecutive patients with esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal fistula were treated thoracoscopically in our center. There were 8 girls and 2 boys. Mean gestational age was 36.5 weeks and mean weight was 2230 g. Four children had associated anomalies. The surgery was performed after stabilization of the patient between the first and fourth day after birth. Five patients required intubation before surgery for respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy was not performed before the operation. RESULTS In 8 patients, the endoscopic approach was successfully used thoracoscopically, while in 2 patients conversion to an open thoracotomy was necessary. In all patients except 1, the anastomosis was patent, with no evidence of leak. One patient demonstrated a leak, which did not resolve spontaneously, necessitating surgical repair. In long-term follow-up, 1 patient required esophageal dilatation of the anastomosis. All patients are on full oral feeding.

While posing significant challenges for residents, the pressures of the pandemic also spurred accelerated innovation in graduate medical education that will likely have positive impacts for future learners. Insight from the Field Our team explores how residents experienced the crisis through two critical components of well-being and career longevity: burnout and adaptation. While residents perceived burnout increased throughout the pandemic, many EM residents exhibited high levels of adaptation, which enabled them to continue honing their clinical skills and providing high quality care for patients.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune response remain unclear, and little is known about its features compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile longitudinally collected PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in six individuals immunized with CoronaVac and compared these to the profiles of COVID-19 infected patients from a Single Cell Consortium. Both inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection drove changes in immune cell type proportions, caused B cell activation and differentiation, and induced the expression of genes associated with antibody production in the plasma. The inactivated vaccine and SARS-COV-2 infection also caused alterations in peripheral immune activity such as interferon response, inflammatory cytokine expression, innate immune cell apoptosis and migration, effector T cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity, however, the magnitude of change was greater in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease, than in immunized individuals. Further analyses revealed a distinct peripheral immune cell phenotype associated with CoronaVac immunization (HLA class II upregulation and IL21R upregulation in naive B cells) versus SARS-CoV-2 infection (HLA class II downregulation and IL21R downregulation in naive B cells severe disease). There were also differences in the expression of important genes associated with proinflammatory cytokines and thrombosis. In conclusion, this study provides a single-cell atlas of the systemic immune response to CoronaVac immunization and reveals distinct immune responses between inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of individuals receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccines reveals distinct immunological responses between vaccine and natural SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A generalized version of fractional models is introduced for the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of isolation and quarantine.

Drug plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Blood pressure and 12-lead ECG were measured in supine position. Adverse events were also recorded. Results: Aripiprazole decreased diastolic blood pressure on the first day and decreased QTc on the third and fifth day. Olanzapine had a systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and QTc lowering effect on the first day. Polymorphisms in ADRA2A, COMT, DRD3 and HTR2A genes were significantly associated to these changes. The most frequent adverse drug reactions to aripiprazole were somnolence, headache, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, palpitations, akathisia and nausea while were somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, constipation, dry mouth, headache and nausea to olanzapine. Additionally, HTR2A, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, OPRM1, UGT1A1 and CYP1A2 polymorphisms had a role in the development of adverse drug reactions.

It was hypothesised that the implementation of a teaching programme may result in improved medical care for residents. By understanding the enablers and barriers to implementing teaching, we hoped to identify the components of a successful teaching programme. Four care homes in Enfield received training on topics such as deterioration recognition over a 1-year period. The project was evaluated at 3, 6 and 9 months. Each evaluation comprised: pre-and-post-teaching questionnaires, focus groups, analysis of percentages of staff trained, review of overall and potentially avoidable, hospital admission rates. A PlanCDoCStudyCAct cycle structure was used. The programme was well-received by carers, who gave examples of application of learning. Modules about conditions frequently resulting in hospital admission, or concerning real cases, demonstrated the best pre-and-post lesson change scores. However, the reach of the programme was low, with attendance rates between 5% and 28%. Overall, the percentage of staff trained in deterioration recognition ranged from 35% (care home one) to 12% (care home three). Hospital admissions reduced from 37 hospital admissions to 20 over the duration of the project. Potentially avoidable admissions reduced from 16 to 5. Proving causality to the intervention was difficult. Factors facilitating delivery of training included a flexible approach, an activity-based curriculum, alignment of topics with real cases and embedding key messages in every tutorial.

The immunosuppressive therapy used in heart transplant patients, in theory, could reduce inflammation, thus benefitting patients with COVID-19. So far, however, there is still very little literature on this subject. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study. We described laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes from 11 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 assisted at Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology between March and July 2020. RESULTS: Patients with ages of between 35 and 79 years were enrolled, and heart transplantation ranged from 3 to 264 months. The main comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (9/11; 81.8%), hypertension (10/11; 90.9%), and chronic renal disease (6/11; 54.5%). Cyclosporine A was used in 10 (90.9%) patients, mycophenolate mofetil in 9 (81.8%) patients, and mTOR inhibitor in 5 (45.5%) patients. Fever and cough were observed in 8 (72.7%) patients, and dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms in 5 (45.5%) patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 10 (90.9%) patients and thrombocytopenia in 5 (45.5%) patients. The higher level of troponin associated with chest tomography above 50% of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed in those with the worst outcomes. Nine patients needed intensive care, and hospital stay ranged from 4 to 21 days, with 2 (18.2%) patients requiring vasopressor drugs and mechanical ventilation, and three (27.3%) patients dying due to COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSION: Heart transplant patients had similar symptoms and outcomes as the general population; immunosuppressive therapy seems not to have protected them. Patients who presented higher levels of troponin and D-dimer, associated with greater GGO pulmonary infiltrates, had worse outcomes. More studies with larger cohorts may clarify immunosuppressive effects on COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 in heart transplant patients: Case reports from Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers and politicians have regularly expressed their worries about a widening of socioeconomic inequalities in physical and mental health. Debts have been relatively understudied as a specific aspect of socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to poor mental health. This study examines the bidirectional association between debts and common mental disorders (CMDs) in the adult population of the Netherlands. Data were obtained from the second (baseline) and third (3-year follow-up) wave of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a representative cohort of adults. Questions were asked about debts and difficulty in repaying debts in the past 12 months. The answers were combined into one variable: no debts, easy, difficult, and very difficult to pay back debts. Twelve-month CMDs were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. Increasing levels of difficulty in repaying debts predicted onset of CMD at follow-up in those without 12-month CMD at baseline, and persistence of CMD at follow-up in those with 12-month CMD at baseline. Conversely, CMD was not linked to onset of debts at follow-up in those without 12-month debts at baseline, but was associated with persistence of difficulty to pay back debts at follow-up in those with 12-month debts at baseline. These associations remained significant after adjustment for baseline sociodemographic variables, negative life events and physical health. Health professionals and debt counsellors should pay more attention to patients debts and clients mental health respectively in order to refer those with financial or mental health problems to the appropriate services.

However, while leaving two years behind in the pandemic, resources have come to the point of exhaustion in terms of both the economy and the manpower working in the field of health services. Therefore, the need for rapid, simple and accurate tests to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection continues. In this study, it was aimed to compare the performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RAgT) in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) method. In Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine COVID-19 Molecular Diagnosis Laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive respiratory tract samples with viral loads of <25 Ct (cycle of treshold), 25-29 Ct, 30-35 Ct and 35<Ct, a total of 205 patient samples were selected in four groups. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were studied by lateral flow method (LFA) using twelve commercial RAgTs of different companies and their performances were evaluated. In addition, 90 samples were selected from various respiratory tract samples archived, which were sent to our laboratory for the identification of the non-COVID-19 pathogen(s) causing the respiratory tract infection between 2020-2022 and their specificities for RAgTs were evaluated to avoid cross reactivity. The sensitivities of the SARS-CoV-2 RAgTs included in the study, ranged from 40.4-97.5%, while the sensitivity of most of the kits (8/12), at <25 Ct values, was <90%, which is the minimum limit in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)'s guideline for the use of SARS-CoV-2 RAgTs. The specificities of RAgTs were found to be between 90-100%. When the concordance of SARS-CoV-2 RAgTs with rRT-PCR positivity was evaluated with the kappa coefficient, the concordance of only one RAgT was found to be statistically significant (Kappa= 0.88). SARS-CoV-2 RAgTs have a potential use as a diagnostic tool in symptomatic people, as a routine screening tool in community living environments, and in situations such as ending the isolation of the patients.

Methods Exploiting exome sequencing data and 56 CS genes, we performed a gene-based collapsing test between 164 asymptomatic subjects (aged 60 years) and 56,885 European individuals from the Genome Aggregation Database.

Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan crucial for wound healing, has unique affinity for autoantigens (autoAgs) from apoptotic cells. DS-autoAg complexes are capable of stimulating autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production. We used DS-affinity proteomics to define the autoantigen-ome of lung fibroblasts and bioinformatics analyses to study the relationship between autoantigenic proteins and COVID-induced alterations. Using DS-affinity, we identified an autoantigen-ome of 408 proteins from human HFL1 cells, at least 231 of which are known autoAgs. Comparing with available COVID data, 352 proteins of the autoantigen-ome have thus far been found to be altered at protein or RNA levels in SARS-CoV-2 infection, 210 of which are known autoAgs. The COVID-altered proteins are significantly associated with RNA metabolism, translation, vesicles and vesicle transport, cell death, supramolecular fibrils, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and interleukin signaling. They offer clues to neurological problems, fibrosis, smooth muscle dysfunction, and thrombosis. In particular, 150 altered proteins are related to the nervous system, including axon, myelin sheath, neuron projection, neuronal cell body, and olfactory bulb. An association with the melanosome is also identified. The findings from our study illustrate a connection between COVID infection and autoimmunity. The vast number of COVID-altered proteins with high intrinsic propensity to become autoAgs offers an explanation for the diverse autoimmune complications in COVID patients. The variety of autoAgs related to mRNA metabolism, translation, and vesicles suggests a need for long-term monitoring of autoimmunity in COVID. The COVID autoantigen atlas we are establishing provides a detailed molecular map for further investigation of autoimmune sequelae of the pandemic, such as long COVID syndrome.

Although highly specific, SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been shown in clinical practice to be affected by a noninsignificant proportion of false-negative results. This study seeks to explore whether the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation is associated with increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, and therefore may facilitate the identification of false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive adult patients with symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian academic hospital. Immediately after the initial assessment, a lung ultrasonographic evaluation was performed and the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on both clinical and lung ultrasonographic findings (\\"integrated\\" assessment), was recorded. RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection was subsequently performed. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 patients; 107 (46.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of the clinical-lung ultrasonographic integrated assessment were higher than first RT-PCR result (94.4% [95% confidence interval {CI} 88.2% to 97.9%] versus 80.4% [95% CI 71.6% to 87.4%] and 95% [95% CI 89.5% to 98.2%] versus 85.2% [95% CI 78.3% to 90.6%], respectively). Among the 142 patients who initially had negative RT-PCR results, 21 tested positive at a subsequent molecular test performed within 72 hours. All these false-negative cases were correctly identified by the integrated assessment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that, in patients presenting to the ED with symptoms commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation has high sensitivity and specificity for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and it may help to identify false-negative results occurring with RT-PCR.","output":"Lung Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility. METHODS: This is a single-center, hospital-based observational study that included autopsied testicular and epididymal specimens of deceased COVID-19 male patients (n=6) and recruited recovering COVID-19 inpatients (n=23) with an equal number of age-matched controls, respectively. We performed histopathological examinations on testicular and epididymal specimens, and also performed TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry. Whereas, we investigated the semen specimen for sperm parameters and immune factors. FINDINGS: Autopsied testicular and epididymal specimens of COVID-19 showed the presence of interstitial edema, congestion, red blood cell exudation in testes, and epididymides. Thinning of seminiferous tubules was observed. The number of apoptotic cells within seminiferous tubules was significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to control cases. It also showed an increased concentration of CD3+ and CD68+ in the interstitial cells of testicular tissue and the presence of IgG within seminiferous tubules. Semen from COVID-19 inpatients showed that 39.1% (n=9) of them have oligozoospermia, and 60.9% (n=14) showed a significant increase in leucocytes in semen. Decreased sperm concentration, and increased seminal levels of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 compared to control males were observed. INTERPRETATION: Impairment of spermatogenesis was observed in COVID-19 patients, which could be partially explained as a result of an elevated immune response in testis. Additionally, autoimmune orchitis occurred in some COVID-19 patients. Further research on the reversibility of impairment and developing treatment are warranted.

Methods: : This was a single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study that was carried out at a tertiary critical care center in urban Kyoto, Japan. Adult emergency patients hospitalized between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020 were recruited for this study. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors hospital began restricted visitation on March 28, 2020. This study defined before visitation restriction as January 1, 2019, through March 31, 2020, and after visitation restriction as April 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020. We did not restrict emergency services and there were no changes in the hospitals routine, except for visitation restrictions. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for delirium incidence was calculated to compare the before and after visitation restriction periods, and the logistic model was used to adjust for seven variables: age, sex, ward type on admission, primary diagnosis, ventilator management, general anesthesia surgery, and dementia. Results: : Study participants were 6264 patients;median age 74 years (56C83);and 3303 men (52.7%). The total delirium incidence in entire research period was 2.5% (158 of 6264 patients), comprising 1.8% (95/5251) before visitation restriction and 6.2% (63/1013) after visitation restriction. The AOR for delirium incidence was 3.79 (95% CI, 2.70C5.31) after visitation restriction versus before visitation restriction. Subgroup analysis showed no apparent interaction for delirium incidence.

Twenty-five subjects were enrolled in the study and assigned a variable-stiffness shoe, and 19 subjects completed 6-month follow-up. At baseline and follow-up subjects underwent gait analysis in control and variable-stiffness shoes, completed Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaires, and serum COMP concentrations were measured immediately before, 3.5-hours, and 5.5-hours after a 30-minute walking activity. Relationships between changes in KAM (first peak and impulse) and changes in (1) COMP levels in response to the 30-minute walking activity and (2) WOMAC scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients. Changes in first peak KAM were associated with changes in COMP levels 5.5-hours post-activity from baseline to follow-up (R=0.564, p=0.045). Subjects with greater reductions in KAM had larger decreases in COMP (expressed as a percent of pre-activity levels) at follow-up. Subjects with greater reductions in KAM impulse had significantly greater improvements in WOMAC Pain (R=-0.56, P=0.015) and Function (R=-0.52, P=0.028) scores at follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel mHealth smartphone application designed to measure respiratory rates using movement sensors. METHODS: In Study 1, 15 participants simultaneously measured their respiratory rates with the app and a Food and Drug Administration-cleared reference device. A novel reference analysis method to allow the app to be evaluated in the wild was also developed. In Study 2, 165 participants measured their respiratory rates using the app, and these measures were compared to the novel reference. The usability of the app was also assessed in both studies. RESULTS: The app, when compared to the Food and Drug Administration-cleared and novel references, respectively, showed a mean absolute error of 1.65 (SD = 1.49) and 1.14 (1.44), relative mean absolute error of 12.2 (9.23) and 9.5 (18.70) and bias of 0.81 (limits of agreement = C3.27 to 4.89) and 0.08 (C3.68 to 3.51).

Since intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are involved in several host cell signaling and PPI networks, molecular mimicry of the IDPRs can help the pathogens in substituting their own proteins in the host cell-signaling and PPI networks and, ultimately hijacking the host cellular machinery. Thus, the present study was conducted to discern the structural disorder and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) like, molecular recognition features (MoRFs), short linear motifs (SLiMs), and low complexity regions (LCRs) in the experimentally verified mimicry proteins and peptides (mimitopes) of bacteria, viruses and host. Also, functional characteristics of the mimicry proteins were studied in silico. Our results indicated that 78% of the bacterial host mimicry proteins and 45% of the bacterial host mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered while, 73% of the viral host mimicry proteins and 31% of the viral host mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered. Among the pathogens, 27% of the bacterial mimicry proteins and 13% of the bacterial mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered while, 53% of the viral mimicry proteins and 21% of the viral mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered. Though IDPR were frequent in host, bacterial and viral mimicry proteins, only a few mimitopes overlapped with the IDPRs like, MoRFs, SLiMs and LCRs. This suggests that most of the microbes cannot use molecular mimicry to modulate the host PPIs and hijack the host cell machinery. Functional analyses indicated that most of the pathogens exhibited mimicry with the host proteins involved in ion binding and signaling pathways.

Thanks to the usual follow-up teleconsultation within 24 h after their emergency discharge and the introduction of an additional one six days after, the eligible patients are able to return home earlier. This article provides feedback on how teleconsultation helps manage such a crisis. We also present an analysis of the treated population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study includes the cases of 239 patients presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection with a COVID score <4 over a period from 16 March to 11 May 2020. These were patients from the emergency department (ED) or COVID units. We based our analysis on the patient's medical files and an individual survey. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four teleconsultations (with video) and 143 phone calls were carried out. By the end of the teleconsultations, 92.9% were getting better and did not need further follow-up, 5.9% were reconvened to the ED, and 2.5% were hospitalized. No patient died, nor did get hospitalized in intensive care. In total, 95.6% are strongly or rather satisfied with the care provided by teleconsultation and 87.7% of patients are ready to reuse TELE-SCOPE as a means of monitoring in the context of the epidemic.

Due to the magnitude of its harm, it has become a major global public health event. In the face of dramatic increase in the number of patients with COVID-19, the need for quick diagnosis of suspected cases has become particularly critical. Therefore, this paper constructs a fuzzy classifier, which aims to detect infected subjects by observing and analyzing the CT images of suspected patients. Firstly, a deep learning algorithm is used to extract the low-level features of CT images in the COVID-CT dataset. Subsequently, we analyze the extracted feature information with attribute reduction algorithm to obtain features with high recognition Then, some key features are selected as the input for the fuzzy diagnosis model to the training model. Finally, several images in the dataset are used as the test set to test the trained fuzzy classifier. The obtained accuracy rate is 94.2%, and the F1-score is 93.8%. Experimental results show that, compared with the deep learning diagnosis methods widely used in medical image analysis, the proposed fuzzy model improves the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, which consequently helps to curb the spread of COVID-19.","output":"A deep fuzzy model for diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT images()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2020a) states that behavior analysts must provide services based on the published scientific evidence (Code 2.01, Providing Effective Treatment) and maintain competence by reading relevant scholarly literature (Code 1.06, Maintaining Competence). Carr and Briggs (2010) acknowledged several potential barriers that might prevent behavior analysts from pursuing this obligation and offered helpful recommendations for circumventing these barriers. Although the nature of these barriers has primarily stayed the same since the publication of Carr and Briggs, the profession and field have grown more complex over the past decade, and several additional barriers have emerged. Luckily, technological advances and resources recently made available offer additional solutions for behavior analysts to consider adopting. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an update to the strategies described by Carr and Briggs for overcoming barriers related to searching the literature, accessing journal content, and contacting the contemporary literature. In addition, we conclude with how leaders might incorporate the proposed strategies into their organization at a systems-wide level.","output":"Updated Strategies for Making Regular Contact With the Scholarly Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to assess the impact of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave on migraine characteristics METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study conducted on migraine patients previously interviewed during the first Italian pandemic outbreak A second structured telephone interview was conducted between 20 November 2020 and 18 January 2021 We compared migraine characteristics among T0 (before pandemic), T1 (during the first pandemic phase), and T2 (during the second pandemic phase) RESULTS: Among the 433 patients interviewed during the first pandemic phase, 304 cases were finally considered One hundred forty-eight patients had a control visit between March 2020 and December 2020, 120 had an in-person visit, 14 by phone, the remainder used telemedicine software provided by the hospital Frequency of headache, number of symptomatic drugs and headache intensity worsened during T2, compared to T0 and T1, especially in episodic migraine Headache intensity increased relating to the negative emotional impact of the pandemic Migraine management during the pandemic did not influence the clinical outcome CONCLUSION: The prolongation of the pandemic seems to have a negative impact on migraine evolution The arousal and negative psychological behavior toward the COVID-19 outbreak seem to worsen migraine","output":"Migraine during COVID-19: Data from Second Wave Pandemic in an Italian Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today they are more than 167 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development, approximately 138 in preclinical evaluation, and 29 in human clinical trials 1C3 However, the vaccines engineered employing traditional approaches such as inactivated and live-attenuated strains of the virus itself are associated with many downsides, including lengthy time to manufacture, high toxicity, and infectiveness [ ]there is an urgent need to develop new types of vaccine to address these issues 4 Nanotechnology has paved new pathways and provided a new avenue in vaccine development for infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, at an unprecedented speed 5C8 Nanovaccines use nanoparticles as adjuvants or carriers of biological moieties such as DNA, RNA, and recombinant proteins to the antigen-presenting cell 6 In addition, nanovaccines can boost vaccine effectiveness by inducing both humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity) and cell-mediated immune responses 9 Nanoparticles based on cationic lipids and synthetic and natural polymer nanomaterials are being explored to enhance the delivery of the active biological moieties in the next generation of vaccine formulations 10 These novel nanotechnologies have enabled the next generation of vaccine candidates to enter into human clinical trials [ ]naked DNA plasmid and mRNA-based vaccines are easily eliminated by nucleases through the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which makes it difficult to deliver them into host cells in targeted tissues 14 The use of nanoparticles as the vehicle makes it easy to deliver plasmid DNA into the nucleus for the production of encoded antigens or mRNA into the cytoplasm of the targeted host cell to tissues to build immunity against the coronavirus 6 The produced virus-like particles can bind to the same receptors as SARS-CoV-2, limiting possible sites for transmission Other examples of RNA nanotech COVID-19 vaccines include 3LNP-mRNAs BNT162 (Phase 3, BioNTech SE, Fosun Pharma, and Pfizer Inc ), LNP-nCoVsaRNA (Phase 1, Imperial College London), and LNP-CureVac -

Tourism has become the largest employer and most rapidly growing sector in Svalbard, taking over from coal mining. Longyearbyen is a small urban centre but nevertheless is the central hub where almost all tourism passes through. Indeed, tourism is how the majority of human relations with its lands, seas, human and non-human inhabitants will be enabled.
