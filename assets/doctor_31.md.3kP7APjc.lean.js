In this study, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for bovine serum albumin (BSA) at five different concentrations of NaCl (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mM), and five different pH values (2.0, 3.5, 4.3, 7.4, and 9.0). Herein, our aim was to unravel the effects of both pH and ionic strength on the conformations of the serum albumin structure. Our results indicate the effects of physicochemical factors in promoting conformational changes in the albumin structure, unlocking the hydrophobic sequences for hydrophobic drug binding. The BSA structure showed similarity to its native state in the pH range of 4.5 to 7.4 and at various ionic concentrations of NaCl. In the pH range of 3.5 to 4.5, the BSA structure showed denaturation in a controlled manner, which caused significant conformational changes in the molecular position of its hydrophobic amino acid residues. The resultant 3D structure gives insight into the amino acid trajectories. High denaturation and unstable behavior in the structural and conformational changes of the protein structure were observed at pH 2.0 and pH 9.0. We believe that these results and conditions will be helpful in the development of protein-based universal nanocarriers for the encapsulation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.","output":"A molecular simulation approach towards the development of universal nanocarriers by studying the pH- and electrostatic-driven changes in the dynamic structure of albumin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influence of human-care service robots in humanCrobot interaction is becoming of great importance, because of the roles that the robots are taking in todays and future society. Thus, we need to identify how humans can interact, collaborate, and learn from social robots more efficiently. Additionally, it is important to determine the robots modalities that can increase the humans perceived likeness and knowledge acquisition and enhance humanCrobot collaboration. The present study aims to identify the optimal social service robots modalities that enhance the human learning process and level of enjoyment from the interaction and even attract the humans attention to choosing a robot to collaborate with it. Our target group was college students, pre-service teachers. For this purpose, we designed two experiments, each one split in two parts. Both the experiments were between groups, and human participants had the chance to watch the Nao robot performing a storytelling exercise about the history of robots in a museum-educational activity via video annotations. The robots modalities were manipulated on its body movements (expressive arm and head gestures) while performing the storytelling, friendly attitude expressions and storytelling, and personality traits. After the robots storytelling, participants filled out a knowledge acquisition questionnaire and a self-reported enjoyment level questionnaire. In the second part, we introduce the idea of participants witnessing a conversation between the robots with the different modalities, and they were asked to choose the robot with which they want to collaborate in a similar activity. Results indicated that participants prefer to collaborate with robots with a cheerful personality and expressive body movements. Especially when they were asked to choose between two robots that were cheerful and had expressive body movements, they preferred the one which originally told them the story.

A significant backlog of planned elective work has built up representing a considerable volume of patient need. We aimed to investigate the health status, quality of life, and the impact of delay for patients whose referrals and treatment for symptomatic joint arthritis had been delayed as a result of the response to COVID-19. METHODS: We interviewed 111 patients referred to our elective outpatient service and whose first appointments had been cancelled as a result of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Patients reported significant impacts on their health status and quality of life. Overall, 79 (71.2%) patients reported a further deterioration in their condition while waiting, with seven (6.3%) evaluating their health status as worse than death. CONCLUSIONS: Waiting lists are clearly not benign and how to prioritize patients, their level of need, and access to assessment and treatment must be more sophisticated than simply relying on the length of time a patient has been waiting. This paper supports the contention that patients awaiting elective joint arthroplasty report significant impacts on their quality of life and health status. This should be given appropriate weight when patients are prioritized for surgery as part of the recovery of services following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study therefore is to examinetrends of depressive symptomsbefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cohort of older people. Design Observational study with 6-year follow-up. Setting& Participants Over 3,000 community-dwelling adults aged 60 yearsparticipating in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Methods Mixed-effects multilevel models were used to describe trends in depressive symptoms across 3 waves of TILDA; Waves 4 (2016), 5 (2018) and a final wave conductedJuly-November 2020. Depressive symptoms were measured using 8-item CES-D, a score 9 indicating clinically significant symptoms. Results The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms at Waves 4 and 5 was 7.2% (6.5C7.9) and 7.2% (6.5C8.0) respectively. This more than doubled to 19.8% (18.5C21.2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no change in CES-D scores between Waves 4 and 5 (=0.09 (-0.04 C 0.23) but a large increase in symptoms was observed during the pandemic (=2.20 (2.07C2.33)). Age 70 years was independently associated with depressive symptoms (=0.45 (0.18C0.72)) during the pandemic but notfrom Wave 4 to 5 (=0.09 (-0.18C0.36)). Living with others was associated with lower burden of symptoms during the pandemic (=-0.40 (-0.71 - -0.09)) but not between Waves 4 and 5 (=-0.40 (-0.71 - -0.09)). Conclusions& Implications This study demonstrates significant increases in the burden of depressive symptoms amongst older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those aged 70 years and/or living alone. Even a small increase in the incidence of late life depression can have major implications for healthcare systems and societies in general.

It was first identified in Wuhan, China, and has since spread causing a global pandemic. Various studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug repurposing candidates. However, such information is spread across many publications and it is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host interactome exploration and drug (target) identification. CoVex integrates 1) experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs. Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving the virus life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing candidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research systems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to network medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions.

This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS: We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS: Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION: Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Improving access to health care for all workers, including essential workers, is critical to ensure workers' health and workforce stability.","output":"Health Care Access Among Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers, 31 States, 2017-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is an extremely rare event in the natural history of cirrhosis The treatment recommendations include portal pressure reduction strategies including pharmacotherapy with vasoactive agents and beta-blockers and interventional strategies such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement In this report, we present the case of a patient with cirrhosis in whom acute PHG-related bleed was managed with endoscopic band ligation, a therapeutic modality which has not been described in current literature Our decision to re-purpose a technique for variceal bleeding stems from the fact that during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the technical assistance, resource availability, and sourcing of materials that were required for us to follow recommended management guidelines for acute PHG-related bleed was severely affected due to imposed lockdown between districts and states","output":"Managing Acute Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy Bleed During the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic: Novelty or Necessity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study estimated the extent of psychological distress among people losing work during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia, and examined associations between distress, nature of work loss and degree of social interaction. Methods: Data were from a baseline online survey of an inception cohort recruited in the weeks following the introduction of physical distancing and movement restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. These restrictions resulted in widespread unemployment and working hour reduction. Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 scale. Data on nature of work loss, social interactions, demographic, job and occupational characteristics were also collected. Regression modelling was conducted to determine the relationship between work loss, social interactions and psychological distress, accounting for confounders. Results: Among the 551 study participants 31% reported severe psychological distress, 35% in those with job loss and 28% in those still employed but working less. Those who had significantly greater odds of high psychological distress were younger, female, had lost their job and had lower social interactions. The relationship between job loss and distress became non-significant when financial stress, and occupation were included in the regression model, but the protective effect of higher social interactions remained significant. Discussion: There was a high prevalence of psychological distress in people losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN/DATA SOURCES: Using in-person, email, and videoconference exchanges, we convened an interprofessional clinical research group, conducted a literature review of empirical studies, ethics documents and expert commentaries (2010 to present), and viewed traditional and social media posts (March 2020 to May 2020). Stakeholder consultation involved scientific, ethics, clinical, and administrative leaders. SETTING: Clinical research in the ICU. PATIENTS: Patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: While clinical research should be prioritized to advantage patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in order to care for affected patients, it ideally would not unduly disadvantage patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Thus, timely, rigorous, relevant, and ethical clinical research is needed to improve the care and optimize outcomes for both patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019, acknowledging how many studies that are not exclusively focused on coronavirus disease 2019 remain relevant to patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Considerations to continue nonpandemic-focused research include the status of the pandemic, local jurisdictional guidance, capacity and safety of bedside and research personnel, disposition of patients already enrolled in nonpandemic studies, analyzing characteristics of each nonpandemic-focused study, research oversight, and final reporting requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberation about continuing nonpandemic research should use objective, transparent criteria considering several aspects of the research process such as bedside and research staff safety, infection control, the informed consent model, protocol complexity, data collection, and implementation integrity.

We here evaluated the efficacy of casirivimab-imdevimab in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 during the Delta variant surge in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. MethodsWe enrolled 949 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital between July 24, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Clinical deterioration after admission was compared between casirivimab-imdevimab users (n = 314) and non-users (n = 635). ResultsThe casirivimab-imdevimab users were older (P < 0.0001), had higher body temperature ([] 38{degrees}C) (P < 0.0001) and greater rates of history of cigarette smoking (P = 0.0068), hypertension (P = 0.0004), obesity (P < 0.0001), and dyslipidemia (P < 0.0001) than the non-users. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that receiving casirivimab-imdevimab was an independent factor for preventing deterioration (odds ratio 0.448; 95% confidence interval 0.263-0.763; P = 0.0023).

Many microstates are phosphorylation-competent and ensure the phosphorylation of one specific tyrosine. The prevalence of each microstate correlates with its stability. A switch in ligand will lead to a switch in the extracellular domain configuration and to a subsequent switch in the ensemble of microstates.

The majority of these variants are in non-coding regions and their target genes remain largely unclear. OBJECTIVE We sought to understand the effects of these non-coding variants on the development of AD and psoriasis by linking them to the genes they regulate. METHODS We constructed genomic 3D maps of human keratinocytes during differentiation using capture Hi-C targeting more >20, 000 promoters and 214 GWAS variants and combined this with transcriptome and epigenomic datasets. We validated our results with reporter assays, CRISPR activation and examination of patient gene expression from previous studies. RESULTS We identified 118 target genes of 82 AD and psoriasis GWAS-variants. Differential expression of 49% (58) of the 118 target genes occurred in either AD or psoriatic lesions, many of which were not previously linked to any skin disease. We highlight AFG1L, CLINT1, ADO, LINC00302, and RP1-140J1.1 genes and provide further evidence for their potential roles in AD and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS Our work focuses on skin barrier pathology through investigation of the interaction profile of GWAS-variants during keratinocyte differentiation.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Our goal was to identify COVID-19-related stressors that patients associated with worsening rheumatic disease symptoms. METHODS: With approval of their rheumatologists, patients at an academic medical center were interviewed with open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 on daily life. Responses were analyzed with qualitative methods using grounded theory and a comparative analytic approach to generate categories of stressors. RESULTS: Of 112 patients enrolled (mean age 50 years, 86% women, 34% non-white or Latino, 30% with lupus, 26% with rheumatoid arthritis), 2 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients reported that coping with challenges due to the pandemic both directly and indirectly worsened their rheumatic disease symptoms. Categories associated with direct effects were increased fatigue (i.e., from multitasking, physical work, and taking precautions to avoid infection) and worsening musculoskeletal and cognitive function. Categories associated with indirect effects were psychological worry (i.e., about contracting SARS-COV-2, altering medications, impact on family, and impact on job and finances) and psychological stress (i.e., at work, at home, from non-routine family responsibilities, about uncertainty related to SARS-CoV-2, and from the media).

In this study, we assessed the performance of a whole blood C. burnetii IFN?3 release assay in comparison to serological detection in an area of high Q fever incidence in 2014, up to seven years after initial exposure during the Dutch Q fever outbreak 2007-2010. In a cohort of >1500 individuals from the Dutch outbreak village of Herpen, approximately 60% had mounted IFN?3 responses to C. burnetii. This proportion was independent of the Coxiella strain used for stimulation and much higher than the proportion of individuals scored sero-positive using the serological gold standard immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, C. burnetii-specific IFN?3 responses were found to be more durable than antibody responses in two sub-groups of individuals known to have sero-converted as of 2007 or previously reported to the municipality as notified Q fever cases. A novel ready-to-use version of the IFN?3 release assay assessed in a subgroup of pre-exposed individuals in 2021 (10-14 years post exposure) proved again to be more sensitive than serology in detecting past exposure. These data demonstrate that C. burnetii-induced IFN?3 release is indeed a more sensitive and durable marker of exposure to C. burnetii than are serological responses.

Study participants (n = 1176) filled in a two-section online self-administered questionnaire, answering questions regarding demographic and anamnestic data, as well as their intention to accept any vaccination against COVID-19. Some possible reasons underlying VH were investigated as well. An overall hesitancy rate of 14.2% was registered. Data showed how older age, male gender, higher education level, and having been vaccinated for seasonal influenza in 2020C2021 were associated with a significantly higher propensity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. On the contrary, having experienced adverse effects following past vaccinations was a negative predictor. In addition to confirming an array of predictors of VH, we found a worryingly high prevalence of VH among diabetics, who have been shown to be particularly exposed to severe COVID-19 and death. These findings may be useful in planning targeted action toward acceptance improvement and enhancing the efficacy of vaccination campaigns.","output":"Rate and Predictors of Hesitancy toward SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine among Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Results from an Italian Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has developed, concern for invasive fungal infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has emerged.

The study of RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defences in vertebrates is hampered by the overlap with other antiviral mechanisms; thus, heterologous systems are often used to study the interplay between RNA silencing and vertebrate-infecting viruses. In this report we show that the VP3 protein of the avian birnavirus Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) displays, in addition to its capacity to bind long double-stranded RNA, the ability to interact with double-stranded small RNA molecules. We also demonstrate that IBDV VP3 prevents the silencing mediated degradation of a reporter mRNA, and that this silencing suppression activity depends on its RNA binding ability. Furthermore, we find that the anti-silencing activity of IBDV VP3 is shared with the homologous proteins expressed by both insect- and fish-infecting birnaviruses. Finally, we show that IBDV VP3 can functionally replace the well-characterized HCPro silencing suppressor of Plum pox virus, a potyvirus that is unable to infect plants in the absence of an active silencing suppressor. Altogether, our results support the idea that VP3 protects the viral genome from host sentinels, including those of the RNA silencing machinery.","output":"The VP3 Factor from Viruses of Birnaviridae Family Suppresses RNA Silencing by Binding Both Long and Small RNA Duplexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past decade(s), fluorescence microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) have been widely employed to investigate biological and biomimetic systems for pharmaceutical applications, to determine the localization of drugs in tissues or entire organisms or the extent of their cellular uptake (in vitro). However, the diffraction limit of light, which limits the resolution to hundreds of nanometers, has for long time restricted the extent and quality of information and insight achievable through these techniques. The advent of super-resolution microscopic techniques, recognized with the 2014 Nobel prize in Chemistry, revolutionized the field thanks to the possibility to achieve nanometric resolution, i.e., the typical scale length of chemical and biological phenomena. Since then, fluorescence microscopy-related techniques have acquired renewed interest for the scientific community, both from the perspective of instrument/techniques development and from the perspective of the advanced scientific applications.

Loneliness and social isolation are emerging public health challenges for aging populations. Methods. We followed N=11,305 US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants aged 50-95 from 2006-2014 to measure persistence of exposure to loneliness and social isolation. We tested associations of longitudinal loneliness and social-isolation phenotypes with disability, morbidity, mortality, and biological aging through 2018. Results. During follow-up, 18% of older adults met criteria for loneliness and, for 6%, symptoms persisted across two or more follow-up assessments. For social isolation, these fractions were 21% and 8%. HRS participants who experienced loneliness and social isolation were at increased risk for disease, disability, and mortality. Older adults experiencing persistent loneliness were at a 59% increased hazard of mortality compared to those who were never lonely. For social isolation, the increase was 28%. Effect-sizes were somewhat larger for counts of prevalent activity limitations and somewhat smaller for counts of prevalent chronic diseases. Covariate adjustment for socioeconomic and psychological risks attenuated but did not fully explain associations. Older adults who experienced loneliness and social isolation also exhibited physiological indications of advanced biological aging (Cohen's-d for persistent loneliness and social isolation=0.26 and 0.21, respectively). For loneliness, but not social isolation, persistence of symptoms was associated with increased risk. Conclusion.

In addition, the pandemic is shaking up traditional workplace structures and causing employers to rethink how essential tasks can be done, which may broaden their views of workplace accommodations. We assess the potential for the pandemic to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Methods This article analyzes pre-COVID data on disability and home-based work from three representative data sourcesthe American Community Survey, American Time Use Survey, and Current Population Survey. We employ both cross-tabulations and regressions to predict work at home. Results We find that workers with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities both to work primarily from home and to do any work at home. This is true for both employees and self-employed workers. Workers with disabilities face similar wage gaps in on-site and home-based work, indicating that while increased availability of home-based work may create more employment opportunities for workers with disabilities, it is unlikely to erase wage disparities. While workers with disabilities are currently more likely to be working primarily from home, only 34% are in occupations with high potential for home-based work, compared to 40% of workers without disabilities. Conclusions Workers with disabilities are currently more likely to work from home and many may benefit from expanded work-at-home opportunities, but the types of jobs they hold constrain this potential.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines public engagement in crisis communication about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage and the practical strategy of social mobilization to mitigate the infodemic. METHODS: We retrieved the unbiased values of the top-ranked search phrases between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, which normalized the anonymized, categorized, and aggregated samples from Google Search data. This study illustrates the most-searched terms, including the official COVID-19 terms, the stigmatized terms, and other controls, to measure the collective behavioral propensities to stigmatized terms and to explore the global reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic in the real world. We calculated the ratio of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases to the regional population as the cumulative rate (R) of a specific country or territory and calculated the Gini coefficient (G) to measure the collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior. RESULTS: People around the world are using stigmatizing terms on Google Search, and these terms were used earlier than the official names. Many stigmatized monikers against China (eg, Wuhan pneumonia, G=0.73; Wuhan coronavirus, G=0.60; China pneumonia, G=0.59; China coronavirus, G=0.52; Chinese coronavirus, G=0.50) had high collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, while the official terms COVID-19 (G=0.44) and SARS-CoV-2 (G=0.42) have not become de facto standard usages. Moreover, the pattern of high consistent usage was observed in 13 territories with low cumulative rates (R) between January 16 and July 15, 2020, out of 58 countries and territories that have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the scientific literature, multifarious naming practices may have provoked unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing Chinese people. The World Health Organization; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and the media initiated campaigns for fighting back against the COVID-19 infodemic with the same mission but in diverse voices. CONCLUSIONS: Infodemiological analysis can articulate the collective propensities to stigmatized monikers across search behaviors, which may reflect the collective sentiment of backlash against China and Chinese people in the real world. The full-fledged official terms are expected to fight back against the resilience of negative perceptual bias amid the COVID-19 epidemic. Such official naming efforts against the infodemic should be met with a fair share of identification in scientific conventions and sociocultural paradigms. As an integral component of preparedness, appropriate nomenclatures should be duly assigned to the newly identified coronavirus, and social mobilization in a uniform voice is a priority for combating the next infodemic.","output":"The COVID-19 Infodemic: Infodemiology Study Analyzing Stigmatizing Search Terms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Approximately 35% of the North American population and an estimated 90% of the sub-Saharan African population have antibodies against adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) that are capable of neutralizing AdHu5-based vaccines. In mice, intranasal delivery of AdHu5 expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad) containing the genes for the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (ZGP) under the expressional control of a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMV)) can bypass systemic preexisting immunity, resulting in protection against mouse-adapted Zaire ebolavirus (Mayinga 1976). METHODS Guinea pigs administered an adenovirus-based Ebola virus vaccine either intramuscularly or intranasally in the presence of systemically or mucosally induced adenovirus immunity were challenged with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted Zaire ebolavirus (Mayinga 1976) (GA-ZEBOV). The humoral immune response was assayed to determine the effect of vaccine delivery route and preexisting immunity. RESULTS Intramuscular or intranasal vaccination fully protected guinea pigs against a lethal GA-ZEBOV challenge. However, intramuscular vaccination in animals with systemically induced preexisting immunity resulted in low survival following challenge. Interestingly, intranasal vaccination protected guinea pigs with systemic preexisting immunity to AdHu5. Mucosal adenoviral immunity induced by intranasal administration of AdHu5 decreased protection following intranasal vaccination with the first-generation but not with the second-generation vaccine.

Early concerns regarding demand far exceeding capacity were balanced by anecdotal reports of decreased patient visits, including those for specific high-acuity conditions. This study sought to identify changes in ED volume and acuity, within a specific managed care environment, associated with the onset of the pandemic. METHODS: Data from patient visits to 2 San Diego, California, EDs-within an integrated health-care system-were extracted from the electronic health record. Daily patient visits, hospital admissions from the ED, Emergency Severity Index scores, and mode of arrival were compared between two 28-day periods, with the 28 days following a \\"stay at home\\" order issued by the governor of California and a control period of the same dates in 2019. RESULTS: These EDs observed a significant decrease in daily visits (42% compared to the previous year) associated with the pandemic. An increased rate of hospital admissions (16.6%-21.6%) was suggestive of an overall increase in acuity; however, changes in the distribution of Emergency Severity Index scores were less pronounced. The overall number of admissions declined significantly. Although overall ambulance traffic decreased, the proportion of patients arriving by ambulance was unchanged. CONCLUSION: Patient volume in 2 EDs dropped significantly in association with a statewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a shift in acuity as measured by the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital, but overall admissions declined, suggesting sicker patients also did not seek care.","output":"Changes in Emergency Department Patient Volume and Acuity Associated with Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Unique Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we focus on the impact of digital transformation on traditional ways to sell insurance products.

Three methods to detect apoptosis were applied: flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA content, fluorescence microscopic visualization of apoptotic cells labeled by the TUNEL assay, and gel electrophoresis to detect DNA laddering. Apoptosis in A/J and BALB/c macrophages was first detected at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) and reached a maximum by 12 h p.i.

In addition to causing serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and lung failure, there have been conflicting reports about presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and possible implications for the male reproductive tract. SARS-CoV-2 may infect any cell type expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), including reproductive cells. Besides the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the expression of host proteases, such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), is needed to cleave the viral S protein, allowing permanent fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we aimed to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID-19 and male reproduction. The lack of coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testis suggests that sperm cells may not be at increased risk of viral entry and spread. However, the presence of orchits in COVID-19 confirmed patients and compromised sex-related hormonal balance among these patients, challenges reproductive medicine.

Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","output":"Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Survivin is one of the rare proteins that is differentially expressed in normal and cancer cells and is directly or indirectly involved in numerous pathways required for tumor maintenance. It is expressed in almost all cancers and its expression has been detected at early stages of cancer. These traits make survivin an exceptionally attractive target for cancer therapeutics. Even with these promising features to be an oncotherapeutic target, there has been limited success in the clinical trials targeting survivin. Only recently it has emerged that survivin was not being specifically targeted which could have resulted in the negative clinical outcome. Also, focus of research has now shifted from survivin expression in the overall heterogeneous tumor cell populations to survivin expression in cancer stem cells as these cells have proved to be the major drivers of tumors. Therefore, in this review we have analyzed the expression of survivin in normal and cancer cells with a particular focus on its expression in cancer stem cell compartment. We have discussed the major signaling pathways involved in regulation of survivin. We have explored the current development status of various types of interventions for inhibition of survivin. Furthermore, we have discussed the challenges involving the development of potent and specific survivin inhibitors for cancer therapeutics.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of IS patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to non-IS patients. METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study. We included all patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a large multicentre national cohort in Spain, from March 27(th) until June 19(th), 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of in-hospital death among IS compared to non-IS patients. RESULTS: Among 13 206 included patients, 2 111 (16.0%) were IS. A total of 166 (1.3%) patients had solid organ (SO) transplant, 1081 (8.2%) had SO neoplasia, 332 (2.5%) had hematologic neoplasia, and 570 (4.3%), 183 (1.4%) and 394 (3.0%) were receiving systemic steroids, biological treatments, and immunosuppressors, respectively. Compared to non-IS patients, the aOR (95% CI) for in-hospital death was 1.60 (1.43C1.79) for all IS patients, 1.39 (1.18C1.63) for patients with SO cancer, 2.31 (1.76C3.03) for patients with haematological cancer and 3.12 (2.23C4.36) for patients with SO transplant. The aOR (95% CI) for death for patients who were receiving systemic steroids, biological treatments and immunosuppressors compared to non-IS patients were 2.16 (1.80C2.61), 1.97 (1.33C2.91) and 2.06 (1.64C2.60), respectively. IS patients had a higher odds than non-IS patients of in-hospital acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, myocarditis, thromboembolic disease and multiorgan failure.

Some of these non-resolved donations are occult HBV infections (OBIs), which pose potential risk of HBV transmission if they are not deferred. This study is aimed to further analyze these non-resolved donations. Methods: The non-resolved plasma samples were further analyzed by serological tests and various HBV DNA amplification assays including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and nested PCR amplifying the basic core and pre-core promoter regions (BCP/PC; 295 base pairs) and HBsAg (S) region (496 base pairs). Molecular characterizations of HBV DNA+ non-resolved samples were determined by sequencing analysis. Results: Of 17,226 MPs from 103,356 seronegative blood donations, 98 MPs were detected reactive for HBV. Fifty-six out of these 98 (57.1%) reactive MPs were resolved as HBV DNA+, but the remaining 42 pools (42.9%, 252 donations) were left non-resolved with a high rate (53.2%) of anti-HBc+. Surprisingly, among 42 non-resolved MPs, 17 contained one donation identified as OBIs by alternative NAT assays. Sequence analysis on HBV DNAs extracted from these OBI donations showed some key mutations in the S region that may lead to failure in HBsAg detection and vaccine escape. Conclusion: A total of 53.2% of the non-resolved donations were anti-HBc+, and OBIs were identified in 40.5% of these non-resolved pools. Therefore, non-resolved donations with anti-HBc+ might pose potential risk for HBV transmission.

Although several studies have examined agreement between peer and faculty assessments regarding basic life support (BLS), few studies have done so for advanced resuscitation skills (ARS) such as intubation and defibrillation. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the degree of agreement between medical students and faculty assessments of ARS examinations. METHODS: This retrospective explorative study was conducted during the emergency medicine (EM) clinical clerkship of fourth-year medical students from April to July 2020. A faculty assessor (FA) and a peer assessor (PA) assessed each examinees resuscitation skills (including BLS, intubation, and defibrillation) using a checklist that consisted of 20 binary items (performed or not performed) and 1 global proficiency rating using a 5-point Likert scale. The prior examinee assessed the next examinee after feedback and training as a PA. All 54 students participated in peer assessment. The assessments of 44 FA/PA pairs were analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Gwets first-order agreement coefficient. RESULTS: The PA scores were higher than the FA scores (meanstandard deviation, 20.22.5 [FA] vs. 22.32.4 [PA]; P<0.001).

Here we examined 2,323 virus genomes from Alaska and 278,635 virus genomes from the contiguous United States collected between the first week of December 2020 through the last week of June 2021. We focused on this timeframe because of the notable emergence and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.519 observed in Alaska. We found that this variant was consistently detected in Alaska from the end of January through June of 2021 with a peak prevalence in April of 77.9% unlike the rest of the United States with a peak prevalence of 4.6%. In Alaska, the earlier emergence of B.1.1.519 coincided with a later peak of Alpha (B.1.1.7) when compared to the rest of the United States.

Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are small ECG devices placed subcutaneously, to automatically detect arrhythmias in human patients. OBJECTIVES To test ILRs ability to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in horses. Further, we hypothesised that anatomical location of the implant site might influence signal quality. Signal quality was evaluated both during exercise and over time. STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. METHODS In five Standardbred mares, eleven ILRs were implanted subcutaneously in up to three different positions (Front: pectoral region, Left-6: sixth left intercostal space, Ventral: xiphoid region) and AF induced. The R and T wave amplitudes were measured in all positions over time during AF. AF burden automatically registered by the ILRs over a 2-month period were compared with selected Holter ECG recordings. RESULTS All three positions had stable R and T wave amplitudes during the study period and were of sufficient quality to allow AF detection at rest. The position Left-6 showed significantly higher R and T wave amplitudes compared to the other positions. During submaximal exercise only the Left-6 position was able to record ECG signals of diagnostic quality. No position yielded diagnostic signals at maximum exercise due to artefacts. MAIN LIMITATIONS Few horses and ILRs included and no spontaneous AF episodes were studied. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study indicates that ILRs can be used for AF detection in horses, but the anatomical location is important for optimal ECG quality. Despite insufficient quality during exercise, ILRs were suitable for AF detection at rest.

The 3 g and 6 g with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 g with Algel-IMDG or 6 g with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519. FINDINGS: Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 g with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group (1970 [95% CI 1556-2494]) than the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group (1009 [741-1374]; p=00041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (929% [95% CI 882-962] of 184 participants in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (983% [951-996]) of 177 participants in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 925 (95% CI 777-1102) in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group and 1601 (1358-1888) in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (880% [95% CI 824-923]) of 184 participants in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (966% [928-988]) of 177 participants in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 g with Algel-IMDG and 6 g with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group (38 [200%; 95% CI 147-265] of 190) and the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group (40 [211%; 155-275] of 190) was observed on days 0-7 and days 28-35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 399 (95% CI 320-499) in the 3g with Algel-IMDG group, 695 (537-899) in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group, 533 (401-710) in the 6 g with Algel group, and 207 (145-295) in the Algel alone group. INTERPRETATION: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial.

BACKGROUND: Although as a profession nursing generally requires high levels of performance, the disruption arising from an infectious disease outbreak increases the work stress and decreases the performance of front-line nurses. How this situation can be improved has yet to be thoroughly examined. METHOD: We used a snowball sampling technique to recruit 339 nurses who were originally from outside Hubei but volunteered to join medical teams going to Hubei to tackle COVID-19. RESULTS: Drawing on the theory of work as a calling, we found that living a calling had a positive effect on front-line nurses' performance through the clinical and relational care they provided. Perceived supervisor support strengthened these mediated relationships. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that despite the constraints associated with pandemics, front-line nurses who are living a calling are able to provide better clinical and relational care to infected patients, which in turn improves their performance. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The findings of this study suggest that hospitals can introduce career educational interventions to enhance nurses' ability to discern and live out their calling to improve their performance.","output":"Surviving an infectious disease outbreak: How does nurse calling influence performance during the COVID-19 fight?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has caused widespread transmission around the world. As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","output":"Importations of COVID-19 into African countries and risk of onward spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing threats of viral diseases have gained worldwide attention in recent years. Quite a few infectious diseases are still lacking effective prevention or treatment. The pace of developing antiviral agents could be expedited by the availability of quick and efficient drug screening platforms. In this study, quantum dot (QD), an emerging probe for biological imaging and medical diagnostics, was employed to form complexes with virus and used as fluorescent imaging probes for exploring potential antiviral therapeutics. Inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in organic phase were encapsulated by amphiphilic alginate to attain biocompatible water-soluble QDs via phase transfer. Virus employed for this study was dengue virus which is a notorious one in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. To construct a QD-virus imaging modality capable of providing meaningful information, preservation of viral infectivity after tagging virus with QDs is of utmost importance. In order to form colloidal complexes of QD-virus, electrostatic repulsion force generated from both negatively charged virus and QDs was neutralized by various concentrations of cationic polybrene. Results showed that BHK-21 cells infected with dengue viruses incorporated with QDs exhibited bright fluorescence intracellularly within 30 min. To demonstrate the potency of QD-virus complexes as bioprobes for screening antiviral agents, BHK-21 cells were incubated for one hour with allophycocyanin purified from blue-green algae and then infected with QD-virus complexes. Based on the developed cell-based imaging assay, allophycocyanin with concentration of 125 microg/mL led to extremely weak intracellular fluorescence post-infection of QD-virus complexes for 30 min. That is, the efficacy of anti-dengue viral activity of the algae extract was clearly illustrated by the inorganic-organic hybrid platform constructed in current study.","output":"Quantum dots encapsulated with amphiphilic alginate as bioprobe for fast screening anti-dengue virus agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the digital news industry becomes the main channel of information dissemination, the adverse impact of fake news is explosively magnified.

The contrastive learner interacts with the unreliable news classifier to push similar credible news (or similar unreliable news) closer while moving news articles with similar content but opposite credibility labels away from each other in the multimodal embedding space.

The analysis of transmission dynamics is crucial to determine whether mitigation or suppression measures reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study sought to estimate the basic (R(0)) and time-varying (R(t)) reproduction number of COVID-19 and contrast the public health measures for ten South American countries. METHODS. Data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Country-specific R(0) values during the first two weeks of the outbreak and R(t) values after 90 days were estimated. RESULTS. Countries used a combination of isolation, physical distancing, quarantine, and community-wide containment measures to staunch the spread of COVID-19 at different points in time. R(0) ranged from 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.99) in Venezuela to 3.83 (3.04-4.75) in Chile, whereas R(t) after 90 days ranged from 0.71 (95% credible interval: 0.39-1.05) in Uruguay to 1.20 (1.19-1.20) in Brazil. Different R(0) and R(t) values may be related to the testing capacity of each country. CONCLUSION. R(0) in the early phase of the outbreak varied across the South American countries.

Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor and obinutuzumab (OBIN), a CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) are approved for pts with CLL (Fischer, NEJM 2019). Atezolizumab, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), is approved for melanoma, lung cancer and other solid tumors. Preclinical studies showed synergy of VEN and CD20 mAb with CPI (Kohlhapp, Cancer Discovery 2021;Westin, Lancet Oncology 2014). Clinical studies showed activity of PD1 inhibition in pts with Richter's transformation, but not CLL (Ding, Blood 2017;Jain, ASH 2018). To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated PD-L1 inhibition in pts with CLL, nor combined CPI, VEN and OBIN. We hypothesized that combined VEN, OBIN and atezolizumab will be synergistic. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated Phase II trial of combined VEN, OBIN and atezolizumab in pts with previously untreated CLL meeting 2008 IWCLL treatment criteria (NCT02846623). Eligibility criteria included age 18 years, adequate organ function (total bilirubin 1.5 x ULN, ALT and AST 2.5 x ULN, creatinine 1.5 x ULN). OBIN was given at a flat dose of 100mg IV Cycle (C)1 Day (D)1, 900 mg C1D2, 1000mg on C1D8, 1000mg on C1D15 and then 1000mg on C2-9 D1. Atezolizumab was given at a flat dose of 1680 mg IV (split over 2 days) on C1D3-4 and then C2-9D1-2. VEN was initiated at the start of C3 with the weekly dose-escalation (20mg daily to a target dose of 400mg daily) and continued daily until end of C14 (total 12 cycles of VEN). All pts stopped therapy at the end of C14. Response assessments were done with CT imaging and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with MRD assessment (multi-color flow cytometry;sensitivity 10 -4) at the end of C2 (prior to VEN initiation), end of C6, end of C9, and end of C14. Results: From July 2019 to December 2020, a total of 26 pts were enrolled. The median age was 60 years (range, 21-74). The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 19/26 (73%) had unmutated IGHV gene. Though the study did not restrict pts with del(17p) or mutated TP53, no pt in the current cohort had del(17p)/ mutated TP53. A total of 14 (54%) pts had a baseline lymph node >5cm. The median follow-up is 13.3 months. One pt came off study in C1 (details below). A total of 25 pts initiated VEN. The TLS risk categories at the start of C1 were high (n=9, 36%), medium (n=12, 48%), and low (n=4, 16%). After 2 cycles of OBIN and atezolizumab (prior to VEN initiation), the majority of pts had downgrading of TLS risk category [high (n=2, 8%), medium (n=3, 12%), and low (n=20, 80%)]. After C6 (about 3 cycles of VEN 400mg daily), bone marrow undetectable (U)-MRD rate was 19/25 (76%);4/25 (16%) had low+ MRD and 2/25 (8%) had high+ MRD. After C9 (about 6 cycles of VEN 400mg daily), among the 21 pts (4 pts have not reached this time-point), the bone marrow U-MRD rate was 18/21 (86%);2/21 (10%) had low+ MRD and 1/21 (5%) had high+ MRD. A total of 14 pts completed C14 (9 pts have not reached this time-point;2 pts came off study prior to completing C14, details below);13/14 (93%) achieved bone marrow U-MRD and 1/14 (7%) has low+ MRD. No patient had disease progression or MRD relapse so far. One pt died (details below). Three pts came off study (one developed retroperitoneal hematoma after receiving enoxaparin for DVT in C1;one developed CPI-induced colitis and removed from the study in C10;one died from COVID-19 pneumonia in C14 while in bone marrow U-MRD remission). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 14/26 (54%) pts. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 5/26 (19%) pts;no pt had G4 thrombocytopenia. A total of 4 pts developed CPI-induced toxicities (colitis, G3, n=1;mucositis, G3, n=1;nephritis, G2, n=1;myositis, G2, n=1). A total of 10/25 (40%) pts had dose reduction of VEN, the majority due to neutropenia. Atezolizumab was discontinued early in 3 pts due to CPI-induced toxicities. Laboratory correlative studies including scRNAseq and CyTOF are ongoing. Conclusions: Treatment with combined VE , OBIN and atezolizumab leads to high rate of early U-MRD remission with 76% bone marrow U-MRD remission at the end of C6 (about 3 cycles of VEN 400mg daily). Four pts had CPI-induced toxicities. The enrollment in this trial continues and updated data and correlative studies will be presented at the ASH meeting.

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is C. acnes present on the incision scalpel in patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty despite extensive skin preparation techniques to prevent wound contamination. METHODS: The authors collected a consecutive case series of patients meeting inclusion criteria. Patients were included if they underwent either primary or revision shoulder arthroplasty at the tertiary-care hospital with the senior author during the study period. Culture swab samples, testing for presence of C. acnes, were collected from 17 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty with a single, fellowship-trained surgeon between November 2019 and March 2020. Culture reports were recorded as \\"positive\\" or \\"negative\\" after 21 days. Institutional Review Board approval of the study protocol was obtained. The null hypothesis was that there would be no cases with knife blades \\"culture positive\\" for C. acnes. RESULTS: 17 patients were identified and fit inclusion criteria. There were 12 males (mean age 64.3y, range 48y-79y) and 5 females (mean age 69.8y, range 59y-79y). Two patients (11.8%) were found to have C. acnes growth on the skin knife.

Therefore, the authors aim to investigate the impact of the consumer's hedonic motivations, price, access to information and trust on the online purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative, transversal study of a conclusive nature was carried out. Based on information gathered through a questionnaire administered to a sample of 750 online purchasers, a structural equation model was estimated. Findings: The results showed that the intention to continue purchasing in online shops is partly explained by access to information online, hedonic motivations and trust in e-commerce sites. It stands out that online information generates trust, and the perception of online prices does not influence loyalty but has a positive influence on hedonic motivations. Research limitations/implications: Although some constructs were ignored, for example, the integration of channels, experiential marketing and the fear of fraud, including unauthorised use of personal details, the study shows that easy access to useful information about products, prices, promotions is an important antecedent of online purchase. Practical implications: Online shop managers should pay special attention to e-commerce websites, and the information provided there should explore consumer's hedonic motivations for adventure. Furthermore, it is fundamental to create trust in order to maintain the interest in online shopping. Originality/value: The estimation of the structural model in the context of online shopping includes the influence of utilitarian motivations (price and access to information), which offer a rational experience and also include emotional motivations (hedonic adventure motivations) on the intention to buy online.

Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions), instructed to report their symptoms weekly, and when sick with cold or flu-like symptoms, requested to collect specimens (saliva and nasal swab). We compared specimen types for respiratory virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection.

In this pilot study we evaluate the use of computer\\\\based pleural line (p\\\\line) ultrasound features in comparison to traditional lung texture (TLT) features to test the hypothesis that p\\\\line thickening and irregularity are highly suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) and can be used to improve the disease diagnosis on lung ultrasound. METHODS: Twenty lung ultrasound images, including normal and COVID\\\\19 cases, were used for quantitative analysis. P\\\\lines were detected by a semiautomated segmentation method. Seven quantitative features describing thickness, margin morphology, and echo intensity were extracted. TLT lines were outlined, and texture features based on run\\\\length and gray\\\\level co\\\\occurrence matrix were extracted. The diagnostic performance of the 2 feature sets was measured and compared using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Observer agreements were evaluated by measuring interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for each feature. RESULTS: Six of 7 p\\\\line features showed a significant difference between normal and COVID\\\\19 cases. Thickness of p\\\\lines was larger in COVID\\\\19 cases (6.27  1.45 mm) compared to normal (1.00  0.19 mm), P < 0.001. Among features describing p\\\\line margin morphology, projected intensity deviation showed the largest difference between COVID\\\\19 cases (4.08  0.32) and normal (0.43  0.06), P < 0.001. From the TLT line features, only 2 features, gray\\\\level non\\\\uniformity and run\\\\length non\\\\uniformity, showed a significant difference between normal cases (0.32  0.06, 0.59  0.06) and COVID\\\\19 (0.22  0.02, 0.39  0.05), P = 0.04, respectively. All features together for p\\\\line showed perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100; whereas, TLT features had a sensitivity of 90 and specificity of 70.

Serology could help to diagnose suspected cases which lack molecular confirmation. Two case reports are presented as illustration. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of several commercial assays for COVID-19 serology. We illustrated the added value of COVID-19 serology testing in suspect COVID-19 cases with negative molecular test. Study design: Twenty-three sera from 7 patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were tested using 14 commercial assays. Additionally, 10 pre-pandemic sera and 9 potentially cross-reactive sera were selected. We calculated sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we discuss the diagnostic relevance of COVID-19 serology in a retrospective cohort of 145 COVID-19 cases in which repetitive molecular and serological SARS-CoV-2 tests were applied. Results: The interpretation of the pooled sensitivity of IgM/A and IgG resulted in the highest values (range 14-71% on day 2-7; 88-94% on day 8-18). Overall, the specificity of the assays was high (range 79-100%). Among 145 retrospective cases, 3 cases (2%) remained negative after sequential molecular testing but positive on final SARS-CoV-2 serology. Conclusion: Sensitivity of COVID-19 serological diagnosis was variable but consistently increased at >7 days after symptom onset. Specificity was high. Our data suggest that serology can complement molecular testing for diagnosis of COVID-19, especially for patients presenting the 2nd week after symptom onset or later.","output":"Sensitivity and specificity of 14 SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and their diagnostic potential in RT-PCR negative COVID-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Relative to the rest of Europe, the UK has relatively poor cancer outcomes, with late diagnosis and a slow referral process being major contributors. General practitioners (GPs) are often faced with patients presenting with a multitude of non-specific symptoms that could be cancer. Safety netting can be used to manage diagnostic uncertainty by ensuring patients with vague symptoms are appropriately monitored, which is now even more crucial due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its major impact on cancer referrals. The ThinkCancer! Workshop is an educational behaviour change intervention aimed at the whole general practice team, designed to improve primary care approaches to ensure timely diagnosis of cancer. The workshop will consist of teaching and awareness sessions, the appointment of a Safety Netting Champion and the development of a bespoke Safety Netting Plan, and has been adapted so it can be delivered remotely. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! Intervention for a future definitive randomised controlled trial. Methods The ThinkCancer! study is a randomised, multisite feasibility trial, with an embedded process evaluation and feasibility economic analysis. Twenty-three to 30 general practices will be recruited across Wales, randomised in a ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control who will follow usual care. The workshop will be delivered by a GP educator and will be adapted iteratively throughout the trial period. Baseline practice characteristics will be collected via questionnaire. We will also collect Primary Care Intervals (PCI), Two Week Wait (2WW) referral rates, conversion rates and detection rates at baseline and six months post-randomisation. Participant feedback, researcher reflections and economic costings will be collected following each workshop. A process evaluation will assess implementation using an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire and qualitative interviews. An economic feasibility analysis will inform a future economic evaluation. Discussion This study will allow us to test and further develop a novel evidenced-based complex intervention aimed at general practice teams to expedite the diagnosis of cancer in primary care. The results from this study will inform the future design of a full-scale definitive phase III trial.

Resilience is a crucial component to consider during times of prolonged stress, such as experienced during the coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, given that chronic stress has been associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Here, we investigated whether psychological resilience modified levels of perceived stress (assessed over 7 months), as well as examined the influence of demographic variables and Alzheimers disease biomarkers on this relationship. METHOD: In May\\\\November 2020 of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, 39 cognitively normal participants (mean age=78.38; 53.85% female) in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) completed questionnaires assessing stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) and resilience (only at baseline; Connor\\\\Davidson Resilience Scale), higher scores on each measure indicating greater stress and increased resilience, respectively. We used previously collected data to better characterize the cohort, with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC;mean=0.46, SD=0.79) to assess cognition, and PET imaging data to assess A? burden. A hierarchical regression model was used to assess whether resilience could predict baseline perceived stress. A separate linear mixed effect model (LME) was used to explore how resilience, time, and their interaction may affect stress. Both models also included age, sex, education, cognition, and A? status (SUVR>1.324). RESULT: Perceived stress levels were generally low (mean=13.54, SD=8.65, range=0\\\\35), and did not significantly vary over the study period (p>0.5; mean number of timepoints=3.13). Both models demonstrated a main effect of resilience, such that higher resilience was associated with lower stress levels (p<0.001;Figure 1). Perceived stress was not influenced by demographic factors, cognition or A? status. No significant interaction was found between resilience and time in predicting stress levels longitudinally. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, suggesting that resilience could be an important target for potential interventions in the future. Efforts at increasing resilience could not only help support older adults navigating stressful situations, but may also mitigate negative effects of stress on neurocognitive and mental health.","output":"Resilience and perceived stress in cognitively normal older adults during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims There was understandable anxiety from trainees about the transition to the online format of the CASC due to the pandemic. There is also significant variability between trusts in the availability of lectures tailored specifically to the CASC exam. Having recent experience of the CASC exam, including the online format, we developed a free online lecture series. We aimed to address common questions relating to the exam, and selected topics that trainees may find daunting or had less experience with through clinical care. The topics covered were: An Introduction to the CASC, Mental State Examinations, Psychological Therapies, Pharmacology and a Q&A Session. Method The course was designed to tackle areas that trainees often find difficult based on our own experiences as well as surveying course attendees. Prior to the course, we liaised with consultant site tutors & junior doctor representatives to integrate the course into the local academic programme, and to facilitate promotion of the session to trainees across sites. We subsequently offered registration to trainees nationally. The course was planned and delivered by the organisers through interactive lecture-based presentations with handouts, ahead of the January 2021 examinations. Content was based on national guidelines and published research. 5 sessions were delivered with the final session including guest consultant panellists to answer trainee questions. Quantitative and qualitative feedback was collected from the attendees. Result 172 doctors registered onto the course, with 44 NHS trusts represented. Doctors from a variety of grades attended, with 55% CT3s, 17% Specialty Doctors, 16% CT2s, 8% CT1s, 4% in other roles. 100% of attendees stated that they would recommend the course to any doctor sitting the CASC. 97% of attendees rated the course as either Excellent or Good. Qualitative feedback was positive and 3 themes were identified- communication, content and the online format. Conclusion The CASC course provided an opportunity to deliver national teaching to trainees based on national guidelines and peer-reviewed research, with a focus on addressing areas that trainees may feel less confident with. The course received significant positive feedback from attendees. The significant number of pre-CT3 trainees attending the course suggests that there may be an interest from this group for further support in developing the complex communication skills that ultimately are assessed by the CASC exam.","output":"A national CASC course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amidst the current covid-19 pandemic situation continuous health monitoring becomes important.

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor - critical for virus entry into lung cells - is found in different neurons supports this expectation. We employ a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor but not TMPRSS2 in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to the infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident 72 hours later. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Infectability of human BrainSphere neurons suggests neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The weather-related conditions change the ecosystem and pose a threat to social, economic and environmental development. It creates unprecedented or unanticipated human health problems in various places or times of the year. Africa is the world's second largest and most populous continent and has relatively changeable weather conditions. The present study aims to investigate the impact of weather conditions, heat and humidity on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic in various regions of Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, 16 highly populated countries from North, South, East, West, and Central African regions were selected. The data on COVID-19 pandemic including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The daily temperature and humidity figures were obtained from the weather web \\"Time and Date\\". The daily cases, deaths, temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of \\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\\" in the African region, from Feb 14 to August 2, 2020. RESULTS In African countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Feb 14, 2020 to August 2, 2020 was 26.160.12C, and humidity was 57.410.38%. The overall results revealed a significant inverse correlation between humidity and the number of cases (r= -0.192, p<0.001) and deaths (r= -0.213, p<0.001). Similarly, a significant inverse correlation was found between temperature and the number of cases (r= -0.25, p<0.001) and deaths (r=-0.18, p<0.001). Furthermore, the regression results showed that with 1% increase in humidity the number of cases and deaths was significantly reduced by 3.6% and 3.7% respectively. Congruently, with 1C increase in temperature, the number of cases and deaths was also significantly reduced by 15.1% and 10.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increase in relative humidity and temperature was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in various African countries.

Further, this study examines the impact of government restrictions on the performance of construction in Victoria, Australia. The data analyses in this paper identify the specific effects on industrial production, during the different lockdown stages, in three local construction companies. Companies were selected from different points along the supply chain. Company A is a supplier involved in the manufacturing of structural steel. Company B conducts logistics and procurement. Company C is a construction engineering business specializing in foundations. After reviewing relevant case studies and theories, data analyses were developed in collaboration with these companies. The results revealed that the impact of restrictions on the workers on individual construction projects was not significant. Stage 4 restrictions (Victorias highest lockdown level) significantly impacted overall income by limiting construction to only servicing essential infrastructure or essential businesses. The novel contribution of this study is the data analysis outcome for Victoria, where a high level of restrictions were experienced, such as curfew and enforced isolation at home, relative to other countries. In 2021 and 2022 (omicron variant dominated), Victoria was again at the brink of an infection wave, which showed a similar pattern to July 2020, and endured the worlds longest COVID-19 lockdown.

DESIGN: A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis of daily service-level activity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Mental healthcare data were extracted from 10 UK providers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily (weekly for one site) deaths from all causes, referrals and discharges, inpatient care (admissions, discharges, caseloads) and community services (face-to-face (f2f)/non-f2f contacts, caseloads): Adult, older adult and child/adolescent mental health; early intervention in psychosis; home treatment teams and liaison/Accident and Emergency (A&E). Data were extracted from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 May 2020 for all sites, supplemented to 31 July 2020 for four sites. Changes around the commencement and lifting of COVID-19 'lockdown' policy (23 March and 10 May, respectively) were estimated using a RDiT design with a difference-in-difference approach generating incidence rate ratios (IRRs), meta-analysed across sites. RESULTS: Pooled estimates for the lockdown transition showed increased daily deaths (IRR 2.31, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.87), reduced referrals (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) and reduced inpatient admissions (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and caseloads (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) compared with the pre lockdown period. All community services saw shifts from f2f to non-f2f contacts, but varied in caseload changes. Lift of lockdown was associated with reduced deaths (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66), increased referrals (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) and increased inpatient admissions (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42) and caseloads (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) compared with the lockdown period. Site-wide activity, inpatient care and community services did not return to pre lockdown levels after lift of lockdown, while number of deaths did.

To date, there are no approved vaccines against ZIKV infection. Various preclinical and clinical development programs are currently ongoing in an effort to bring forward a vaccine for ZIKV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We have developed a ZIKV vaccine candidate based on Virus-Like-Particles (VLPs) produced in HEK293 mammalian cells using the prM (a precursor to M protein) and envelope (E) structural protein genes from ZIKV. Transient transfection of cells via plasmid and electroporation produced VLPs which were subsequently purified by column chromatography yielding approximately 2mg/L. Initially, immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in AG129 mice using a dose titration of VLP with and without Alhydrogel 2% (alum) adjuvant. We found that VLP with and without alum elicited ZIKV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and that titers correlated with protection. A follow-up immunogenicity and efficacy study in rhesus macaques was performed using VLP formulated with alum. Multiple neutralization assay methods were performed on immune sera including a plaque reduction neutralization test, a microneutralization assay, and a Zika virus Renilla luciferase neutralization assay. All of these assays indicate that following immunization, VLP induces high titer nAbs which correlate with protection against ZIKV challenge. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies confirm that ZIKV VLPs could be efficiently generated and purified. Upon VLP immunization, in both mice and NHPs, nAb was induced that correlate with protection against ZIKV challenge.

In this study, a simple and real-time prediction of COVID-19 cases incorporating existing variables of coronavirus variants was used to explore the correlation among different European countries in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases officially recorded on a daily basis. Data from selected countries over the past 76 weeks were analysed using a Pearson correlation technique to determine if there were correlations between case trends and geographical position. The correlation coefficient (r) was employed for identifying whether the different countries in Europe were interrelated, with r > 0.85 indicating they were very strongly correlated, 0.85 > r > 0.8 indicating that they were strongly correlated, 0.8 > r > 0.7 indicating that they were moderately correlated, and r < 0.7 indicating that the examined countries were either weakly correlated or that a correlation did not exist. The results showed that although some neighbouring countries are strongly correlated, other countries that are not geographically close are also correlated. In addition, some countries on opposite sides of Europe (Belgium and Armenia) are also correlated. Other countries (France, Iceland, Israel, Kosovo, San Marino, Spain, Sweden and Turkey) were either weakly correlated or had no relationship at all.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 future trends for different European countries using Pearson correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several hotel businesses are interested in robotic deployment to improve customer service, enhance hotel productivity, and gain a competitive advantage. In this study, I deployed a robot in a real working environment to explore stakeholders perceptions and investigate factors involved in robotic deployment in Thai hotels.

As there was no robotic deployment in Thai hotels, Peanut, a navigation service robot, was temporarily assigned to work in the hotels to allow key informantshotel executives, human resource managers, reception managers, hotel staff, and hotel gueststo understand the phenomenon and experience robotic deployment. The findings revealed that stakeholders in Thai hotels accepted the robot; however, this acceptance was contingent on various robot, human, and organizational dimensions.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the spring 2020 lockdown in Germany on healthcare-seeking and health-related lifestyle in the old aged and to identify susceptible subgroups. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up survey among the pre-pandemically well-characterized participants of our AugUR cohort study, residents in/around Regensburg aged 70+ years and relatively mobile. A self-completion questionnaire on current behavior, perceived changes, and SARS-Cov-2 infection was mailed in May 2020, shortly before contact restrictions ended. Pre-pandemic lifestyle and medical conditions were derived from previous study center visits. RESULTS: Among 1850 survey participants (73C98 years; net-response 89%), 74% were at increased risk for severe COVID-19 according to medical conditions; four participants reported SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.2%). Participants reported changes in behavior: 29% refrained from medical appointments, 14% increased TV consumption, 26% reported less physical activity, but no systematic increase of smoking or alcohol consumption. When comparing during- and pre-lockdown reports of lifestyle within participant, we found the same pattern as for the reported perceived changes. Women and the more educated were more susceptible to changes. Worse QOL was perceived by 38%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the spring 2020 lockdown did not affect the lifestyle of a majority of the mobile old aged individuals, but the substantial proportions with decreased physical activity and healthcare-seeking are markers of collateral damage.

Much effort is given to stopping the trade of charismatic megafauna such as tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses. Endangered plant species, however, receive far less attention and fewer resources, resulting in devastating consequences. Plant species continue to go extinct due to illegal harvesting and selling, while just one order of plants, Orchidales, makes up more than 70% of all threatened wildlife species. This study examines the role the Internet plays in critically endangered plant transactions. Rather than focusing on the dark web for these sales, I search the e-commerce site eBay to better understand the extent to which these trades take place in plain sight. Of the 193 critically endangered plant species examined, 56 were for sale in some form on eBay during the study period. These results indicate a high degree of trading in these species, but do not necessarily indicate criminality. The complexity of the international legal frameworks regulating these transactions makes it difficult to ascertain their legality, but certain indicators point to at least a subset of these sales being unlawful. E-commerce sites like eBay must take more proactive measures to regulate sales and protect these species on the brink, for it is clear the surface web is playing an understudied and important role in fostering these cybercrimes. In sum, the dark web is unnecessary when the surface web is convenient, widely available, and scarcely policed.","output":"Who Needs the Dark Web?

Traditional grading (e.g., A, B, C, D, F) is common in secondary schools;however, proficiency-based grading (also referred to as standards-based grading, mastery learning, or competency-based education) is another system that schools have adopted to assess student learning. This mixed-method inquiry analyzed survey data from 72 college sophomores and interview data from four university admissions counselors. Data revealed that 1) students believe that traditional grading methods inadequately measure learning, yet they still prefer letter grades over the proficiency-based model, and 2) counselors evaluate a wide array of grading systems for college admission based on procedures that are not universal. Given that many post-secondary institutions have removed the standardized testing requirement of the SAT/ACT in the admissions process during the COVID-19 climate, universities must now carefully consider how to evaluate applications given the varied grading systems represented.

This exploratory study sought to identify the pandemics psychological impact on the Israeli public using a mixed-methods approach. Methods During the COVID-19 outbreak, Israeli adults (N = 1,407) completed a battery of measures assessing psychological variables and perceived threat related to COVID-19. Statistical analyses included tests for between-group differences and Pearson correlations. Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews (N = 38) were conducted. Results The findings of the quantitative study indicate that about half of the public were concerned, afraid and stressed and a fifth perceived they were liable to contract the virus. Moreover, a positive correlation emerged between these feelings and degree of perceived threat. Three major themes emerged from the qualitative study: 1) a sense of shock and chaos;2) gradual adjustment to the new reality;3) fears and concerns for self and family members. Conclusions The study provides a comprehensive picture of psychological variables and perceived threat related to COVID-19 in Israel.

To identify risk factors for measles death, we conducted a case-control study among infants and children hospitalized for measles. METHODS: National surveillance data were used to identify hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked measles in infants and children aged < 59 months with rash onset from January 2016 to July 2018. We abstracted medical records of 50 fatal cases (cases) and 250 non-fatal cases (controls) matched by age, sex, district of residence, and urban/rural place of residence. We calculated univariable and multivariable matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of case-patients and controls had not received a valid dose of a measles-containing vaccine; only 5 % received Vitamin A supplementation once diagnosed with measles. In the univariable analysis, cases were more likely than controls to have had a healthcare-related exposure to measles manifesting as inpatient admission for pneumonia during the 7 to 21 day measles incubation period (OR: 3.0; 95% CI [1.2, 7.2]), to have had a history of malnutrition (OR: 3.4; 95% CI [1.1, 9.9]), and to have had pneumonia as a complication of measles (OR:7.1; 95% CI [2.0C24.8]). In the multivariable analysis, pneumonia as a measles complication remained a risk for death (OR: 7.1; 95% CI [1.4C35.3]). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing infection prevention and control practices, ensuring immunization of healthcare workers, and hospitalizing only severe measles cases may minimize the risk of nosocomial measles transmission.

Although the lecturer-course assignmentproblem has been studied widely as part of the education timetabling problem, no existing lecturer-courseassignment model suits this circumstance. The new cases in this program are as follows. First, this program isconducted online. Second, the participants are students and lecturers from different universities. Based on thisproblem, this work proposes a novel lecturer-course assignment model that suits this program. The lecturers'preferred courses and timeslots become hard constraints. The model has three objectives: (1) maximizing theeducational quality, (2) maximizing the lecturers' time preference, and (3) minimizing the number of unservedclasses. This model is developed by using integer linear programming and optimized by using cloud theory-basedsimulated annealing. This proposed model is then compared with the four previous lecturers-course assignmentmodels. The first model concerns about minimizing the number of unserved classes, while the second model focuseson maximizing the education quality. The maximum number of classes per course for every lecturer is considered inthe third model while balancing the lecturers load (teach, research, community service) is the feature of the fourthmodel. The research concludes that the proposed model is appropriate for lecture-course assignment in Indonesiasnational joint courses program compared to the previous models.

Cyano-acrylic glue Glubran?2 glue is commercially available and is generally used as embolizing agent and for the prevention of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. CASE DESCRIPTION A 25-year-old woman underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. After tumor resection, sellar floor reconstruction was performed by mucosal graft and Glubran?2 glue. The early post-operative period was uneventful. However, 2 months after surgery, the patient complained of headache, facial pain and greenish foul-smelling nasal discharge with solid particles dripping from the nose. Medical treatment was unsuccessful. Brain MRI showed inflammation and thickening of the sphenoidal and para-sphenoidal mucosa. The patient underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery and a solid glass-like mass surrounded by inflamed infected mucosa was seen in the inferior and lateral aspects of the sphenoid sinus. Efforts were made to erupt and de-crust the solid mass until total resection was achieved. Early post-operative period was uneventful, and a course of antibiotics was continued until total disappearance of the discharge.

This region is also known by its geological diversity and, consequently, lithology, which are intimately related to the orography. The combination of all these factors allowed the proliferation of this traditional drystone walls during the last centuries, and they represent not only an important element of the landscape, but also a perspective of the social, economic and technical bases of Algarves heritage. This article intends to present this diversity and the relationship between its various facets. In order to achieve the objectives, several field surveys were carried out to different geological zones, with the intention of gathering information related to the natural material used and its construction technique, as well as interaction with local inhabitants. These visits were supported by bibliographic and Web-graphic research, to substantiate the hypotheses. Based on the data results it is possible to identify a close interconnection between the geology and wall structure typology, since they are made with the natural rock fragments (raw material) found nearby. However, its function is more related to the orogeny and lithology, the latter defining also the type of agricultural culture. The study is enriched by the enormous diversity of rock types, although the Algarve is a relatively small region. The main limitations found during the development of the study are related to the physical access to the walls and the interviews with the locals. These constrictions were due to the lack of land maintenance, allowing vegetation to growth naturally, invading and covering the walls, and also due to the pandemic situation brought by the COVID-19 virus, which interdict the interaction between persons and also the travels. Despite the restrictions mentioned, the fieldtrips gave enough data to support the correlation between the geology, lithology and the raw material used on the drystone walls, as well as their relation to the terraces that proliferate in specific areas of Algarve. In view of the scarcity of bibliographic elements associated with this subject, in the studied territory, the elaboration of documents that allow the identification, characterization, geo-location and dissemination of the object of study, is considered as an asset for this theme. Finally, the study aims to alert and counter the tendency to abandon this type of heritage, valuing it and making it known.","output":"Drystone walls in the Algarve, Portugal.

Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3(+) T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.

We gathered a collection of fatwas and other official and semi-official documents issued by these Islamic legal institutions, reviewed some of them, and applied manual content analysis to the other part of the sources. We also intended to find out which topics worried Muslim scholars most of all and in which way C religious or secular C they most often covered their positions on everything related to the coronavirus. In the course of the study, linguistic analysis of the sources was also carried out. It was interesting to see how often specific legal vocabulary was encountered in the analyzed sources C a sure sign that the text transmitted with its use has legal authority in the Muslim world. The study revealed a barely perceptible but intriguing difference between these Islamic institutions positions towards the Corona Crisis. ? 2021 Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad.

METHODS: Mixed methods were used and they included a bibliometric analysis, a standardised survey and indepth interviews with top officials of 11 selected global health research and educational institutions in mainland China. RESULTS: The bibliometric analysis revealed that each institution had its own focus areas, some with a balanced focus among chronic illness, infectious disease and health systems, while others only focused on one of these areas. Interviews of key staff from each institution showed common themes: recognition that the current research capacity in global health is relatively weak, optimism towards the future, as well as an emphasis on mutual beneficial networking with other countries. Specific obstacles raised and the solutions applied by each institution were listed and discussed. CONCLUSION: Global health institutions in China are going through a transition from learning and following established protocols to taking a more leading role in setting up Chinas own footprint in this area. Gaps still remain, both in comparison with international institutions, as well as between the leading Chinese institutions and those that have just started. More investment needs to be made, from both public and private domains, to improve the overall capacity as well as the mutual learning and communication within the academic community in China.","output":"Research capacity of global health institutions in China: a gap analysis focusing on their collaboration with other low-income and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

We observe natural phonatory and swallowing functions in clinical examinations with a trans-nasal laryngeal fiberscope (TNLF). Before each observation, we use epinephrine to enlarge and smooth the common nasal meatus (bottom of nostril) and then insert a wet swab inside the nose, as in taking a swab culture in the nasopharynx. During the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this careful technique prevents any complications, including nasal bleeding, painfulness, and induced sneezing. Here, we introduce our routine to observe esophageal movement in swallowing in a natural (sitting) position without anesthesia. CASE PRESENTATION: The case was a 70-year-old female who complained that something was stuck in her esophagus; there was a strange sensation below the larynx and pharynx. After enlarging and smoothing the common nasal meatus, we inserted the TNLF (slim type a2.9 mm fiberscope, VNL8-J10, PENTAX Medical, Tokyo, Japan.) in the normal way. We then observed the phonatory and swallowing movements of the vocal folds. As usual, to not interfere with natural movements, we used no anesthesia. We found no pathological condition in the pyriform sinus. We asked the patient to swallow the fiberscope. During the swallow, we pushed the TNLF and inserted the tip a bit deeper, which made the fiberscope easily enter the esophagus, like in the insertion of a nasogastric tube. We then asked the patient to swallow a sip of water or saliva to clear and enlarge the lumen of the esophagus. This made it possible to observe the esophagus easily without any air supply. With tone enhancement scan, the esophagus was found to be completely normal except for glycogenic acanthosis. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of this examination is that it is easily able to perform without anesthesia and with the patient in sitting position. It is quick and minimally invasive, enabling observation the physiologically natural swallowing. It is also possible to observe without anesthesia down to the level of the esophagogastric junction using with a thin type flexible bronchoscope. In the future, gastric fiberscopes might be thinner, even with narrow band imaging (NBI) function. Before that time, physicians should remember to just insert along the bottom of the nose.","output":"Natural nasal-esophageal fiberscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic-preventing sneezing without anesthesia: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this manuscript we provide the scientific basis to adopt a novel combination of two widely available nutraceuticals; resveratrol and zinc in management of COVID-19 recommending their administration using a nano-carrier based drug-delivery system.

Compared to methods requiring sophisticated camera setups, the image-based rendering method based on photogrammetry can work with images captured with any poses, which is more suitable for casual users. However, existing image-based-rendering methods are based on perspective images. When used to reconstruct 6-DoF views, it often requires capturing hundreds of images, making data capture a tedious and time-consuming process. In contrast to traditional perspective images, 360 images capture the entire surrounding view in a single shot, thus, providing a faster capturing process for 6-DoF view reconstruction. This paper presents a novel method to provide 6-DoF experiences over a wide area using an unstructured collection of 360 panoramas captured by a conventional 360 camera. Our method consists of 360 data capturing, novel depth estimation to produce a high-quality spherical depth panorama, and high-fidelity free-viewpoint generation.

We identified group and individual level determinants for attitudes, operating directly and indirectly, that influence vaccine uptake. We found that access issues, often ignored within the public anti-vaxdebate, remain highly pertinent. Finally, a consistent theme was the effect of misinformation and lack of knowledge or trust in healthcare, often stemming from the Wakefield controversy.

Activity levels are generally below recommended levels and reduce with age. There is concern that exercise levels may be further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital approaches may offer a means for older people to engage in strength and balance exercises independently in their own homes. The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate existing apps and websites to support independent engagement in strength and balance exercises by older people. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of apps and websites, following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for available apps in the Android and iOS app stores, and performed a database search (MEDLINE and EMBASE) for apps in development. We searched for websites using the Google search engine. Apps and websites were evaluated in terms of existing evidence for effectiveness, use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs), and quality. Results: We evaluated 13 apps and 24 websites on the basis of our selection criteria. Considering the evidence-base, quality and BCT scores, four apps and six websites are recommended for use by older people who wish to engage in exercise independently in their own homes. No apps or websites have been to RCT evaluation at the time of review.

As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) C a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-ACtriggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model.

Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services. Key Points: Telehealth for prenatal care is feasible. Telehealth may reduce coronavirus exposure during prenatal care. Telehealth should be tailored for high risk prenatal patients.","output":"Telehealth for High-Risk Pregnancies in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in the United States, Sweden and Norway.

EQ-5D-5L was used to assess health status of respondents. Results were compared between the two waves to measure changes in HRQoL. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between countries, and t-tests for differences between waves. Results: We collected 2,734, 1,003 and 1,020 responses in Wave 1, and 2,252, 1,013 and 1,011 responses in Wave 2 for the US, Sweden, and Norway respectively. Corresponding mean (SD) EQ-VAS scores were 74.6 (19.2), 68.7 (21.4), and 69.2 (20.8) in Wave 1 (p<0.001), and 76.4 (18.6), 68.2 (20.3), and 67.8 (21.7) in Wave 2 (p<0.001). Between waves, only the VAS scores in the US were significantly different (p<0.001). Mean (SD) utility scores were 0.822 (0.222), 0.768 (0.260), and 0.808 (0.248) in wave 1 (p<0.001), and 0.823 (0.221), 0.783 (0.237), and 0.777 (0.271) in wave 2 (p<0.001);there were no significant differences between waves for all three countries.

The proportions reporting problems in anxiety/depression increased in wave 2 for Sweden and Norway, but decreased for the US. Conclusions: Population HRQoL in Sweden and Norway has been similar throughout the pandemic, while a rebound in population mean VAS was observed in the US. However, the large proportions reporting problems in anxiety/depression across waves in all 3 countries indicates that mental health issues resulting from the pandemic are a major concern.","output":"P63 Impact of COVID-19 on Health-Related Quality-of-Life in the United States, Sweden and Norway: A Cross-Country Comparison Using a Panel Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: La alta transmisibilidad y expansin del nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) en el mundo constituyen un alto riesgo laboral para los profesionales de la salud, especialmente las enfermeras.

Assessments have been conducted into the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and into diseases such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, ADHD or ulcerative colitis. METHODS Analyses of nicotine administration protocols and safety were conducted after reviewing Medline and Science Direct databases performing a search using the words [transdermal nicotine] AND [non-smoker] AND selected diseases. RESULTS Among 298 articles identified, there were 35 reviewed publications reporting on 33 studies of non-smokers receiving transdermal nicotine for >48hours. In the 16 randomized trials, 7 crossover, 1 case/control and 9 open studies patients received an initial nicotine dose of between 2.5mg and 15mg/day. In 22 studies, daily doses increased by 2 to 7 steps in 3 to 96 days until the dose was between 5mg and 105mg/day. The target nicotine dose was 19.0620.89mg/day.

METHODS: A mobile acoustic UFM application represents a noninvasive method to estimate the urine flow rate by recording voiding sounds with a smartphone. Male pediatric patients who were undergoing UFM testing were prospectively recruited, and the voiding sounds were recorded and analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare the maximum flow rate (Qmax), average flow rate (Qavg), voiding time (VT), and voiding volume (VV) as estimated by acoustic UFM with those calculated by standard UFM. Differences in Qmax, Qavg, VT, and VV between the 2 UFM tests were determined using 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement. RESULTS: A total of 16 male patients were evaluated. Their median age was 9 years. With standard UFM, the median Qmax, Qavg, VT, and VV were 18.7 mL/sec, 11.1 mL/sec, 15.2 seconds, and 157.8 mL, respectively. Strong correlations were observed between the 2 methods for Qmax (ICC=0.755, P=0.005), VT (ICC=0.974, P<0.001), and VV (ICC=0.930, P<0.001), but not for Qavg (ICC=0.442, P=0.135). The Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the 2 UFM tests. Flow patterns recorded by acoustic UFM and conventional UFM showed good visual correlations.

However, data from real-world and recent meta-analyses have suggested that the anti-ischemic benefits of ticagrelor could be lower than expected, potentially outweighed by an increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ticagrelor as compared to the conventional antiplatelet agents (ASA and clopidogrel) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), enclosing patients with acute coronary syndromes and stable CAD. METHODS: Literature and main scientific session abstracts were searched for studies comparing a ticagrelor-based antiplatelet regimen vs different antiplatelet agents in patients with CAD. The primary efficacy endpoint was mortality, and the primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleedings. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS: We included 15 randomized clinical trials, with a total population of 73,402 patients (55% randomized to ticagrelor). At a mean follow-up of 15a?a?11.3a?months, the ticagrelor based strategy did not significantly reduce mortality as compared to traditional therapy (OR[95%CI]a?=a?0.88[0.70,1.09], pa?=a?0.24; phet<0.00001), with comparable results and no interaction according to patients' presentation (p interactiona?=a?0.80). A similar result was achieved for cardiovascular mortality, whereas the reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction was significant (OR[95%CI]a?=a?0.84[0.78,0.90], pa?<a?0.00001; pheta?=a?0.76). As for the risk of stroke, the largest reduction was observed in stable patients, while a neutral effect was observed in the ACS subgroup (p inta?=a?0.35). Major bleeding events were increased in ticagrelor-treated patients (OR [95%CI]a?=a?1.40 [1.06, 1.84], pa?=a?0.02; phet<0.00001), especially ICH (OR [95% CI]a?=a?1.45[1.13,1.84], pa?=a?0.003; pheta?=a?0.93), and mainly among non-ACS patient. No interaction for any outcome endpoint was observed according to patients' age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current meta-analysis, a ticagrelor-based strategy for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is associated to a significant increase in major bleeding complications and especially for intracranial hemorrhage, as compared to a strategy based on conventional antiplatelet agents, while resulting in a neutral effect on survival.

On a national level, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has modified operation guidelines for the evaluation and early release of eligible non-violent, at-risk offenders. However, each state government and Department of Corrections have the responsibility and jurisdiction to enforce policies within their own prison systems. To combat the escalation of positive cases and to protect the safety of inmates, some prison systems have accelerated early release procedures for eligible prisoners. Compared to other states, the State of Nevada has started early with the enforcement of quarantine and testing protocols to combat the spread of COVID-19, starting in early March. However, the State of Nevada has not passed orders for the early release or home confinement of eligible inmates. States such as California and Pennsylvania, have already created criteria for inmates eligible for early release and have released prisoners. Other states like Arizona and Indiana have not released guidelines but are looking favorably toward doing so. Growing incarceration rates are rapidly overwhelming facility operational capacities, which only makes the probability of spreading COVID-19 within prisons and outside the prisons inevitable. Data analysis shows an increased probability of having positive cases and community spread of COVID-19 within a correctional facility as prison size, which was indicated by the population capacity, increases. In all states, the number of confirmed cases continues to steadily climb. Before more outbreaks can potentially occur and more prisoners' lives are lost, it is crucial to look at measures to decrease inmate population capacities such as decreasing the intake of new prisoners, expanding space in existing facilities to enforce social distancing, and maximizing storage spaces. Home-confinement is another possible option that prisons can utilize to help decrease prison populations. This study examines the relationship between increasing prison populations and the escalating number of total confirmed positive cases of COVID-19, while proposing for the state Department of Corrections to implement a reduction in prison populations to decrease the transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Decreasing Inmate Populations to Mitigate Effects of COVID-19 in State Prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to clarify the impact of hypertension on COVID-19 and investigate whether the prior use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors affects the prognosis of COVID-19. A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension. Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups. Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8+ cells on admission. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20-2.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36-3.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4+ cells. The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group. In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19.

However, their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries, where such cases are most often encountered. This is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations; DNA vaccines being most promising amongst them. Here, we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity. These strategies include use of signal sequences namely Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA), Ubiquitin (UQ) and Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1). TPA, LAMP-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the CD4(+) T cell and antibody response. In contrast, the UQ tag was utilized for enhancing CD8(+) response. The potency of modified DNA vaccines assessed by total antibody response, antibody isotypes, cytokine profile, neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge; was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine, but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity. Interestingly, the DNA vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response. In conclusion, our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies.","output":"Rabies DNA vaccine: No impact of MHC Class I and Class II targeting sequences on immune response and protection against lethal challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human mobility was associated with epidemic changes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, where strict public health interventions reduced human mobility and COVID-19 epidemics.

We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rates evolve dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. Social distancing measures are triggered by the number of infections, providing a dynamic feedback-loop which slows the spread of the virus. We estimate the total cost of several distinct containment policies incurring over the entire path of the endemic. Costs comprise direct medical cost for intensive care, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, the total costs are highest at a medium level of reactivity when value of life costs are omitted. Very strict measures fare best, with a hands-off policy coming second. Our key findings are independent of the specific parameter estimates, which are to be adjusted with the COVID-19 research status.

In South Africa (SA), intensive care is faced with the challenge of resource scarcity as well as an increasing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) services. ICU services are expensive, and practitioners in low- to middle-income countries experience daily the consequences of limited resources. Critically limited resources necessitate that rationing and triage (prioritisation) decisions are frequently necessary in SA, particularly in the publicly funded health sector. Purpose. The purpose of this consensus statement is to examine key questions that arise when considering the status of ICU resources in SA, and more specifically ICU admission, rationing and triage decisions. The accompanying guideline in this issue is intended to guide frontline triage policy and ensure the best utilisation of intensive care in SA, while maintaining a fair distribution of available resources. Fair and efficient triage is important to ensure the ongoing provision of high-quality care to adult patients referred for intensive care. Recommendations. In response to 14 key questions developed using a modified Delphi technique, 29 recommendations were formulated and graded using an adapted GRADE score. The 14 key questions addressed the status of the provision of ICU services in SA, the degree of resource restriction, the efficiency of resource management, the need for triage, and how triage could be most justly implemented. Important recommendations included the need to formally recognise and accurately quantify the provision of ICU services in SA by national audit; actively seek additional resources from governmental bodies; consider methods to maximise the efficiency of ICU care; evaluate lower level of care alternatives; develop a triage guideline to assist policy-makers and frontline practitioners to implement triage decisions in an efficient and fair way; measure and audit the consequence of triage; and promote research to improve the accuracy and consistency of triage decisions. The consensus document and guideline should be reviewed and revised appropriately within 5 years. Conclusion. In recognition of the absolute need to limit patient access to ICU because of the lack of sufficient intensive care resources in public hospitals, recommendations and a guideline have been developed to guide policy-making and assist frontline triage decision-making in SA. These documents are not a complete plan for quality practice but rather the beginning of a long-term initiative to engage clinicians, the public and administrators in appropriate.","output":"The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa Consensus Statement on ICU Triage and Rationing (ConICTri)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To establish if day case superficial parotidectomy is feasible, safe and does not result in excess readmissions. METHOD: A retrospective review was carried out of all patients listed for superficial parotidectomy with day case intent by a single surgeon between January 2016 and December 2019 inclusively. The reasons for failure of same day discharge were established. Postoperative complications and readmissions were recorded. Our approach for a superficial parotidectomy typically includes the use of a 10Fr suction drain which is removed at 4 h postoperatively if the output is less than 30 ml. RESULTS: Ninety-one consecutive superficial parotidectomies listed for day case surgery were eligible for inclusion. Seventeen patients failed to be discharged on the same day and were admitted giving a day case success rate of 81%. Most of these (n = 9) occurred in the first year of adopting day case surgery. The most common reason to admit patients was a late finish (n = 8, 47%). Six patients (25%) were admitted due to anaesthetic complications. One patient had a surgical complication requiring admission. CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrates that day case superficial parotidectomy using a surgical drain is feasible, safe and does not result in an unacceptable readmission rate. In our experience, surgical complications are an uncommon cause for day case failure. The most common cause for day case failure was a late finish.

Moreover, details of the transmission cycle of the virus remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of camels as a reservoir host for human infections. METHODS: We present a first analysis of the environmental circumstances under which MERS-CoV cases have occurred in the Middle East, covering all case occurrences through May 2015, using ecological niche modeling approaches to map transmission risk. We compare the environmental breadth of conditions under which cases have reported camel contacts with that of the broader population of all cases, to assess whether camel-associated cases occur under a more restricted set of environmental circumstances. RESULTS: We documented geographic and environmental distributions of MERS-CoV cases across the Middle East, and offer preliminary mapping of transmission risk. We confirm the idea that climatic dimensions of camel-associated cases are more constrained and less variable than the broader suite of case occurrences; hence, camel exposure may be a key limiting element in MERS-CoV transmission. CONCLUSION: This study offers a first detailed geographic and environmental analysis of MERS-CoV distributions across the Middle East. Results indicated that camel-exposed cases occur under a narrower suite of environmental conditions than non-camel-exposed cases, suggesting perhaps a key role for camels in the transmission of the disease, and perhaps a narrower area of risk for primary, camel-derived cases of MERS.","output":"MERS-CoV geography and ecology in the Middle East: analyses of reported camel exposures and a preliminary risk map"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Calophyllum spp. (Calophyllaceae) is a genus of tropical trees valued in the chemopharmacological industry as an important source of biogenetically related coumarins and xanthones, which can lead to the development of new drugs due to their relevant pharmacological activities and diversity of molecular structural. These compounds have relevant pharmacological activities, such as: cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines (especially leukemia), parasites (Plasmodium, Leshmania, and Trypanosoma), retroviruses (e.g., HIV), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chemoinformatic and toxicoinformatic tools were used here to perform a computational analysis of 70 coumarins and 70 xanthones isolated from this genus in order to explore their potential as new drugs. Most coumarins from this genus possess similar patterns of druglikeness with differences in its physicochemical properties. Xanthones, on the other hand, show quite similar physicochemical properties and druglikeness. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of these compounds (57 coumarins and 59 xanthones) are in compliance with Lipinskis Rule of Five. Remarkably, two xanthones (2-hydroxyxanthone and caledonixanthone-B) have leadlikeness potential that accordingly with chemoinformatic analysis may target MAO A and B, respectively, and therefore may exhibit antidepressant potential. These compounds also target tyrosine-phosphorilation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) which is over-expressed in a variety of hematological and brain cancers, therefore they could act as anticancer compounds.

Glucose fluctuations commonly occur in T2D patients with poor glycemic control or following intensive therapy. Reducing blood glucose as well as glucose fluctuations is critical to the control of T2D and its macro-/microvascular complications. The interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 located downstream of the nutrient sensor toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, is emerging as a key metabolic regulator. It remains unclear how glucose fluctuations may alter the IRF5/TLR4 expression and inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophages. To investigate this, first, we determined IRF5 gene expression by real-time qRT-PCR in the white adipose tissue samples from 39 T2D and 48 nondiabetic individuals. Next, we cultured THP-1 macrophages in hypo- and hyperglycemic conditions and compared, at the protein and transcription levels, the expressions of IRF5, TLR4, and M1/M2 polarization profile and inflammatory markers against control (normoglycemia). Protein expression was assessed using flow cytometry, ELISA, Western blotting, and/or confocal microscopy. IRF5 silencing was achieved by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. The data show that adipose IRF5 gene expression was higher in T2D than nondiabetic counterparts (p = 0.006), which correlated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r = 0.47/p < 0.001), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.23/p = 0.03), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (r = 0.56/p < 0.0001), interleukin (IL)-1 (r = 0.40/p = 0.0009), and C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 (r = 0.49/p < 0.001) expression. IRF5 expression in macrophages was induced/upregulated (p < 0.05) by hypoglycemia (3 mM/L), persistent hyperglycemia (15 mM/LC25 mM/L), and RIH/glucose fluctuations (3C15 mM/L) as compared to normoglycemia (5 mM/L). RIH/glucose fluctuations also induced M1 polarization and an inflammatory profile (CD11c, IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) in macrophages. RIH/glucose fluctuations also drove the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (p < 0.001), which is a known marker for cardiovascular complication in T2D patients. Notably, all these changes were counteracted by IRF5 silencing in macrophages. In conclusion, RIH/glucose fluctuations promote the M1 polarization and inflammatory responses in macrophages via the mechanism involving TLR4-IRF5 pathway, which may have significance for metabolic inflammation.","output":"Repetitive Intermittent Hyperglycemia Drives the M1 Polarization and Inflammatory Responses in THP-1 Macrophages Through the Mechanism Involving the TLR4-IRF5 Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work or be admitted to current off-limits locations.

We hypothesized that carotid artery stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and aortic AIx would be elevated in young adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. We evaluated 15 young adults (six male and nine female; 20  1 years of age; body mass index, 24  3 kg m-2 ) 3-4 weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result compared with young healthy adults (five male and 10 female; 23  1 years of age; body mass index, 22  2 kg m-2 ) who were evaluated before the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and cIMT were assessed using ultrasound, whereas aortic AIx and aortic AIx standardized to 75 beats min-1 (AIx@HR75) were assessed from carotid pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor. Group differences were observed for carotid stiffness (control, 5  1 m s-1 ; SARS-CoV-2, 6  1 m s-1 ), Young's modulus (control, 396  120 kPa; SARS-CoV-2, 576  224 kPa), aortic AIx (control, 3  13%; SARS-CoV-2, 13  9%) and aortic AIx@HR75 (control, -3  16%; SARS-CoV-2, 10  7%; P < 0.05). However, cIMT was similar between groups (control, 0.42  0.06 mm; SARS-CoV-2, 0.44  0.08 mm; P > 0.05). This cross-sectional analysis revealed higher carotid artery stiffness and aortic stiffness among young adults with SARS-CoV-2. These results provide further evidence of cardiovascular impairments among young adults recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be considered for cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Carotid stiffness, intima-media thickness and aortic augmentation index among adults with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scaling up effective interventions, policies and programmes can improve breastfeeding (BF) outcomes.

The purpose of this four\\\\country case studies analysis was to examine why and how improvements in BF practices occurred across four contrasting countries; Burkina Faso, the Philippines, Mexico and the United States of America. Literature reviews and key informant interviews were conducted to document BF trends over time, in addition to why and how BF protection, promotion and support policies and programmes were implemented at a national level. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted. The Breastfeeding Gear Model and RE\\\\AIM (Reach; Effectiveness; Adoption; Implementation; and Maintenance) frameworks were used to understand and map the factors facilitating or hindering the scale up of the national programmes and corresponding improvements in BF practices. Each of the studied countries had different processes and timing to implement and scale up programmes to promote, protect and support breastfeeding.

Current FDA approved inhibitors (Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib, Encorafenib) although improved progression-free survival of mtBRAF melanoma patients suffer from this treatment related side effect. mtBRAF Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is resistant to the approved BRAF inhibitors, although combinatorial treatment co-targeting BRAF and EGFR/MEK is offering a promising prospect. In an effort to explore the potential of the novel BRAF inhibitors-PB to impede CRC cell proliferation, they were tested on RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 cells, bearing the BRAFV600E mutation. This study shows that the BRAF paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 cause a more prolonged MAPK pathway inhibition and achieve a stronger blockage of proliferation and reduced viability than PLX4720, the sister compound of Vemurafenib. In some treatment conditions, cells can undergo apoptosis. Genomic analysis on the more resistant RKO cells treated with PLX7904, PLX8394 and PLX4720 showed similar gene expression pattern, but the alterations imposed by the PB were more intense. Bioinformatic analysis resulted in a short list of genes representing potential master regulators of the cellular response to BRAF inhibitors' treatments. From our results, it is clear that the BRAF paradox breakers present a notable differential regulation of major pathways, like MAPK signalling, apoptosis, cell cycle, or developmental signalling pathways. Combinatorial treatments of BRAFi with Mcl-1 and Notch modulators show a better effect than mono-treatments. Additional pathways could be further exploited in novel efficient combinatorial treatment protocols with BRAFi.","output":"BRAF paradox breakers PLX8394, PLX7904 are more effective against BRAFV600 CRC cells compared with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 and shown by detailed pathway analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Macular diseases often lead to metamorphopsia, which is traditionally tested using the Amsler grid. This study evaluates a novel method for assessing metamorphopsia, based on the software AMD-A Metamorphopsia Detector, application MacuFix?.

However, little is known on molecular mechanisms of that relationship. Bearing in mind the ubiquitous participation of peptides in biomolecular interactions and regulatory processes we attempted direct search of blood peptides originated from microbial proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out of blood serum and plasma samples taken from 20 healthy donors on Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass-spectrometer. Sample preparation was carried out based on our previously developed method of peptide desorption from the surface of major blood plasma proteins followed by standard chromatographic steps. Mascot and X! Tandem search engines were used for peptide identification. Human protein sequences were taken from UniProt Knowledgebase and sequences of human microbiota proteins-from NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP). As a result, out of 13625 identified peptides 912 were unique fragments of microbial precursors, which is 6.69% of the total amount of detected bloodstream peptides. In 30 cases peptide identification was confirmed by mass-spectral study of individual synthetic samples. Absolute quantification by the mass-spectrometric method of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) confirmed the presence of bacterial peptides in plasma and serum in the range of approximately 0.1 nMol/L to 1 mkMol/L, which is comparable to physiologically significant hormone concentrations in human blood in normal conditions. Analysis of the in silico obtained hydrolyzates of microbiotic proteins showed that significant number of the identified peptides are derived from the precursor proteins as a result of hydrolysis with trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin, the main proteases of the gastrointestinal system. 60% of the identified microbial peptides are derived from the intestine flora, about 20% - from oral microbiota and 20% fall on the remaining microbiotic communities. Most of the precursor proteins refer to intracellular, cytoplasmic proteins. The isolated fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed increase secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, colony stimulating factors and chemoattractants as the response to the addition of some of the identified microbiotic peptides.

We evaluated the ability of proADM to predict disease severity across a range of clinical outcomes in children with suspected CAP. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of children 3 months to 18 years with CAP in the emergency department. Disease severity was defined as mild (discharged home), mild-moderate (hospitalized but not moderate-severe or severe), moderate-severe (eg, hospitalized with supplemental oxygen, broadening of antibiotics, complicated pneumonia), and severe (eg, vasoactive infusions, chest drainage, severe sepsis). Outcomes were examined using proportional odds logistic regression within the cohort with suspected CAP and in a subset with radiographic CAP. RESULTS: Among 369 children, median proADM increased with disease severity (mild: median [IQR], 0.53 [0.43-0.73]; mild-moderate: 0.56 [0.45-0.71]; moderate-severe: 0.61 [0.47-0.77]; severe: 0.70 [0.55-1.04] nmol/L) (Pa? =a? .002). ProADM was significantly associated with increased odds of developing severe outcomes (suspected CAP: OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.2-2.36; radiographic CAP: OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.36-3.38) adjusted for age, fever duration, antibiotic use, and pathogen. ProADM had an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI, .56-.72) in those with suspected CAP and an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, .68-.87) in radiographic CAP.

Measurement parameters during intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) are unclear. We aimed to identify objective ICG-FA parameters associated with AL. STUDY DESIGN Patients > 18 years with an indication for ILE were enrolled. ICG-FA was performed at the abdominal and thoracic stage, and data, such as time of fluorescence appearance, speed of ICG perfusion, quality of GC perfusion (good, poor, ischemic), blood pressure, baseline patient characteristics, GC dimensions, and other intraoperative parameters were collected. On postoperative day 4 to 6, Gastrografin swallow radiography was performed. AL development was classified based on the Clavien-Dindo and SISG severity classifications. Univariate analysis with a 95% confidence level (p < 0.05) was performed. Factors with p < 0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. RESULTS 100 patients were enrolled. During ICG-FA, evaluation of subjective perfusion was a very specific test (94.1%) with good negative predictive value (NPV 71.9%, p 0.034), but not powerful enough to detect patients at risk of leak (sensibility 21.8%, PPV 63.6%). The GC perfusion speed (cm/s) after gastric vascular isolation and before tubulization showed a significant association with AL (p < 0.003). Median arterial blood pressure in the thoracic stage (p < 0.001) or use of inotropic (p < 0.033) was associated with AL development.

We used a repeated cross-sectional approach including observational data collected from one sample (N = 3748) shortly before the rollout of GameSense in 2017C2018, and from two samples collected 1 year (N = 4795) and 2 years (N = 3927) after the programs implementation. We found that awareness of the GameSense program increased between pre- and 1-year post-implementation, yet did not increase further at 2-years post-implementation. Bivariate analyses showed that respondents who were aware of more GameSense components had a better understanding of gambling concepts and used more RG strategies, whereas respondents who engaged with GameSense used more RG strategies than those who did not, but did not display a better understanding of gambling concepts. The relationship between GameSense awareness and self-reported use of RG strategies remained significant in multivariate analyses with covariates. Moderation analyses indicated that a positive effect of overall GameSense engagement on gambling literacy was only found for respondents who had attended a regional property, as compared to respondents who attended Las Vegas or metropolitan properties.

The data collection was carried out during the Italian lockdown, between April 1st and April 20th, 2020. This survey collected information about psychological and socioeconomic variables related to the COVID-19 emergency. Respondents filled out a battery of questionnaires that included five measures. Three of the measures were specifically developed by the authors: 1. Expected repercussions of COVID-19; 2. Forethought scale; and 3. Perceived financial resources. The two other measures were standardized questionnaires: the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory Short Version (ZTPI-short) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Data from tailored measures on the COVID-19 pandemic reflect people's beliefs about the future, in terms of expectation about the pandemic's effect, estimation of the time needed for the pandemic to resolve, and estimation of how long people could endure the lockdown situation from a financial perspective. The ZTPI questionnaire was administered to measure people's differences in terms of Deviation from Balanced Time Perspective (DBTP). The PANAS questionnaire, instead, was administered to investigate people's differences in terms of emotional mood states. The provided dataset could be useful to other researchers, considering that the data were collected during the lockdown imposed on Italian citizens to face the unprecedented emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are currently no known factors that predict response to therapy. METHODS This was a retrospective study aimed to evaluate treatment effect grade (TEG) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy and surgery at a single center. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of TEG, scaled from 0 to 3. RESULTS Fifty patients were identified. The majority were male (n = 33) and 50% were Hispanic. The most common regimens given were: 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (n = 23, 46%), epirubicin, cis- or oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or Xeloda (n = 8, 16%), and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (n = 9, 18%). Twenty-seven patients (55%) had complete or partial response to therapy (TEG 0-2), and 23 patients (46%) had no response (TEG 3). Of numerous variables analyzed, only race and SRC histology were associated with TEG. TEG was associated with disease free, but not disease specific survival. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, 46% of patients had no histologic response to therapy. SRC histology, and possibly race, should be considered in determination of optimal multidisciplinary regimens and in amount of therapy to be given upfront, as patients with SRC histology and those of non-Asian race are less likely to respond to standard regimens.","output":"Predictors and significance of histologic response to neoadjuvant therapy for gastric cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted undergraduate medical education.

This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","output":"Suddenly Becoming a \\"Virtual Doctor\\": Experiences of Psychiatrists Transitioning to Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decontaminating N95 respirators for reuse could mitigate shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We estimate that across all the cities, an underlying weighted risk-score can identify a total of approximately 12.65 million, 4.09 million and 1.34 million individuals who are at 2-, 5- and 10-fold higher risk, respectively, compared to the average risk for the US population.

Its association with frailty is less well-described, particularly in independent community-dwelling older adults. Although nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining bone and muscle health, the complex relationship between osteosarcopenia and nutrition in the pathogenesis of frailty remains to be elucidated. In this cross-sectional analysis of 230 independent, community-dwelling individuals (mean age 67.2  7.4 years), we examined the associations between osteosarcopenia with nutritional status and frailty, and the mediating role of nutrition in the association between osteosarcopenia and frailty. Osteosarcopenia was defined as fulfilling both the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 consensus definition (low relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass adjusted for height, in the presence of either of either low handgrip strength or slow gait speed) and T-score  ?2.5 SD on bone mineral densitometry. We assessed frailty using the modified Fried criteria and nutrition using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment. We performed multiple linear regression, followed by pathway analysis to ascertain whether nutrition mediates the relationship between osteosarcopenia and frailty. Our study population comprised: 27 (11.7%) osteosarcopenic, 35 (15.2%) sarcopenic, 36 (15.7%) osteoporotic and 132 (57.4%) normal (neither osteosarcopenic, sarcopenic nor osteoporotic). Osteosarcopenia ( = 1.1, 95% CI 0.86C1.4) and sarcopenia ( = 1.1, 95% CI 0.90C1.4) were significantly associated with frailty, but not osteoporosis. Nutrition mediated the association between osteosarcopenia and frailty (indirect effect estimate 0.09, bootstrap 95% CI 0.01C0.22). In conclusion, osteosarcopenia is associated with frailty and poorer nutritional status, with nutrition mediating the association between osteosarcopenia and frailty.

We aimed to assess which intervention components and contextual factors may contribute to the successful delivery and implementation of primary care-led post-diagnostic dementia care. METHODS Mixed-methods systematic review. We searched five databases (inception-March 2019) with reference list screening and citation tracking. We included studies evaluating post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care had a significant role in dementia care, which assessed one or more implementation elements (acceptability, feasibility, adoption, sustainability, reach, costs, appropriateness or fidelity). Two authors independently critically appraised studies. RESULTS Out of 4528 unique references, we screened 380 full texts and included 49 evaluations of services collecting implementation process data. Most services had high acceptability ratings. The most acceptable components were information provision, social and emotional support and links to community organisations. Feasibility was chiefly influenced by provider engagement and leadership, building dementia care capacity, sufficient resources/funding and collaboration. Care quality was maximised through adding capacity from a dementia-specific health professional. On the basis of limited data, costs for various primary care-led models did not substantially differ from each other. CONCLUSION A range of primary care-led dementia care models appear feasible and acceptable. Future services should: add dementia-focussed health professionals into primary care, develop primary care leadership and provide sufficient funding and collaboration opportunities. Information, community service links and social and ongoing support should be part of services.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the role of Sesn1 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury in vitro. The induction of Sesn1 was found in neurons exposed to OGD/R treatment. The silencing of Sesn1 rendered neurons more vulnerable to OGD/R injury, while the up-regulation of Sesn1 ameliorated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury by reducing apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the up-regulation of Sesn1 promoted the activity of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by down-regulating the expression of the Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). The restoration of Keap1 or the suppression of Nrf2 remarkably abolished the Sesn1-induced neuroprotection effects in OGD/R-exposed neurons. In summary, our work indicates that Sesn1 is a remarkable neuroprotective protein that potentiates Nrf2 activation via Keap1 to ameliorate OGD/R-induced injury.","output":"Sestrin1 exerts a cytoprotective role against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced neuronal injury by potentiating Nrf2 activation via the modulation of Keap1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thirty years ago, just three drugs were available for the treatment of viral infections, but now more than forty have been approved.

Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die.

However, a similar or weaker binding affinity of CoV-2-S compared to that of CoV-S is observed if entire spikes are used in the bioassay. To explore the underlying mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of the RBDs to ACE2 and simulated the transitions between ACE2-inaccessible and -accessible conformations.

Eighteen women and two men who had experienced chemosensory loss associated with COVID-19 participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five major themes. These confirmed that all participants had experienced an altered sense of smell (anosmia, and less frequently parosmia and phantosmia) of variable duration. Loss of taste (ability to detect sweetness, saltiness, etc.) was less common. Participants experienced decreased, no change or increased appetite, with six participants reporting weight loss. Consistent with evidence linking diminished appetite with inflammation, for two participants, decreased appetite preceded anosmia onset. Anosmia reduced enjoyment of food and drink. Compensatory strategies included choosing salty, sweet and spicy foods, and increased attention to food texture, and there was evidence that the postingestive rewarding effects of food intake were also important for maintaining appetite. Some participants mentioned increased alcohol intake, in part facilitated by reduced intensity of disliked flavours of alcoholic drinks.

Results: : of the 135 COVID-19 survivors among the 763 total participants, 40.7% had COVID-19-related sequelae. First, the results of the Bonferroni-corrected Mann Whitney U test showed that the group infected SARS-CoV-2 with sequelae scored significantly higher than those without sequelae and the non-infected group on all clinical symptom scales (P  .001). Next, there was a significant difference that incidence rates of clinical-significant psychiatric symptoms among each group from the results of the Chi-squared test (P  .001). Finally, the results of the multivariate logistic model revealed that the risk of having more severe clinical symptoms were 2.48C4.64 times higher among participants with sequelae. Conclusion: The results showed that approximately half had sequelae after COVID-19 and that the sequelae of COVID-19 may lead to the onset of mental disorders. Trial registration: The ethics committee of Chiba University approved this cross-sectional study (approval number: 4129). However, as no medical intervention was conducted, a clinical trial registration was not necessary.","output":"Impact of Sequelae Resulting From the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: a Cross-sectional Study in Japan and Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol abuse remains one of the primary preventable sources of mortality in the United States. Model species can be used to evaluate behavioral and other biological changes associated with alcohol and to identify novel treatments. This report describes methods for evaluating the behavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) in crayfish. Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) were immersed in ethanol concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 molar, for 10-30 min. Studies evaluated hemolymph alcohol concentration, locomotion in an open field and anxiety-like behavior using a Light/Dark transfer approach. EtOH immersion produced dose-dependent increases in hemolymph EtOH (up to 249 mg/dL) and reductions in open field locomotion that depended on EtOH concentration or exposure duration. Untreated crayfish exhibit avoidance of the open parts of the locomotor arena and a preference for a covered portion. Acute EtOH immersion decreased time spent in the covered portion of the Light/Dark arena, consistent with a decrease in anxiety-like behavior. Daily EtOH immersion for 5 days did not alter locomotor responses, however, activity was increased 3 days after the repeated EtOH regimen. Overall, this study shows that this inexpensive, easily maintained species can be used for behavioral pharmacological experiments designed to assess the acute and repeated effects of EtOH.","output":"Behavioral effects of ethanol in the Red Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To provide economic relief following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. CARES Act granted an extra $600 per week in unemployment insurance (UI) benefit payments from late March through July 2020. This unprecedented increase in UI generosity caused weekly benefit payments to exceed prior earnings for most recipients, raising concern that many would be unwilling to accept job offers, slowing the labor market recovery. To assess the impact of the UI supplement, we analyze the job acceptance decision in a dynamic framework in which job seekers weigh the value of a job against remaining unemployed, accounting for the perceived state of the labor market and expected weeks of UI benefits. We derive a reservation level of benefit payments at which an individual is indifferent between accepting and refusing a job offer at their prior wage. Calculating the reservation benefit and comparing it to imputed benefit payments for a wide range of U.S. workers suggests that only a small fraction would turn down an offer to return to work at their previous wage under the CARES Act expanded UI payments. We supplement this quantitative assessment of reservation benefits with direct empirical analysis of labor force transitions using matched Current Population Survey (CPS) data, linked to annual earning records from the CPS income supplement to form UI replacement rates. The results show moderate disincentive effects of the $600 supplemental payments on job finding rates and by extension small effects of the $300 weekly supplement available during 2021.","output":"Ui Generosity and Job Acceptance: Effects of the 2020 Cares Act"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La COVID-19 es la contraccin del nombre de la enfermedad nacida en diciembre de 2019 en la ciudad china de Wuhan originada por el virus SARS-CoV-2 y origen de la primera pandemia mundial del siglo XXI segn la OMS.

Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spread of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the pandemics course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations susceptibility to false claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between perceived believability of COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Our study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen corresponding fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals considered these rumors believable. A key finding of this research is that poorer regions were more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation; countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita showed a substantially higher prevalence of misinformation. We discuss implications of our findings to public campaigns that proactively spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic. We also defend that fact-checking platforms should prioritize claims that not only have wide exposure but are also perceived to be believable. Our findings give insights into how to successfully handle risk communication during the initial phase of a future pandemic.","output":"Misinformation, believability, and vaccine acceptance over 40 countries: Takeaways from the initial phase of the COVID-19 infodemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic seriously threatens general public health services globally This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on HIV Care Continuum in Jiangsu, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Malnutrition is associated with both under nutrition and over nutrition which causes the body to get improper amount of nutrients to maintain tissues and organ function. Under nutrition is the result of insufficient intake of food, poor utilization of nutrients due to illnesses, or a combination of these factors. The purpose of this study was to identify associated risk factors and assess the variation of underweight among under-five children of different regions in Ethiopia. Methods Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey (EDHS-2016) weight-to-age data for under-five children is used. In order to achieve the objective of this study; descriptive, single level and multilevel ordinal logistic regression analysis were used. Results From a total of 8935 children about 8.1% were severely underweight, 17.1% were moderately underweight and 74.8% were normal. The test of heterogeneity suggested that underweight varies among region and multilevel ordinal model fit data better than single level ordinal model. Conclusion Educational level of mother, religion, birth order, type of birth, sex of child, mother body mass index, birth size of child, existence of diarrhea for last two weeks before survey, existence of fever for last two weeks before survey, duration of breast feeding, age child and wealth index had significant effect on underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The finding revealed that among the fitted multilevel partial proportional odds model, the random intercept model with fixed coefficients is appropriate to assess the risk factors of underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The findings of this study have important policy implications.

Innovative gene expression-based approaches promise to deliver precise, fast, and clinically practicable diagnostic tools to bedside. This study aimed to validate the SepsisMetaScore, an 11-gene signature previously reported by our study group, in a representative longitudinal cohort of trauma patients. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING Surgical ICUs of the University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany. PATIENTS Critically ill patients with severe traumatic injuries. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Paired box gene (PAXgene) RNA blood tubes were drawn at predefined time points over the course of disease. The performance of the SepsisMetaScore was tested using targeted polymerase chain reaction and compared with Procalcitonin using area under the receiver operating characteristics analyses. The SepsisMetaScore showed significant differences between infected and noninfected patients (n = 52). It was able to accurately discriminate infectious from noninfectious acute inflammation with an area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-0.99) and significantly outperformed Procalcitonin (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.64) early in the course of infection (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the clinical utility for diagnosis of infections with higher accuracy using the SepsisMetaScore compared with Procalcitonin in a prospective cohort of severe trauma patients. Future studies should assess whether the SepsisMetaScore may substantially improve clinical practice by accurate differentiation of infections from sterile inflammation and identification of patients at risk for sepsis.

METHODS: An experimental design with successfully mated female rats were randomized into control and treatment groups. Phase 1 had 2 interventional arms while phase 2 had 3 interventional arms (12 rats/arm) besides control arm. In phase-1, pregnant females were dosed two SSDs(1000 mg/kg) on gestation days 1C5 whereas, in phase-2, on gestation days 6C19 to correlate the effect of the SSDs (500/1000/1500 mg/kg) consumption during different stages of pregnancy. Pregnant females were observed for clinical signs following treatment. The rats were sacrificed one day before expected day of delivery for evaluation. Pregnancy rate, gestation index, number of corpora lutea, and litter size were assessed. Foetuses were examined for sex, skeletal and soft tissue alterations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In phase 1, no appreciable findings were there with SSD exposure. In phase 2, intrauterine growth and survival of foetuses were affected when SSDs were administered during organogenesis period. Decreased number of live foetuses and increased incidence of early and late resorption, reduced fetal growth with significant alteration in skeleton and viscera were found in treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner.

This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound (LUS), an affordable, consumable-free point-of-care tool, for COVID-19 screening. Methods This prospective observational cohort included adults presenting with cough and/or dyspnea at a SARS-CoV-2 screening center of Lausanne University Hospital between March 31st and May 8th, 2020. Investigators recorded standardized LUS images and videos in 10 lung zones per subject. Two blinded independent experts reviewed LUS recording and classified abnormal findings according to pre-specified criteria to investigate their predictive value to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection according to PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (COVIDpos vs COVIDneg). We finally combined LUS and clinical findings to derive a multivariate logistic regression diagnostic score. Results Of 134 included patients, 23% (n=30/134) were COVIDpos and 77% (n=103/134) were COVIDneg; 85%, (n=114/134) cases were previously healthy healthcare workers presenting within 2 to 5 days of symptom onset (IQR). Abnormal LUS findings were significantly more frequent in COVIDpos compared to COVIDneg (45% versus 26%, p=0.045) and mostly consisted of focal pathologic B-lines. Combining LUS findings in a multivariate logistic regression score had an area under the receiver-operating curve of 63.9% to detect COVID-19, but improved to 84.5% with the addition of clinical features. Conclusions COVIDpos patients are significantly more likely to have lung pathology by LUS. Our findings have potential diagnostic value for COVID-19 at the point of care.

Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. METHODS: An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. RESULTS: In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.","output":"Social media as a recruitment platform for a nationwide online survey of COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices in the United States: methodology and feasibility analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: People with rheumatic diseases (PRD) remain vulnerable in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

Expert commentary: Currently available data seem to indicate that routine use of multiplex assays, including NxTAG RPP Assay, should be recommended only when epidemiological data concerning circulation of viruses and bacteria have to be collected. Their use in clinical practice seems debatable. They have limited sensitivity and specificity at least in the identification of some infectious agents or, as in the case of NxTAG RPP, they have not been evaluated in a sufficient number of patients to allow definitive conclusions. In the future, the clinical relevance of multiplex assays, including NxTAG RPP, could significantly increase, mainly because a number of new antiviral agents effective against several respiratory viruses for which no drug is presently available will be marketed.

Vaccines can contain killed or live (attenuated) microorganisms as well as fragments of these (antigens). Although many vaccines are used routinely in pregnancy to provide a seroprotective immune response for mother, fetus and neonate there is much controversy over their use during this unique time. The aim of the study was to find out about the knowledge of adult Poles on the use of preventive vaccinations during pregnancy. METHODS: The study involved 700 people (100%) aged 18 to 80 years ([Formula: see text] = 32.16  16.46). Most of the respondents were women (511; 73%). The study consisted of 9 questions about preventive vaccinations of pregnant women and 5 questions about members of the studied group. The aforementioned questions formed the basis of the preparation of the presented article. RESULTS: A significant part of respondents (322; 46%) did not have knowledge on the topic of safeness of using preventive vaccinations during pregnancy, 196 (28%) respondents believed that such procedure is not safe. Most of the respondents (371; 53%) did not know about the possibility of using live vaccines during pregnancy. 14 (2%) of respondents believed that pregnancy should be terminated in case of administration of a live vaccine to a pregnant woman. According to 294 (42%) respondents, vaccinations with live vaccines should be completed at least 3 months before the planned pregnancy. The subjects were not aware of the issue of post-exposure vaccination against tetanus and rabies among pregnant women. The respondents responses were divided on the issue of the safest trimester of pregnancy for vaccine administration. Almost 1/3 of the respondents (203; 29%) indicated the third trimester as the safest for their performance.

Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) is a secondary prevention model which identifies patients at risk for fragility fractures. The introduction of a FLS protocol showed an increase of anti-osteoporotic drug prescription and significant reduction of all-cause mortality. INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures are the most severe osteoporotic fracture due to their associated disability and elevated risk of mortality. FLS programs have enhanced the management of osteoporosis-related fractures. Our objective is to analyze the effect of the FLS model over survival and 2-year mortality rate following a hip fracture. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study on patients over 60 years of age who suffered a hip fracture during 3 consecutive years, before and after the implementation of the FLS in our center (i.e., between January 2016 and December 2018). Patients information was withdrawn from our local computerized database. Patients were followed for 2 years after the hip fracture. Mortality and re-fracture rates were compared between the two groups using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: A total of 1101 patients were included in this study (i.e., 357 before FLS implementation and 744 after FLS implementation). Anti-osteoporotic drugs were more frequently prescribed after FLS implementation (583 (78.4%) vs 44 (12.3%); p < 0.01). There was an increase of adherence to treatment after FLS implementation (227 (38.9%) vs 12 (3.3%); p = 0.03). A total of 222 (29.8%) patients after FLS implementation and 114 (31.9%) individuals before FLS implementation (p = 0.44) died during the follow-up period. A second fracture occurred in 49 (6.6%) patients after FLS implementation and in 26 (7.3%) individuals before FLS implementation (p = 0.65). Patients who were treated with anti-osteoporotic drugs after the implementation of the FLS protocol had a lower all-cause 1-year and 2-year mortality compared with patients managed before the implementation of the FLS protocol (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59C0.96; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69C1.09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a FLS protocol was associated with an increase of anti-osteoporotic treatment, higher adherence, and greater survival in elderly hip fracture patients. There was a significant reduction of all-cause mortality in the FLS patients treated with anti-osteoporotic.

DATA SOURCES We searched (from inception until April 27, 2020) Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened citations and manuscripts for eligible randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independently and in duplicate, we performed data abstraction, risk of bias assessment, and certainty assessment using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models or, if insufficient data, presented findings narratively. RESULTS We identified seven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,575). Pooled analysis demonstrated low certainty evidence for no difference of levetiracetam on time to seizure cessation (mean difference, -3.11 min; 95% CI, -6.67 to 0.45), early seizure cessation (relative risk, 1.09, 95% CI, 0.95-1.26), or late seizure cessation (relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93-1.18). Adverse event outcomes were limited by low event numbers. We found low certainty evidence for less respiratory depression with levetiracetam (relative risk, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69). CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of levetiracetam is comparable with phenytoin or fosphenytoin in children with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (low certainty evidence). Levetiracetam may cause less respiratory depression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded case fatality rates, calculated the sex difference in survival and used data from four recent studies to convert case fatality rates into age/sex-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs). We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the riskCbenefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01C46%). The risk was significantly higher with age and in men compared with women. 37.5% of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2018 had an IFR 5%. Survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from 5 to 10% in some common cancers, compared with the increased risk of death from COVID-19 of 0C3%. CONCLUSIONS: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19. Patients with cancer are also at a higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy.

While faculty and staff faced extraordinary demands in workplace duties, personal responsibilities also increased. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and professional activities of faculty and staff in order to illuminate current challenges and explore solutions. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured group interviews involved faculty and staff at four affiliate sites within the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado, School of Medicine. Focus groups addressed the impact of COVID-19 on (1) Changes to roles and responsibilities at work and at home, (2) Resources utilized to manage these changes and, (3) Potential strategies for how the Department could assist faculty and staff. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive method at the semantic level to form themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts revealed themes of: (1) Challenges and disparities experienced during the pandemic, (2) Disproportionate impact on women personally and professionally, (3) Institutional factors that contributed to wellness and burnout, and (4) Solutions and strategies to support faculty and staff. Within each of these themes were multiple subthemes including increased professional and personal demands, concern for personal safety, a sense of internal guilt, financial uncertainty, missed professional opportunities, and a negative impact on mentoring. Solutions were offered and included an emphasis on addressing preexisting inequities, the importance of community, and workplace flexibility.

In this report, we describe the behavior of preinjected FDG during PET CT-guided RFA of a non-small-cell lung carcinoma and discuss the value of FDG as a tool to provide intraprocedure monitor ablation. The size and the form of the activity changed during ablation. Ablation led to increase of the size and blurring and irregularity of the contour compared to pretreatment imaging. The maximal standardized uptake value decreased only slightly during the procedure. Therefore, before RFA, FDG PET can guide initial needle placement, but it does not serve as a monitoring tool to evaluate residual viable tissue during the procedure.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation of non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung under real-time FDG PET CT guidance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to develop a real-time geospatial surveillance system to monitor the spread of COVID-19 across the UK. Methods Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. Results We demonstrate that using a combination of crowd-sourced app data and sophisticated geo-statistical techniques it is possible to predict hot spots of COVID-19 at fine geographic scales, nationally. We are also able to produce estimates of their precision, which is an important pre-requisite to an effective control strategy to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. Conclusion In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","output":"Real-time spatial health surveillance: Mapping the UK COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebrovascular diseases are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, in particular those with large vessels occlusion (LVO).

A 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence (UUUAUAAAC), which is located immediately downstream of the leader at the 5' terminus of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic RNA, contains a sequence resembling the consensus intergenic sequence (UCUAAAC). It has been shown previously that the presence of the 9-nt sequence facilitates leader RNA switching and may enhance subgenomic mRNA transcription. It is unclear how the 9-nt sequence exerts these functions. In this study, we inserted the 9-nt sequence into a defective interfering (DI) RNA reporter system and demonstrated that mRNA transcription could be initiated from the 9-nt sequence almost as efficiently as from the intergenic sequence between genes 6 and 7. Sequence analysis of the mRNAs showed that the 9-nt sequence served as a site of fusion between the leaders and mRNA. The transcription initiation function of the 9-nt sequence could not be substituted by other 5'-terminal sequences. When the entire 5'-terminal sequence, including four copies of the UCUAA sequence plus the 9-nt sequence, was present, transcription could be initiated from any of the UCUAA copies or the 9-nt sequence, resulting in different copy numbers of the UCUAA sequence and the deletion of the 9-nt sequence in some mRNAs. All of these heterogeneous RNA species were also detected from the 5'-terminal region of the viral genomic-length RNA in MHV-infected cells. These results thus suggest tha the heterogeneity of the copy number of UCUAA sequences at the 5' end, the deletion of the 9-nt sequence in viral and DI RNAs, and the leader RNA switching are the results of transcriptional initiation from the 9-nt site. They also show that an mRNA species (mRNA 1) that lacks the 9-nt sequence can be synthesized during MHV infection. Therefore, MHV genomic RNA replication and mRNA 1 transcription may be distinguishable.","output":"A 5'-proximal RNA sequence of murine coronavirus as a potential initiation site for genomic-length mRNA transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While scholars have debated whether environmental factors (e.g., air pollution) can prompt unethical behavior (e.g., crime), we argue that the COVID\\\\19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to inform this theoretical debate by elaborating on why these effects may occur, identifying how they can be overcome, and addressing methodological issues.

There are several factors contributing to the state of health human resources in the country, but problems with governance stand out as one area requiring further research, analysis and critique. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of the historical patterns in national health human resources governance in South Africa, based on a desktop policy review spanning 25 years after democracy. The authors took a multi-pronged, iterative approach, reviewing policy documents alongside grey and published literature. This led to a timeline showing key legislation, relevant health system and human resource policies, interventions, reviews and evaluations from 1994 to 2018. The review identified three distinct periods that help to characterise the terrain of human resources for health governance over the concerned 25 years. Firstly, a foundational period, in which much of the constitutional and legislative groundwork was laid. Secondly, the HIV epidemic period, which presented a major disruption to the development of system wide governance interventions and improvements. Thirdly, the launch of National Health Insurance discussions and policy processes, which signalled a gradual return to a comprehensive systems focus in line with the founding principles of the first period. Using this periodisation, as well as a conceptual framework of health human resources governance functions based on international literature, the authors argue that South Africa has experienced both progress and challenges in human resources for health governance. This has affected the successful implementation of its policy and strategic planning over the past 25 years. Good governance for human resources for health requires capable stewardship, underpinned by an appropriate mix of technical and administrative skills and explicit political support. The review findings suggest that strengthening human resources for health governance roles, including fostering purposeful stewardship by the National Department of Health, may be key to shifting the terrain in the availability and performance of South Africas health workforce going forwards.","output":"Looking back to look forward: a review of human resources for health governance in South Africa from 1994 to 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent reclassification of formaldehyde as a presumed carcinogen prompted the investigation into the comparative efficacy of hydrogen peroxide as a fumigant in microbiological safety cabinets. INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to quantify the biocidal efficacy of formaldehyde fumigation, including variables such as exposure time and concentration, and then to compare this to the biocidal efficacy achieved from a hydrogen peroxide vapor fumigation system. The study also investigated the ability of both fumigants to permeate the microbiological safety cabinet (MBSC), including the workspace, under the work tray, and after the HEPA filters. Furthermore, the effect of organic soiling on efficacy was also assessed. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used as the biological target to develop this study model. METHODS: A model using IBV was developed to determine the efficacy of formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide as fumigants. Virus was dried on stainless steel discs, and variables including concentration, time, protein soiling, and location within an MBSC were assessed. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that formaldehyde fumigation could achieve a 6-log reduction in the titer of the virus throughout the cabinet, and high protein soiling in the presentation did not affect efficacy. Appropriate cycle parameters for the hydrogen peroxide system were developed, and when challenged with IBV, it was shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide could achieve an equal 6-log titer reduction as formaldehyde within the cabinet workspace and overcome the presence of soiling. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen peroxide was demonstrated to be a viable alternative to formaldehyde under most situations tested. However, the hydrogen peroxide system did not achieve an equal titer reduction above the cabinets first HEPA filter using the cabinet workspace cycle, and further optimization of the hydrogen peroxide cycle parameters, including pulsing of the cabinet fans, may be required to achieve this.","output":"Comparing the Efficacy of Formaldehyde with Hydrogen Peroxide Fumigation on Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses comprise a major class of human respiratory pathogens, responsible for causing morbidity and mortality worldwide.

A specific type of single cytosine insertion in the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the mucin 1 (MUC1) gene is the only known cause of MCKD1; however, genetic analysis of this mutation is difficult and not yet offered routinely. To identify the causative mutation/s and establish a definitive diagnosis in a Chinese family with chronic kidney disease, clinical assessments and genetic analysis were performed, including using a modified genotyping method to identify the MUC1- VNTR single cytosine insertion. METHODS Clinical data from three patients in a Chinese family with chronic kidney disease were collected and evaluated. Linkage analysis was used to map the causative locus. Mutation analysis of uromodulin (UMOD) gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. For MUC1 genotyping, the mutant repeat units were enriched by MwoI restriction, and then were amplified and introduced into pMD-18T vectors. The 192 clones per transformant were picked up and tested by colony PCR and second round of MwoI digestion. Finally, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the MUC1 mutation. RESULTS Clinical findings and laboratory results were consistent with a tubulointerstitial lesion. Linkage analysis indicated that the family was compatible with the MCKD1 locus. No mutations were found in UMOD gene. Using the modified MUC1 genotyping method, we detected the MUC1-VNTR single cytosine insertion events in three patients of the family; and mutation-containing clones were 12/192, 14/192, and 5/96, respectively, in the three patients.

Women reported that: smoking served as a coping mechanism for stress and facilitated socialization; stigmatization hindered quitting; non-stigmatizing counseling cessation support provided alternative coping strategies; and, with clinicians, the cessation opportunities TTTF presented are valuable. Clinicians reported organizational support, or lack thereof, and tobacco-related misconceptions as the main facilitator/barriers to treating tobacco addiction. Effective tobacco cessation interventions for women with SUDs should be informed by, and tailored to, their gendered experiences, needs, and recommendations.

Among 48 patients admitted to the ICU, about 24 (50%) patients had required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 11(29.9%) patients needed noninvasive ventilation, while 13(27.08%) patients treated with high-flow oxygen therapy >15 L/min (Table 3). Corticosteroids were administered to most patients (85.4%), while 77.1% of the patients received inhaled bronchodilators and morethan half of the patients administered antibiotics. 58.3% of the patients had received Oseltamivir, while 22.9% received Vasopressors. Conclusion: This study represents the first description of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICU in Somalia. The study identified that elder age, male gender, and diabetic and hypertensive comorbidities as independent risk factors of poor outcomes for patients admitted to the ICU (p<0.005).","output":"Clinical Characteristics, Comorbidities, Initial Management and Outcome of COVID-19 Infected Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Unit in Somalia: A National Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports an error in \\"When social isolation is nothing new: A longitudinal study psychological distress during COVID-19 among university students with and without preexisting mental health concerns\\" by Chloe A Hamza, Lexi Ewing, Nancy L Heath and Abby L Goldstein (Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne, Advanced Online Publication, Sep 07, 2020, np) In the article (http://dx doi org/10 1037/cap0000255), the title incorrectly read \\"When Social Isolation Is Nothing New: A Longitudinal Study Psychological Distress During COVID-19 Among University Students With and Without Preexisting Mental Health Concerns\\" due to a production related error All versions of this article have been corrected (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-66840-001 ) The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on college and university campuses internationally (e g , widespread campus closures, transitions to online learning) Postsecondary students, who were already a developmentally vulnerable population, are now facing additional new challenges, which could lead to increased mental health concerns However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19, or who may be most at risk, among postsecondary students To address these gaps in the literature, we recontacted a sample of 773 postsecondary students (74% female, Mage = 18 52) who previously completed a survey on student mental health in May 2019, again in May 2020 Students filled out an online survey at both time points, reporting on their recent stressful experiences and mental health Although we expected that students with preexisting mental health concerns would show increased psychological distress during the pandemic, this hypothesis was not supported Instead, repeated-measures analyses demonstrated that students with preexisting mental health concerns showed improving or similar mental health during the pandemic (compared with one year prior) In contrast, students without preexisting mental health concerns were more likely to show declining mental health, which coincided with increased social isolation among these students Our findings underscore that colleges and universities will not only need to continue to support students with preexisting mental health needs but also prioritize early prevention and intervention programming to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on students with increasing psychological distress, potentially stemming from increasing social isolation in response to the pandemic (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"When social isolation is nothing new: A longitudinal study psychological distress during COVID-19 among university students with and without preexisting mental health concerns.

Study Design: This was a prospective observational case-control study of infants born to women who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR at any time during their pregnancy (n=15). The study was carried out in a Tertiary University Maternity Hospital (8,500 deliveries/year) in Ireland. This study was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written consent was obtained. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery, full blood count and Calibrated Automated Thrombography were performed. Demographics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Healthy term infants, previously recruited as controls to a larger study prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, were the historical control population (n=10). RESULTS: Infants born to women with SARS-CoV-2 had similar growth parameters (birth weight 3600g v 3680g, p=0.83) and clinical outcomes to healthy controls, such as need for resuscitation at birth (2 (13.3%) v 1 (10%), p=1.0) and NICU admission (1 (6.7%) v 2 (20%), p=0.54). Haematological parameters (Haemoglobin, platelet, white cell and lymphocyte counts) in the COVID-19 group were all within normal neonatal reference ranges. Calibrated Automated Thrombography revealed no differences in any thrombin generation parameters (lag time (p=0.92), endogenous thrombin potential (p=0.24), peak thrombin (p=0.44), time to peak thrombin (p=0.94)) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this prospective study including eligible cases in a very large population of approximately 1500 women, there was no evidence of derangement of the haematological parameters or hypercoagulability in umbilical cord blood due to COVID-19. Further research is required to investigate the pathological placental changes, particularly COVID-19 placentitis and the impact of different strains of SARS-CoV-2 (particularly the B.1.1.7 variant) and the severity and timing of infection on the developing fetus.","output":"Haematological parameters and coagulation in umbilical cord blood following COVID-19 infection in pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a significant public health concern and causing a pandemic in the world. Despite immense attention to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), very little attention has been given to the kinetics of disease progression in infected patients. Therefore, in this study, we present a 14-day clinical observation of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients. METHODS: After recording the demography of 42 COVID-19 patients on day 1, we observed the clinical progression for 14 days by investigating the hematological and biochemical responses of patients blood and serum, respectively. RESULTS: Approximately, 62% of the hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients presented cough, followed by fever (52%). The top comorbidities of these patients were hypertension (30%) and diabetes mellitus (19%). The average blood hemoglobin (Hb) level was slightly low among the patients in the early days of infection and went up to the normal level on the later days. A substantial increase in the level of ALT or SGPT [up to 106 IU/L; standard error of the mean (SEM): 12.64] and AST or SGOT (up to 64.35 IU/L; SEM: 5.013) in COVID-19 patients was observed, which may suggest that infection with coronavirus is associated with the functionality of other organs of COVID-19 patients.

Our experience is consistent with the published scientific literature on the pandemic. A Medline search that we conducted in late September yielded over 23,000 English-language articles pertaining to COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of this strategy in Germany. Methods: This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. Results: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of supplying one additional ICU bed is 24,815 euros per life year gained and increases with the number of additional beds. The NMB remains positive for utilization rates as low as 1.5% and, assuming full capacity utilization, for multiples of the currently available bed capacity. Expanding the ICU bed capacity by 10,000 beds is projected to result in societal costs of 41 billion euros and to reduce mortality of ICU candidates by 20% compared with no intervention (assuming full capacity utilization). In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. Conclusions: In Germany, the provision of additional ICU bed capacity appears to be cost-effective over a large increase in the number of beds. Nevertheless, bed utilization is constrained by labor supply and possibly other input factors.","output":"How much reserve capacity is justifiable for hospital pandemic preparedness?

Few studies have investigated the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia, and the results have been inconsistent. In this study, the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia were investigated in terms of their utility as indicators for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. METHODS: Adult patients (18 years old) with CAP, tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory virus, at two teaching hospitals between October 2010 and May 2013, were identified retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data were collected by reviewing the hospital electronic medical records. RESULTS: During the study period, 456 patients with CAP were identified who met the definition, and 327 (72%) patients were tested using the respiratory virus PCR detection test. Viral pneumonia (n = 60) was associated with rhinorrhea, a higher lymphocyte fraction in the white blood cells, lower serum creatinine and ground-glass opacity (GGO) in radiology results, compared to non-viral pneumonia (n = 250) (p<0.05, each).

The most frequent PI in 34% (64/188) of cases was terminating a drug: 27.9% (29/104) for the COVID-19-positive group and 47.6% (40/84) for the COVID-19-negative group. The main drug classes involved were antithrombotic agents (20.7%, 39/188), antibacterials for systemic use (13.8%, 26/188) and drugs for gastric acid-related disorders (6.4%, 12/188). Study population was limited to a single centre over 1 month. CONCLUSION: No difference in PI was noted between the two groups. The presence of pharmacists led to a reduction in drug-related prescription problems, especially for antithrombotic and antibacterial drugs for both groups. Clinical pharmacy commitment in such a pandemic is therefore important.","output":"Analysis of clinical pharmacist interventions in the COVID-19 units of a French university hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The patients burden with asymptomatic meningiomas and patients with good clinical outcome after meningioma resection often remains neglected. In this study, we aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes of psychological distress and quality of life in these patient groups. METHODS: Patients with conservatively managed (CM) or operated (OM) meningiomas and excellent neurological status, who were screened for psychological distress during the follow-up visit (t1), were included. We performed a follow-up mail/telephone-based survey 3C6 months (t2) after t1. Distress was measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Distress Thermometer (DT), 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in t1 and 47 in t2. The number of patients reporting increased or borderline values remained high 3 months after initial presentation, with n = 25 (53%) of patients reporting increased anxiety symptom severity and n = 29 (62%) reporting increased depressive symptom severity values. The proportion of distressed patients according to a DT score remained similar after 3 months. Forty-four percent of patients reported significant distress in OM and 33% in CM group. The most common problems among distressed patients were fatigue (t2 75%) and worries (t2 50%), followed by pain, sleep disturbances, sadness, and nervousness. Tumor progress was associated with increased depression scores (OR 6.3 (1.1C36.7)). CONCLUSION: The level of psychological distress in asymptomatic meningiomas and postoperative meningiomas with excellent outcome is high.

To help clarify it, we proposed an integrated account of status and self-esteem, and tested several hypotheses derived from it. We distinguished between two types of status: socioeconomic status (SES; education, income, occupation) and sociometric status (SMS; respect, admiration, importance). We then examined how they related to one another and to self-esteem across five studies (N = 2,018). As hypothesized, in Studies 1-2 (cross-sectional), SES and SMS correlated positively with one another, and both correlated positively with self-esteem, yet SMS predicted self-esteem more strongly than SES did. Moreover, SMS mediated the link between SES and self-esteem, and this statistical model fit the data better than an alternative model where SMS and SES reversed roles. Studies 3-5 demonstrated causal links experimentally. In Study 3, manipulating SES to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) SMS and state self-esteem, with SMS again statistically mediating the impact of SES on state self-esteem. In Study 4, manipulating SMS to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) state self-esteem. Finally, in Study 5, manipulating SMS showed that it causally mediated the link between SES and state self-esteem. Our findings persisted across multiple measurement formats and after controlling for the Big Five personality traits. They point to SMS being a more powerful and proximate predictor of self-esteem than SES, thereby illuminating the link between status and self-esteem, and adding to a growing literature on the psychology of status.

In many medical schools this has prompted additions to curricula that allow students to explore the gray-as opposed to the black and white-areas of medicine through arts, humanities, and social sciences. As curricula have expanded and diversified in this way, both medical educators and students have begun to ask: what is the best way to teach medical humanities? EVIDENCE In this article, five current medical students reflect on their experiences of medical humanities teaching through intercalated BSc programmes in the UK. What follows is a broad exploration of how the incorporation of medical humanities into students' time at university can improve clinical practice where the more rigid, objective-driven, model of medicine falls short. IMPLICATIONS This article reinforces the merit of moving beyond a purely biomedical model of medical education.

Methods: PubMed search of 2020 literature on public health and epidemiology informatics was conducted and all retrieved references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 15 candidate best papers were selected among the 920 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by the two section editors, two chief editors, and external reviewers, including at least two senior faculty, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook to make an informed decision regarding the selection of the best papers. Results: Among the 920 references retrieved from PubMed, four were suggested as best papers and the first three were finally selected. The fourth paper was excluded because of reproducibility issues. The first best paper is a very public health focused paper with health informatics and biostatistics methods applied to stratify patients within a cohort in order to identify those at risk of suicide; the second paper describes the use of a randomized design to test the likely impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-management elements, on patient consultations or antibiotic requests for influenza-like illnesses. The third selected paper evaluates the perception among communities of routine use of Whole Genome Sequencing and Big Data technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information. Conclusions: The findings from the three studies suggest that using Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics methods could leverage, when combined with Deep Learning, early interventions and appropriate treatments to mitigate suicide risk.

The unavailability of approved therapeutic agents or vaccines is of great concern. This study performed molecular docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) analysis of some compounds isolated from Neocarya macrophylla (Sabine) Prance ex F. White (Chrysobalanaceae) against three targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (3C-like protease, spike protein, and papain-like protease). Materials and Methods: Phytoconstituents isolated from N. macrophylla were screened against key targets of SARS-CoV-2 using Auto Dock Vina, while the ADMET analysis was performed using swiss ADME and pkCSM ADMET descriptors algorithm protocols. Results: The in silico computational studies revealed that the compounds (catechin, catechin-3-rhamnoside, quercetin, and epicatechin) isolated from N. macrophylla can effectively bind with high affinity and lower energy values to the three target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. ADMET analysis was used to predict important pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds, such as aqueous solubility, blood-brain barrier, plasma protein binding, CYP2D6 binding, intestinal absorption, and hepatotoxicity.

Methods Patients who underwent direct EC-IC bypass surgery agreed to sonolucent cranioplasty at the time of surgery and received a sonolucent polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) implant. Besides monitoring clinical outcome, all patients received trans-cranioplasty ultrasound (TCUS) on postoperative day 1 and at last follow-up. In addition, bypass patency was confirmed using catheter angiogram and fit of implant using computed tomography (CT). Patient-rated outcome was assessed through phone-questionnaire. Results EC-IC bypass surgery with PMMA cranioplasty was successful in all 7 patients with patent bypasses on postoperative angiogram. Direct TCUS was feasible in all patients and bypass patency was monitored. There were no complications such as postoperative hemorrhagic/ischemic complications related to the bypass procedure in this patient population as well as also no complications related to the PMMA implant. Postoperative CT showed favorable cosmetic result of the PMMA implant both in the pterional area for STA-MCA bypasses as well as the parieto-occipital area for OA-MCA bypasses as confirmed by high rated overall patient satisfaction with favorable cosmetic, pain and sensory patient-rated outcome.

However, preventing the contamination of HCWs and the environment during PPE removal crucially requires improved strategies. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of three PPE ensembles, namely, Hospital Authority (HA) Standard Ebola PPE set (PPE1), Dupont Tyvek Model, style 1422A (PPE2), and HA isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol-generating procedures (PPE3) to prevent EVD transmission by measuring the degree of contamination of HCWs and the environment. METHODS: A total of 59 participants randomly performed PPE donning and doffing. The trial consisted of PPE donning, applying fluorescent solution on the PPE surface, PPE doffing of participants, and estimation of the degree of contamination as indicated by the number of fluorescent stains on the working clothes and environment. Protocol deviations during PPE donning and doffing were monitored. RESULTS: PPE2 and PPE3 presented higher contamination risks than PPE1. Environmental contaminations such as those originating from rubbish bin covers, chairs, faucets, and sinks were detected. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing, with PPE1 presenting the lowest overall deviation rate (%) among the three PPE ensembles (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Contamination of the subjects working clothes and surrounding environment occurred frequently during PPE doffing. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing. Although PPE1 presented a lower contamination risk than PPE2 and PPE3 during doffing and protocol deviations, the design of PPE1 can still be further improved. Future directions should focus on designing a high-coverage-area PPE with simple ergonomic features and on evaluating the doffing procedure to minimise the risk of recontamination. Regular training for users should be emphasised to minimise protocol deviations, and in turn, guarantee the best protection to HCWs.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012C2018 were tested. RESULTS: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26C17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Laos public. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012C2018.

The purposes of this study aim to investigate the prevalence of burnout syndrome in practitioners, residents and nurses working in the psychiatric hospital of Tunisia. It also aims to investigate the relationship between burnout, depression, and a variety of personal variables, including age, gender, marital, parental and personal difficulties within this population. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among the nursing staff (n=54), residents (n=41) and practitioners (n=11) in Razi hospital in Tunisia. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Beck depression inventory and a general questionnaire on demographic data were used. RESULTS High levels of burnout were detected among nurses. This was true for the emotional tiredness sub-scale (mean score: 26.18); the depersonalization subscale (mean score: 10.20) and for the alteration of personal achievements (mean score: 32.94). High scores in emotional tiredness were correlated to depression (P=0.000; R=0.56) and to personal difficulties (P=0.021; R=0.31) in this group. Residents showed high scores in personal achievements (mean score: 32.56), and practitioners did not reach the cutoff scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. CONCLUSION Our results are somewhat comparable to those of studies in other countries. Burnout syndrome was highly prevalent among nurses and residents.

As many grain exporting countries announced a ban on grain exports, food security issues in China have attracted a significant international attention. Based on the Suitability Distribution Model and Soybean-Cereal Constraint Model, we explored the relationship between soybean production potential and food security. We calculated that the soybean potential planting area in China is 164.3 million ha. If the outbreak prevents China from importing soybeans, soybean planting area will need to be increased by 6.9 times to satisfy the demands. In the meantime, cereal self-sufficiency rate will drop to 63.4%, which will greatly affect food security. Each additional unit of soybean production will reduce 3.9 units of cereal production, and 1% increase in the self-sufficiency rate of soybean will result in a 0.63% drop in the self-sufficiency rate of cereal. Without sacrificing the self-sufficiency rate of cereal, the self-sufficiency rate of soybean is limited to 42%. Consequently, China will still need to import more than 68% of the current import volume of soybean. Although in the short term, the outbreak will not affect food security in China, as soybean imports decrease, insufficient supply of soybeans will affect people's quality of life. To prevent the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, China should increase soybean stocks and strengthen international cooperation. In the long term, increasing the self-sufficiency rate is a fundamental solution to solving soybean import dependency.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine application may be associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients and what is potential mechanism. Design, Setting and Patients: This retrospective study included all 568 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by pathogen laboratory tests despite antiviral treatment and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, PAO2/FIO2 <300 with need of mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, between February 1 of 2020 to April 8 of 2020. All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days). Primary endpoint is mortality of patients, and inflammatory cytokines levels were compared between hydroxychloroquine and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death and hospital stay time (day) were obtained, level of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) was measured and compared between HCQ and NHCQ treatments. RESULTS: The median age of 568 critically ill patients is 68 (57, 76) years old with 37.0% being female. Mortalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group and 45.8% (238/520) in NHCQ group (p<0.001).

Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\\\\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p<0.01$), with the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These results indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of influenza like illnesses, including COVID 19, and support social distancing as an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Fever and mobility data indicate social distancing has reduced incidence of communicable disease in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To assess the clinical and biological effect of locally-administered controlled-release 10 % doxycycline hyclate gel in smokers and non-smokers for the management of periodontitis. Methods: Forty periodontitis patients were enrolled in this study from December 2012 to February 2013 at the Department of Periodontology and Implantology of the Institute of Dental Sciences and Dental Unit of Rohilkhand Medical College, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. For each patient, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and sulcular bleeding index (SBI) were recorded. Changes in microbial counts were assessed by measuring colony-forming units (CFU) of three major periodontal pathogens. Clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline and one month after scaling and root planing plus controlled local drug delivery of 10 % doxycycline hyclate gel in smokers and non-smokers. Results: A statistically significant change (p < 0.01) in PPD was observed among smokers between baseline (4.26 +/- 0.12mm) and re-evaluation at one month (3.20 +/- 0.11) with a change of 24.88 %. A statistically significant difference was found between smokers and non-smokers in PPD at the end of a 1-month re-evaluation (p < 0.05). None of the other parameters showed improvement in smokers following treatment. Conclusion: These results indicate that 10 % doxycycline hyclate gel, when administered locally into the periodontal pocket, shows clinical and microbial improvement, among smokers and non-smokers, in the management of periodontitis. Therefore, 10 % doxycycline gel is potentially an effective therapeutic strategy in the management of periodontitis.","output":"Evaluation of locally-administered controlled-release doxycycline hyclate gel in smokers and non-smokers in the management of periodontitis: An Indian study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the diversification and rapid development of society, people's living conditions, learning and friendship conditions, and employment conditions are facing increasing pressure, which greatly challenges people's psychological endurance. Therefore, strengthening the mental health education of students has become an urgent need of society and a hot issue of common concern. In order to solve the problems of high misjudgment rate and low work efficiency in the current mental health intelligence evaluation process, a mental health intelligence evaluation system based on a joint optimization algorithm is proposed. The joint optimization algorithm consists of an improved decision tree algorithm and an improved ANN algorithm. First, analyze the current research status of mental health intelligence evaluation, and construct the framework of mental health intelligence evaluation system; then collect mental health intelligence evaluation data based on data mining, use joint learning algorithm to analyze and classify mental health intelligence evaluation data, and obtain mental health intelligence evaluation results. Finally, through specific simulation experiments, the feasibility and superiority of the mental health intelligent evaluation system are analyzed. The results show that the system in the article overcomes the shortcomings of the existing mental health intelligence evaluation system, improves the accuracy of mental health intelligence evaluation, and improves the efficiency of mental health intelligence evaluation.

In this study, we sought to estimate the influence of pregnant women's fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on their choice of provider, mode of childbirth, and length of stay (LOS) for the delivery during and after the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. METHODS: The National Health Insurance data from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2003 were used. A population-based descriptive analysis was conducted to assess the changes in volume, market share, cesarean rate, and average LOS for each of the 4 provider levels, before, during and after the SARS epidemic. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-SARS period, medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share for childbirth services during the peak SARS period, while district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1%, respectively. For changes in cesarean rates, only a significantly larger increase was observed in medical centers (2.2%) during the peak SARS period. In terms of LOS, significant reductions in average LOS were observed in all hospital levels except for clinics. Average LOS was shortened by 0.21 days in medical centers (5.6%), 0.21 days in regional hospitals (5.8%), and 0.13 days in district hospitals (3.8%). CONCLUSION: The large amount of patients shifting from the maternity wards of more advanced hospitals to those of less advanced hospitals, coupled with the substantial reduction in their length of maternity stay due to their fears of SARS could also lead to serious concerns for quality of care, especially regarding a patient's accessibility to quality providers and continuity of care.","output":"The immediate effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic on childbirth in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, we conducted a systematic review using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and bibliographies of identified papers following PRISMA guidelines including data from observational studies of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers and pooled with multicenter data to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for acute stroke related to COVID-19 severity using random effects model.

The social context predicts the intensity of sexual selection due to its effect on mate choice and intra-sexual competition. Moreover, it exacerbates the costs derived from sexual conflict and allows for the existence of alternative reproductive tactics to counteract such costs. However, these mechanisms are still underexplored in many animal taxa. Majoidea \\"spider crabs\\" show a diversity of life history, and behavioral and morphological adaptations for reproduction, which have evolved as an outcome of competition to maximize reproductive success. We aimed to analyze in this study, male reproductive strategies through mating behavior under different social contexts, density of individuals, and males size differences in two species of \\"spider crabs\\", Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa. The experiments were as follows: one female and one male per aquarium (Experiment 1); a female and three males of similar sizes per aquarium (Experiment 2); and a female and three males of distinct sizes per aquarium (Experiment 3). The experiments showed that mating behavior and duration of mate guarding differ between species and among different social contexts. The presence of males with similar or different sizes showed a relevant different behavior, the female copulated with more than one male when males were similar in size (E2), and copulated only with the largest male when males were different in size (E3). In mate guarding, the shape and the use of the chelipeds had an important role: the male of Leurocyclus tuberculosus grasped the female with the chelipeds and did not fight with other males, but the male of Libinia spinosa surrounded the female with the chelipeds and fought with other males. The longest duration of mate guarding was during precopulatory guarding. Precopulatory guarding was present in all the experiments and its duration did not present significant differences among the experiments. However, in both species, the experiments differ in the duration of postcopulatory guarding until spawning. Gonopod morphology revealed important differences between species and are probably associated with sperm competition. The experiments under distinct social contexts linked to the use and shape of the chelipeds and the morphology of the gonopods, could allow to understand the functional significance of the different reproductive strategies.","output":"Male reproductive strategies in two species of spider crabs, Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobility is considered one of the main reasons for the COVID-19 spread.

Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to \\"flatten the curve\\" of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the individual and combined effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed, and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate and diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. We estimate that a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing alone is estimated to delay (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) but not to reduce the peak. The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses are limited in that they do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adoption of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.","output":"Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government-imposed social distancing on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic: A modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health-promotion interventions incorporating wearable technology or eHealth apps can encourage participants to self-monitor and modify their physical activity and sedentary behavior. In 2020, a Calgary (Alberta, Canada) recreational facility developed and implemented a health-promotion intervention (Vivo Play Scientist program) that provided a commercially available wearable activity tracker and a customized eHealth dashboard to participants free of cost. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to independently evaluate the effectiveness of the Vivo Play Scientist program for modifying physical activity and sedentary behavior during the initial 8 weeks of the piloted intervention. METHODS: Our concurrent mixed methods study included a single-arm repeated-measures quasiexperiment and semistructured interviews. Among the 318 eligible participants (18 years of age) registered for the program, 87 completed three self-administered online surveys (baseline, T(0); 4 weeks, T(1); and 8 weeks, T(2)). The survey captured physical activity, sedentary behavior, use of wearable technology and eHealth apps, and sociodemographic characteristics. Twenty-three participants were recruited using maximal-variation sampling and completed telephone-administered semistructured interviews regarding their program experiences. Self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior outcomes were statistically compared among the three time points using Friedman tests. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview data. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 39.8 (SD 7.4) years and 75% (65/87) were women. Approximately half of all participants had previously used wearable technology (40/87, 46%) or an eHealth app (43/87, 49%) prior to the intervention.

Significant differences in physical activity and sitting between time points were found among subgroups based on the household composition, history of wearable technology use, and history of eHealth app use. Participants described how wearing the Vivofit4 device was beneficial in helping them to modify physical activity and sedentary behavior. The social support, as a result of multiple members of the same household participating in the program, motivated changes in physical activity. Participants experienced improvements in their mental, physical, and social health. CONCLUSIONS: Providing individuals with free-of-cost commercially available wearable technology and an eHealth app has the potential to support increases in physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in the short term, even under COVID-19 public health restrictions.","output":"Effectiveness of an 8-Week Physical Activity Intervention Involving Wearable Activity Trackers and an eHealth App: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past two years and coinciding with a curricular change in our Pharmacy program, we planned a partial shift for our physiology content moving from lecture-based physiology topics to an active learning setting Part of these active learning activities using a gamification process were presented last year together with student assessments (EB 2020 poster: Tejada-Simon and Silverthorn;?Low-tech? gamification and TBL strategies to teach physiology) With the current COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transform the newly developed TBL and game session to a new and engaging system for the online world The task required more effort than originally predicted, as instructors were trying to learn new technological skills at the same time than developing new materials The goals for those new materials were to conserve equivalency and reusability for future academic years, as well as possible application to all, face-to-face, hyflex, hybrid and online delivery systems Our learning objective was to assist first year Pharmacy students in understanding the autonomic nervous system structure and function using an interactive approach coupled to a team-based learning session The original 2-hour session was converted to a 3-hour interactive problem-solving game (InProGAME) As in prior years, the students completed pre-class activities in form of diagrams, crossword puzzles and fill-in the blank to engage them with anatomical terminology and function During the InProGAME, the whole class (123 students) met first in a Zoom room to discuss foundational learning, followed by 15 breakout Zoom rooms with eight students/group to facilitate small group interaction and initiate the collaborative/active learning part of the session Group learning activities mainly included the use of Jamboards and Wisc-Online, with instructor facilitation Jamboard is an interactive whiteboard system with compatibility for online collaboration and more capabilities than Google docs Students worked together in real time using these boards with instructor supervision and feedback Wisc-Online is an open educational resource library that contains a game builder platform to create educational games designed to reinforce learning, allowing friendly competition if desired To evaluate the success of this approach on student learning we will discuss our grading rubric, post-session assessments, student evaluation/survey, as well as faculty peer observation and evaluation","output":"Physiology going viral: Redesigning active learning instruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses particular challenges for people working in the medical sector. Some of the medical students and young medical professionals who are starting their work in healthcare facilities during this time are confronted with extraordinary moral challenges. A portion of them does not yet have sufficient coping skills to adequately deal with these challenges. This can lead to so-called moral distress (MoD). Permanent or intensive exposure to MoD can have serious consequences. Appropriate support services have the potential to improve the handling of MoD. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on MoD among medical students and young medical professionals in order to sensitize lecturers with responsibility for education and training and doctors in leading positions to the problem. MAIN PART: This article presents the scientific concept of MoD, known triggers, and options for prevention and intervention. The topic is presented with reference to the changes in patient care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and research needs are presented. CONCLUSION: The article illustrates the necessity of a German-language, interdisciplinary discourse on MoD among medical students and young professionals.","output":"Moralischer Stress bei Medizinstudierenden und ?rztlichen Berufseinsteigenden: Forschungsdesiderate im Rahmen der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk. Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, which inappropriately disfavors older adults. This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. Members of the AGS Ethics Committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports. The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and de\\\\emphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age. The AGS positions include: (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential short\\\\term (not long\\\\term) outcomes; (4) avoiding ancillary criteria such as life\\\\years saved and long\\\\term predicted life expectancy that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning.

Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. METHOD: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults.

Nucleic-acid-based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection of COVID-19. However, the gold standard test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply, and relatively scarce qPCR machines. It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude. There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the gold-standard CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles. Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own laboratories.

The objectives of this study were to assess: (1) the effects of the Dutch lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 on trust in government and trust in science; and (2) whether these differ across social groups. We draw on unique data from the high-quality Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, which comprises a true probability sample of Dutch households (average participation rate: 80.4%). Our data were collected on an ongoing basis from December 2017 to March 2020 (n = 2219). Using the implementation of lockdown measures in mid-March as a natural experiment, we employed difference-in-differences analyses to assess the causal effect of the Dutch lockdown measures on trust in government and trust in science. We estimated that the imposition of the measures caused an 18% increase (95% confidence interval (CI):15%-21%)) in trust in government and a 6% increase (95% CI: 4%-8%) in trust in science. The impact on trust in government was greater among the participants aged 65 and older and those with poor self-assessed health, although the relevant CIs were wide and, in the case of self-assessed health, included the null. No differential effects were observed for trust in science. Our study indicates that the strict public-health measures imposed in the Netherlands during an acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic generated trust in the institutions involved in drafting and implementing them, especially among those with a higher risk of serious health outcomes. This suggests that, to prevent a major public-health crisis, people appreciate firm government intervention during the acute phase of an infectious disease pandemic.","output":"Dutch COVID-19 lockdown measures increased trust in government and trust in science: A difference-in-differences analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread in Italy in late February 2020. Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies. The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations. METHODS: Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases. Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted. Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers. In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine. The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped. Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment. The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients. Strategies to protect health care workers against COVID-19 infection and to identify asymptomatic infected surgeons were suboptimal with respect to the WHO recommendations in 70.4% and 90.2% of centers, respectively. Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers. DISCUSSION: This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy. Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay. Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.

MethodsThis study was conducted in December 2020 and February 2021. The participants had undergone a preliminary survey, which revealed that they were in good mental health. Their psychological distress was investigated via a second survey, and the factors associated with distress were studied using a logistic model. ResultsThe results of the second survey indicated that 15.1% of participants demonstrated psychological distress. This was associated with leave-of-absence instructions, instructions for shortening business hours, and requests to avoid the workplace in case of any symptoms. ConclusionThe study found that while some infection control practices reduce workers distress, others worsen it. Employers need to consider infection control practices as well as the worsening mental health of employees following a decrease in income caused by such measures.

Although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in Central and, recently, West Africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in Central Africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses.

Lung histological samples were scarce due to the high risk of contamination during autopsies. We aimed to correlate histological COVID-19 features with radiological findings through lung ultrasound (LU)-guided postmortem core needle biopsies (CNBs) and computerized tomography (CT) scans. METHODOLOGY: We performed an observational prospective study, including 30 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19. The thorax was divided into 12 explorations regions to correlate LU and CT-scan features. Histological findings were also related to radiological features through CNBs. RESULTS: Mean age was 62.56  13.27 years old, with 96.7% male patients. Postmortem LU-guided CNBs were performed in 13 patients. Thirty patients were evaluated with both thoracic LU and chest CT scan, representing a total of 279 thoracic regions explored. The most frequent LU finding was B2-lines (49.1%). The most CT-scan finding was ground-glass opacity (GGO, 29%). Pathological CT-scan findings were commonly observed when B2-lines or C-lines were identified through LU (positive predictive value, PPV, 87.1%). Twenty-five postmortem echo-guided histological samples were obtained from 12 patients. Histological samples showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (75%) and chronic interstitial inflammation (25%). The observed DAD was heterogeneous, showing multiple evolving patterns of damage, including exudative (33.3%), fibrotic (33.3%), and organizing (8.3%) phases. In those patients with acute or exudative pattern, two lesions were distinguished: classic hyaline membrane; fibrin plug in alveolar space (acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, AFOP). C-profile was described in 33.3% and presented histological signs of DAD and lung fibrosis. The predominant findings were collagen deposition (50%) and AFOP (50%). B2-lines were identified in 66.7%; the presence of hyaline membrane was the predominant finding (37.5%), then organizing pneumonia (12.5%) and fibrosis (37.5%). No A-lines or B1-lines were observed in these patients. CONCLUSION: LU B2-lines and C-profile are predominantly identified in patients with severe COVID-19 with respiratory worsening, which correspond to different CT patterns and histological findings of DAD and lung fibrosis.","output":"Radio-Histological Correlation of Lung Features in Severe COVID-19 Through CT-Scan and Lung Ultrasound Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Single port laparoscopic access could reduce morbidity associated with additional trocar placement and, through the development of a hybrid intermediate, facilitate the clinical adoption of evolving techniques such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Advanced trocar technology, as much as adapted surgical technique, seems necessary to best facilitate this, however. METHODS A novel port (Airseal, Surgiquest) that uses vortex technology to create an air-curtain seal to maintain the pneumoperitoneum while facilitating the simultaneous passage of multiple working instruments was trialed. For this, 6 pigs (30 kg each) underwent sigmoid resection and reanastomosis using the port as the sole laparoscopic access for conventional instrumentation. All animals were thereafter survived for observation during a 2-week convalescence before undergoing repeat general anesthesia, sigmoidoscopy for anastomotic assessment, and forensic laparotomy for determination of intraperitoneal healing and complications. RESULTS The operation was technically feasible via a single port within a short time in every animal (mean duration 12.3 minutes). One anastomosis had to redone because of staple misfire but this too was accomplishable without additional port placement. All animals survived and convalesced normally without evincing clinical complication. At follow-up, all anastomoses were patent at sigmoidoscopy and only 1 animal had evidence of complicated anastomotic healing (the same animal that had needed anastomotic refashioning).

METHODS: We analyzed a total of sixty outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were divided according to sex. Afterward, a questionnaire was carried out to find out their symptoms and comorbidities. Additionally, blood biometry data were correlated with the Ct value, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty patients were analyzed; the mean age was 43 years. All patients were from Nayarit, Mexico.

The two types of AR STAT1 defect give rise to a broad infectious phenotype with susceptibility to intramacrophagic bacteria (mostly mycobacteria) and viruses (herpes viruses at least), due principally to the impairment of IFN--mediated and IFN-/-mediated immunity, respectively. Clinical outcome depends on the extent to which the STAT1 defect decreases responsiveness to these cytokines. AD STAT1 deficiency selectively predisposes individuals to mycobacterial disease, owing to the impairment of IFN--mediated immunity, as IFN-/-mediated immunity is maintained. Finally, AD gain of STAT1 activity is associated with autoimmunity, probably owing to an enhancement of IFN-/-mediated immunity. More surprisingly, it is also associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, through as yet undetermined mechanisms involving an inhibition of the development of IL-17-producing T cells.

General surgery has been affected in elective procedures, yet the implications for emergency surgery are unclear. The current study analyzes the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 on appendicitis treatment in Germany. METHODS: Hospitals that provided emergency surgical care during the COVID-19 lockdown were invited to participate. All patients diagnosed with appendicitis during the lockdown period (10 weeks) and, as a comparison group, patients from the same period in 2019 were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters, intraoperative and pathological findings, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1915 appendectomies from 41 surgical departments in Germany were included. Compared to 2019 the number of appendectomies decreased by 13.5% (1.027 to 888, p=0.003) during the first 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. The delay between the onset of symptoms and medical consultation was substantially longer in the COVID-19 risk group and for the elderly. The rate of complicated appendicitis increased (58.2 to 64.4%), while the absolute number of complicated appendicitis decreased from 597 to 569, (p=0.012). The rate of negative appendectomies decreased significantly (6.7 to 4.6%; p=0.012). Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality, however, did not change. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown had significant effects on abdominal emergency surgery in Germany. These seem to result from a stricter selection and a longer waiting time between the onset of symptoms and medical consultation for risk patients. However, the standard of emergency surgical care in Germany was maintained.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used commercial claims data from the US MarketScan(?) Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 influenza seasons. Patients with a billed diagnosis of influenza and with coverage for at least 1 household member under the same health plan policy were included. A secondary diagnosed case was defined as a diagnosis of influenza in a second household member occurring within 14 days of the index case in a household. RESULTS: Among 1,224,808 households with 2 members and a primary case of influenza, a secondary case of influenza was reported in 119,883 households (9.8%). A secondary diagnosed case of influenza occurred within 4 days of the primary diagnosis in 93,883 (78.3%) of those households. Both primary and secondary diagnosed influenza cases occurred most often among children (~60%). Household size was positively correlated to both the risk of a second case (6.4% of households with 2 or 3 members versus 12.6% of households with 4 members, P < 0.001) and the time to diagnosis of a second case (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.09; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Claims data for 3 influenza seasons (2014, 2015, 2016) showed that intrahousehold transmission of influenza occurs in approximately 10% of households with a primary case and poses a higher burden on larger households. Intrahousehold transmission of influenza represents a large healthcare resource use burden, with an unmet need for interventions that limit transmission.","output":"Healthcare Resource Use and Burden Associated with Influenza Transmission Among Household Members with a Primary Infection: Commercial Claims Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International commerce and travel have been restricted in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. The illegal trafficking in drugs, which is often concealed in other commercial activity, will be affected by these disruptions. This is particularly true for precursor chemicals, controlled substances of synthetic origin, and new psychoactive substances coming from Asia. China hosts large and under-regulated pharmaceutical and chemical sectors that provide many of the active ingredients used both in legitimate medicines and illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine. Unregulated producers and vendors in China have been supplying drug trafficking organizations in Mexico or using the internet and postal service to directly sell fentanyl to buyers in North America. The magnitude of supply shortages and interrupted trade of chemicals and synthetic drugs coming from China will depend on the breadth and depth of COVID-19s disruptions. In turn, this could impact vulnerable drug-using populations. Drawing on historical accounts of prior supply disruptions, this commentary offers some initial speculation as to the possible effects of COVID-19 on the supply of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and precursor chemicals supplied to North America from China, which may have important lessons for other parts of the globe. Prior supply disruptions coincided with elevated prices and reduced purities of street drugs as well as increases in the number of users entering treatment. However, it is challenging to predict how developments will unfold given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic. A short-term breakdown in supply chains, interrupted trade, or social distancing mandates may not have much of an effect on the availability of synthetic drugs. Yet, disruptions in trade for months or years could shape how drugs are supplied or used. Drug policy will need to evaluate market indicators as soon as they are available but responding now with expanded medication therapies, like methadone, may help save lives. The drug policy landscape could look different in a post-COVID world.","output":"Supplying synthetic opioids during a pandemic: An early look at North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education is a sector that needs to go on to operate countinously as a means of student's activity and development in covid-19 pandemic Multimedia is the best solution for managing PE class not to stop despite the social distancing issue The aduance of technology in digitalization era isn't an obstacle to on going learning activities Advance multimedia facility could surely be able to answer the problem arising in the society related to physical activity carried out as a form of learning The efectiveness of multimedia learning can be seen from its trancendency to attract student's attention and interest as it combines the views, sound, and movement So that learning takes place attractively and easily remembered by the students ?

The most recent literature points to troubling evidence that policies adopted to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have contributed to diverting eating habits toward a poorer diet. Considering the historically unique SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown scenario, and the health burden imposed by UPFs on human health, it is critical to investigate how the epidemic has influenced UPF intake directly. Reviewing the literature, we aimed to assess the changes in the consumption of UPFs during the pandemic lockdown compared to previous habits in the general population. Methods: Consulting six databases, we examined articles investigating the consumption of UPFs according to the NOVA classification both before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and during lockdowns. In total, 28 reports were included in the final analysis. Results: A clear trend of an increasing consumption of sweets (chocolate, candy, cookies, pastries, cakes, desserts, and confectionery, 31.75% increase vs. 21.06% decrease), packaged fatty or salty snacks (23.71% increase vs. 20.73% decrease), and baked goods (bread products, pizza, and sandwiches, 28.03% increase vs. 13.5% decrease) emerged, versus a decrease in ready-to-eat dishes (16.2% increase vs. 22.62% decrease) and ready-made meals (10.6% increase vs. 31.43% decrease), such as instant soups, canned foods, fast food, and chips, as well as sugary drinks in general (14.55% increase vs. 22.65% decrease). No trend was observed for processed meat consumption. Conclusion: The current pandemic scenario raises concerns about the increased consumption of UPFs, especially sweets, snacks, and baked goods, and points to an urgent need to implement policy strategies to manage the trade in these foods from a preventive perspective.","output":"Public Health Response to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Concern about Ultra-Processed Food Consumption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome that is characterized by an inappropriate hyperinflammatory immune response C primary, as a consequence of a genetic defect of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes or C secondary, in the progression of infections, rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, malignancies or metabolic diseases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. RESULTS: A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A + B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 177.00 (N = 131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type.

The original trial protocol was published in Trials (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-1917-4 ). This included recruitment in two cohorts, enabling the learning from the smaller first cohort to be incorporated in the second cohort. Here we describe final amendments to the study protocol and discuss their underlying rationale. METHODS: Four major changes were introduced into the study protocol: (1) there were changes in eligibility criteria, including a clearer operational definition to assess the degree of SEL implementation in schools, and also new criteria to avoid experimental contamination; (2) the number of schools and pupils that had to be recruited was increased based on what we learned in the first cohort; (3) some changes were made to the secondary outcome measures to improve their validity and ability to measure constructs of interest and to reduce the burden on school staff; and (4) the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic both influences and makes it difficult to interpret the 2-year follow-up primary endpoint results, so we changed our primary endpoint to 1-year follow-up.

STHs disproportionately impact socio-economically disadvantaged communities including minority indigenous populations. This systematic review aimed to quantify the prevalence of STH infection within minority indigenous populations of the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a published protocol. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of STH infection, and meta-regression analysis was used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Where comparative data were available, sub-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of STH infection in minority indigenous people relative to other population groups. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated visually using Forest plots and was assessed quantitatively by the index of heterogeneity (I(2)) and Cochran Q-statistics. RESULTS: From 1,366 unique studies that were identified, 81 were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of infection within minority indigenous populations was 61.4% (95% CI 50.8, 71.4) for overall STH infection; 32.3% (95% CI 25.7, 39.3) for Ascaris.lumbricoides; 43.6% (95% CI 32.6, 54.8) for Trichuris.trichiura; 19.9% (95% CI 15.7, 24.5) for hookworm and 6.3% (95% CI 3.2, 10.2) for Strongyloides.stercoralis.

This received view, however, requires revision. When attempting to convert Hausdorffs principle into a conservation theorem, we have indeed found out that maximal chains are more reminiscent of maximal ideals than it might seem at first glance. The latter live in richer algebraic structures (rings), and thus are readier to be put under computational scrutiny. Exploiting the newly discovered analogy between maximal chains and ideals, we can carry over the concept of Jacobson radical from a ring to an arbitrary set with an irreflexive symmetric relation. This achievement enables us to present a generalisation of Hausdorffs principle first as a semantic and then as a syntactical conservation theorem.

Due to their involvement in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes and their accessibility, GPCRs are widely used as pharmacological targets of treatment. Orphan G protein-coupled receptors (oGPCRs) are GPCRs for which no natural ligands have been found, and they not only play important roles in various physiological functions, such as sensory perception, reproduction, development, growth, metabolism, and responsiveness, but are also closely related to many major diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Recently, many studies have reported that oGPCRs play increasingly important roles as key factors in the occurrence and progression of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, oGPCRs are likely to become potential therapeutic targets and may provide a breakthrough in the study of autoimmune diseases. In this article, we focus on reviewing the recent research progress and clinical treatment effects of oGPCRs in three common autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), shedding light on novel strategies for treatments.","output":"The Roles of Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Autoimmune Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Characterize the quality of life and depressive symptoms of university students in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the associated factors. Methods Multi-centre study in 1634 university students recruited by convenience sampling. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at three levels (EQ-5D-3L) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionarie-9 (PHQ-9). To evaluate factors associated with QoL and depressive symptoms, linear and adjusted regressions were used, with robust variance reporting coefficients (). Results The percentage of participants most affected by QoL dimension was: anxiety/depression (47.2%) and pain/discomfort (35.6%). Regarding the Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) of QoL, the score was 76.0 + 25.6. Those who had family economic decline during quarantine (=-3.4, IC95%=-6.5 to ?0.3) or family with chronic diseases (=-3.7, IC95%=-6.1 to ?1.4) presented significantly lower scores in their QoL. Regarding depressive symptomatology, the university students reported a moderate to severe level (28.9%). A higher risk of depressive symptoms was found in residents of Ayacucho (=0.8, IC95%=0.1 to 1.5), those who were released from quarantine (=0.7, IC95%=0.2 to 1.2) and those who had a family member with chronic disease (=1.5, IC95%=1.0 to 2.1). Conclusions Almost half and one third of participants reported anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort in their QoL respectively. Nearly a third presented moderate and severe depressive symptoms. The deterioration of QoL was worse in those who had a decrease in income and a family member with chronic illness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We electronically searched for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies published between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2019 evaluating the effect of interventions on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) control. Characteristics of included studies and HbA1c difference between intervention and control arms (main outcome) were extracted. Interventions were grouped as: care management and patient education; nurse or certified diabetes educator (CDE); pharmacist; or physician-based. RESULTS Thirty-six studies including 22 243 individuals were combined in nonlinear random-effects meta-regressions; the median (range) duration of intervention was 1 year (0.9 to 36 months). Compared to the control arm, HbA1c reduction ranged from: -17.7 mmol/mol (-1.62%) to -4.4 mmol/mol (-0.40%) for nurse- or CDE-based interventions; -13.1 mmol/mol (-1.20%) to 3.3 mmol/mol (0.30%) for care management and patient education interventions; -9.8 mmol/mol (-0.90%) to -6.6 mmol/mol (-0.60%) for pharmacist-based interventions; and -4.4 mmol/mol (-0.40%) to 2.8 mmol/mol (0.26%) for physician-based interventions. Across the included studies, a reduction in HbA1c was observed only during the first year (6 months: -4.2 mmol/mol, 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.2, -2.2 [-0.38%, 95% CI -0.56, -0.20]; 1 year: -1.6 mmol/mol, 95% CI -3.3, 0.1 [-0.15%, 95% CI -0.30, 0.01]) and in individuals with preintervention HbA1c >75 mmol/mol (9%).

In clinical samples, the perception of stress is a strong predictor of anhedonia. While there is substantial evidence demonstrating psychotherapy reduces perceived stress, little is known regarding the effects of treatment-related decreases in perceived stress on anhedonia. Methods The current study investigated reciprocal relations between perceived stress and anhedonia using a cross-lagged panel model approach in a 15-week clinical trial examining the effects of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA), a novel psychotherapy to treat anhedonia, compared to a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) comparison intervention (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT02874534 and NCT04036136). Results Treatment completers (n=72) experienced significant reductions in anhedonia (M=-8.94, SD=5.66) on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (t(71)=13.39, p<.0001), and significant reductions in perceived stress (M=-3.71, SD=3.88) on the Perceived Stress Scale (t(71)=8.11, p<.0001) following treatment. Across all treatment-seeking participants (n=87), a longitudinal autoregressive cross-lagged model revealed significant paths showing that higher levels of perceived stress at treatment Week 1 predicted reductions in anhedonia at treatment Week 4. Conclusions Longitudinal models illustrated that individuals with relatively high perceived stress at the start of treatment were likely to report relatively lower anhedonia a few weeks into treatment. At mid-treatment, individuals with low perceived stress were more likely to report lower anhedonia towards the end of treatment. Early treatment components are thought to reduce perceived stress, allowing for mid-to-late treatment components to exert their direct effects on anhedonia. The findings presented here demonstrate the importance of including stress-reducing components in cognitive-behavioral-based anhedonia treatments.","output":"Longitudinal associations between perceived stress and anhedonia during psychotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a common and morbid disease that affects patients' quality and length of life, representing a large portion of health care expenditure in the United States. These patients commonly have associated diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with high rates of cardiovascular-related death. Management of ESKD requires renal replacement therapy via dialysis or transplantation. While transplantation provides the greatest improvement in survival and quality of life, the vast majority of patients are treated initially with hemodialysis. However, outcomes differ significantly among patient populations. Barriers in access to care have particularly affected at-risk populations, such as Black and Hispanic patients. These patients receive less pre-ESKD nephrology care, are less likely to initiate dialysis with a fistula, and wait longer for transplants-even in pediatric populations. Priorities for ESKD care moving into the future include increasing access to nephrology care in underprivileged populations, providing patient-centered care based on each patient's \\"life plan,\\" and focusing on team-based approaches to ESKD care.

MethodsWe investigated the proportions of SARS-CoV-2 positive or COVID-19 patients in people with NF1, NF2, or SWN in the National COVID Collaborative Cohort (N3C) electronic health record dataset. ResultsThe cohort sizes in N3C were 2,501 (NF1), 665 (NF2), and 762 (SWN). We compared these to N3C cohorts of other rare disease patients (98 - 9844 individuals) and the general non-NF population of 5.6 million. The site- and age-adjusted proportion of people with NF1, NF2, or SWN who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or were COVID-19 patients (collectively termed positive cases) was not significantly higher than in individuals without NF or other selected rare diseases. There were no severe outcomes reported in the NF2 or SWN cohorts. The proportion of patients experiencing severe outcomes was no greater for people with NF1 than in cohorts with other rare diseases or the general population.

B6 broadly neutralizes entry of pseudotyped viruses from lineages A and C, but not from lineage B, and the latter includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and membrane fusion assays reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery.

The aim was to examine unscheduled care pathways and the associations with mortality in people admitted with MI. METHODS: Retrospective population study of all people admitted to Scottish hospitals with a diagnosis of MI between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017. Linked data for all National Health Service Scotland unscheduled care services (NHS24 telephone triage service, primary care out of hours, ambulance, emergency department (ED)) was used to define continuous unscheduled care pathways (pathways), which were categorised by initial contact, and whether they were 'direct' (had minimum number of contacts between first contact and admission). Analysis estimated ORs and 95% CIs in adjusted models in which all covariates were included. RESULTS: 26 325 people admitted with MI (63.1% men, 61.6% aged 65+ years), of whom 5.6% died from coronary heart disease within 28 days. For 47.0%, the first unscheduled care contact was ambulance, 23.3% attended ED directly and 18.7% called telephone triage. 92.1% of pathways were direct. Pathways starting with telephone triage were more likely to be indirect compared with other initial contacts (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.97, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.40). Compared to direct pathways, indirect pathways starting with telephone triage were associated with higher mortality (aOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.40) as were indirect pathways starting with another service (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.01), but not direct pathways starting with telephone triage (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.02). CONCLUSION: Unscheduled care pathways leading to admission with MI in Scotland are usually direct, but those starting with telephone triage were more commonly indirect.

As one of the largest video-sharing platforms globally, YouTube is increasingly being used to provide educational content. With additional emphasis placed on these videos, there will likely have an impact on training progression further down the line. This research aims to evaluate YouTube video content as a microsurgical training information source. METHOD: We searched Youtube.com for videos demonstrating and teaching microsurgical techniques. Search terms included microsurgical, teaching, anastomosis and flap. All videos of neurosurgical nature were excluded. Thirty-one videos were evaluated using nine criteria and using a modified GQS score. To reduce duplication, included videos were limited to two from one source. RESULTS: Initial results show 79% of the videos were GQS Score 4/5 and therefore of good quality, despite only 38.7% featuring human procedures. 82.8% of the videos found were from medical websites, with most generated from three independent sources. The highly-scoring YouTube videos tended to have an audio voice-over or subtitles and clearly described the instruments and materials used. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that high-quality videos are easily accessible on YouTube and deemed useful as educational tools. However, trainees should be aware that varied sources provide videos that range in quality; and the learning acquired may not directly correspond to learning objectives set out by governing bodies and is unlikely to be comparable to real-life observation in theatre.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients health status was remotely monitored through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), resting or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, sleep oximetry, and cardiorespiratory polysomnography performed in community pharmacies or general practitioners offices. Patients also monitored their blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), body temperature, body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, and lipids at home through a dedicated smartphone app. All data conveyed to the web-based telehealth platform were used to manage critical patients by doctors promptly. Data were analyzed and compared across three consecutive periods of 2 months each: i) before the national lockdown, ii) during the lockdown (from March 9 to May 17, 2020), and iii) after the end of the containment measures. Overall, 13,613 patients visited community pharmacies or doctors offices. The number of overall tests dropped during and rose after the lockdown. The overall proportion of abnormal tests was larger during the outbreak. A significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal ECGs due to myocardial ischemia, contrasted by a significantly improved BP control, was observed. The number of home users and readings exchanged increased during the pandemic. In 226 patients, a significant increase in the proportion of SpO(2) readings and a significant reduction in the entries for all other parameters, except BP, was observed. The proportion of abnormal SpO(2) and BP values was significantly lower during the lockdown. Following the lockdown, the proportion of abnormal body weight or waist circumference values increased.

We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms. This paper highlights the need for inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary research capable of providing a rigorous and holistic assessment of the harms and benefits of lockdown.","output":"Lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: A rapid study of nine countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many organizations have issued recommendations to limit elective surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We surveyed providers of childrens surgical care working in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to understand their perspectives on surgical management in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they were subsequently modifying their surgical care practices. METHODS: A survey of childrens surgery providers in LMICs was performed. Respondents reported how their perioperative practice had changed in response to COVID-19. They were also presented with 26 specific procedures and asked which of these procedures they were allowed to perform and which they felt they should be allowed to perform. Changes in surgical practice reported by respondents were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: A total of 132 responses were obtained from 120 unique institutions across 30 LMICs. 117/120 institutions (97.5%) had issued formal guidance on delaying or limiting elective childrens surgical procedures. Facilities in LICs were less likely to have issued guidance on elective surgery compared with middle-income facilities (82% in LICs vs 99% in lower middle-income countries and 100% in upper middle-income countries, p=0.036). Although 122 (97%) providers believed cases should be limited during a global pandemic, there was no procedure where more than 61% of providers agreed cases should be delayed or canceled. CONCLUSIONS: There is little consensus on which procedures should be limited or delayed among LMIC providers. Expansion of testing capacity and local, context-specific guidelines may be a better strategy than international consensus, given the disparities in availability of preoperative testing and the lack of consensus towards which procedures should be delayed.","output":"Perspectives on perioperative management of childrens surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events, including stroke. However, characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with stroke are not well known. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study of risk factors, stroke characteristics, and short-term outcomes in a large health system in New York City. We included consecutively admitted patients with acute cerebrovascular events from March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Data were stratified by COVID-19 status, and demographic variables, medical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, imaging results, and in-hospital outcomes were examined. Among COVID-19-positive patients, we also summarized laboratory test results. RESULTS Of 277 patients with stroke, 105 (38.0%) were COVID-19-positive. Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a cryptogenic (51.8% versus 22.3%, P<0.0001) stroke cause and were more likely to suffer ischemic stroke in the temporal (P=0.02), parietal (P=0.002), occipital (P=0.002), and cerebellar (P=0.028) regions. In COVID-19-positive patients, mean coagulation markers were slightly elevated (prothrombin time 15.43.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.624.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.41.3). Outcomes were worse among COVID-19-positive patients, including longer length of stay (P<0.0001), greater percentage requiring intensive care unit care (P=0.017), and greater rate of neurological worsening during admission (P<0.0001); additionally, more COVID-19-positive patients suffered in-hospital death (33% versus 12.9%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Baseline characteristics in patients with stroke were similar comparing those with and without COVID-19. However, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to experience stroke in a lobar location, more commonly had a cryptogenic cause, and had worse outcomes.","output":"Acute Cerebrovascular Events With COVID-19 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corporate governance is a buzzword not only at the national but at the international level as well.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of teaching environmentsincluding leadership development trainings for post-graduate learnershave been thrust into exploring the virtual learning environment more thoroughly. One three-year leadership development program for interdisciplinary healthcare professionals transitioned three simultaneous leadership intensives from in-person to online in the spring of 2020. METHODS: Documented changes in overall training length, session length, and session format are described. Further, evaluative data were collected from participants at both retreats via post-session surveys. Ninety-three participants attended the 2019 retreat, and 92 participants attended the 2020 virtual retreat. Quantitative data of three rating questions per session are reported: 1) overall session satisfaction, 2) participants reported knowledge gain, and 3) participants reported ability gain. Qualitative data were obtained via two open-ended feedback questions per session. RESULTS: In comparing pre/post scores for knowledge and ability, participants had meaningful (and in some cases higher) self-reported gains in knowledge and ability measures in the online environment, as compared to the in-person environment. Participants reported statistically significant gains in all sessions for both knowledge and ability. Qualitative data of participant feedback identified a number of positive themes similar across the in-person and virtual settings. Negative or constructive feedback of the virtual setting included time constraint issues (eg too much content in one session, a desire for more sessions overall), technical difficulties, and the loss of social connection and networking with fellow participants as compared to in-person trainings. DISCUSSION: While meaningful shifts in knowledge and ability ratings indicate that the transition to successful online learning is possible, several disadvantages remain. The preparation time for both faculty and participants was considerable, there is a need to reduce overall content in each session due to time restraints, and participants indicated feeling the loss of one-on-one connections with their peers in the training. Lessons learned of transitioning leadership training from in-person to an online experience are highlighted.","output":"Training Pivots from the Pandemic: Lessons Learned Transitioning from In-Person to Virtual Synchronous Training in the Clinical Scholars Leadership Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All papers published in this volume of IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science have been peer reviewed through processes administered by the Editors Reviews were conducted by expert referees to the professional and scientific standards expected of a proceedings journal published by IOP Publishing ?

Owing to the pandemic in South Korea, most medical schools needed to be flexible when conducting online and offline classes, but the guidelines did not reflect the specificity of medical schools. This study described the impact of modified anatomy education schedules at the Seoul National University College of Medicine (SNUCM) on students academic performance and satisfaction. METHODS: Anatomy education in SNUCM is divided into three regional units (the upper and lower limbs, trunk, and head and neck). Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the schedule was mixed with simultaneous and rotating schedules. The authors conducted exceptions for online lectures, cadaver dissections, and written and practical examinations in three classes of approximately 50 students each. Furthermore, the authors assessed students performance using three sets of written and practical examinations, and students completed a questionnaire regarding modified anatomy laboratory schedules. RESULTS: Despite the pandemic events in Seoul and South Korea during the laboratory sessions, all sessions were completed without any confirmed COVID-19 cases among the students, faculty, and staff. Most of the scores on the written and practical examinations significantly decreased in 2020 compared to those in 2019. However, in the trunk session that used the virtual anatomy application, the score on the practical examination in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019. Over 70% (79 and 77 out of 105 respondents on the upper and lower limbs and trunk, respectively) and 53% (55/105) students reported that there were no significant difficulties in studying anatomy in a face-to-face laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, an adequate education program for cadaver dissection should be developed and provided to overcome the pandemic restrictions. The study findings could serve as a reference for anatomy education during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of the modified schedules of anatomy education on students performance and satisfaction: Responding to COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indonesias financial markets and monetary policy dynamics.

We examine Bank Indonesias (BI)'s three monetary policy instruments: (1) BI 7-day Reverse Repo Rate (the policy rate); (2) minimum reserve requirement ratios for banks (GWM); and (3) BIs monetary operations. We find that several policy instruments have significant impacts on specific financial markets before and during the pandemic, i.e., the policy rate on the IDR and USD interbank money market, the IDR GWM on the medium-term SUN market, and the foreign exchange (FX) GWM on the FX market. We also find that the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the impacts of BIs policy instruments on particular financial markets during the pandemic than the pre-pandemic period.

In Italy, it was first and only identified in July 2019 in our hospital (San Martino Hospital, Genoa), where infection or colonization cases have been increasingly recognized during the following months. To gain insights into the introduction, transmission dynamics, and resistance traits of this fungal pathogen, consecutive C. auris isolates collected from July 2019 to May 2020 (n = 10) were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and antifungal susceptibility testing (AST); patients' clinical and trace data were also collected. WGS resolved all isolates within the genetic clade I (South Asian) and showed that all but one were part of a cluster likely stemming from the index case. Phylogenetic molecular clock analyses predicted a recent introduction (May 2019) in the hospital setting and suggested that most transmissions were associated with a ward converted to a COVID-19-dedicated ICU during the pandemic. All isolates were resistant to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and fluconazole at high-level, owing to mutations in ERG11(K143R) and TACB1(A640V). Present data demonstrated that the introduction of MDR C. auris in Italy was a recent event and suggested that its spread could have been facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our objective was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on AI for primary care. METHODS: We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published or gray literature databases with terms pertaining to AI (eg, machine learning, bayes* network) and primary care (eg, general pract*, nurse). We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by 7 attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS: Of 5,515 unique documents, 405 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%).

Here we report early results from the first-in-human multicenter clinical study (NCT04236011;NCT04182581) to determine safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of BCMA-CD19-directed FasT CAR-T (GC012F) in patients with R/R MM. Methods The BCMA-CD19 dual CAR was constructed by linking BCMA and CD19 scFv, joined by a CD8 hinge, transmembrane domain, co-stimulatory domain and CD3z. Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells were obtained by leukapheresis, T cells were isolated and CAR-T cells were manufactured (FasT CAR platform). From September 2019 to April 2020, we enrolled 16 heavily pretreated R/R MM patients (Age range 27-71), with a median of 5 prior lines of therapies (range 2-7), 93.8% (15/16) of these patients were high risk as defined by mSMART criteria, 5 had extramedullary disease. 4 out of 16 patients had received prior anti CD38 therapy, 93.8% (15/16) patients had received prior IMiD, all patients received at least 1 prior PI and corticosteroids with 3 patients being primary refractory to last therapy. Prior to CAR-T infusion patients received a conditioning regimen over 3 days of 30 mg/m2/d fludarabine and 300 mg/m2/d cyclophosphamide. CAR-T cells were administered in a single infusion at 3 dose levels 1x105/Kg (DL1) (1 patients), 2x105/Kg (DL2) (9 patients) and 3x105/Kg (DL3) (6 patients). Results As of July 17th 2020, all 16 patients were evaluable for response assessment, 15 out of 16 patients responded to treatment (ORR 93.8%) in all dose levels with the earliest response observed at day 28. Best response to date is MRD- CR/sCR in 9/16 patients (56.3%). In DL3 100% (6/6) of patients achieved sCR, 3 at data cut off had been confirmed by PET-CT. In all response evaluable patients, 78.6% (11/14) were MRD- by flow at month 1, and 100% at month 3 (11/11) and 6 (10/10) (sensitivity by flow cytometry measured at 10-4 in 7 patients, and at 10-6 in 9 patients tested by EuroFlow with at least 1.08x107 cells analyzed). At data cut off, the median follow up time was 7.3 months, the longest follow up was 10 months post infusion. CAR-T PK in PB was monitored by qPCR and flow cytometry. The CAR-T median proliferation peak was reached on Day10 (Day8-Day14), and the median peak copy number was 140,982 (16,011-374,346) copies /ug DNA. GC012F showed an acceptable safety profile with 14 out of 16 patients experiencing a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 1-2 (n=14, 87.5%) and 2 grade 3 (n=2, 12.5%). The median duration of CRS was 4 days (1-8 days). No neurotoxicity of any grade was observed. One patient (DL2) presented with fever and died shortly after Day 78 of unknown cause during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Two patients had progression of extramedullary disease while achieving MRD negativity at month 1 and 3, respectively. At landmark analysis at 6 months, all patients in DL3 had achieved and maintained MRD- sCR including patients heavily pretreated including Daratumumab - among them 83.3% (5/6) patients in DL3 had high risk features according to mSMART criteria, and 5 out of 6 patients in DL3 were assessed by 10-6 Euroflow for MRD. The study is still enrolling patients and we will continue to be monitoring safety and efficacy including duration of response. Conclusion The data of BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T showed an early and high response rate with 93.8% ORR to date with a promising early high MRD-sCR rate in the highest dose level DL3 (100%) which was sustained with a median duration of follow up of 7.3 months at cut off. The data shows very promising activity of the BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T with a favorable safety profile in R/R MM patients. 93.8% (15/16) of the treated patients exhibited high risk features - a specifically difficult to treat patient population which remains a high unmet medical need in Mul iple Myeloma. This data indicates that BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T (GC012F) may present an effective new treatment option for patients with R/R MM including those with high-risk features who failed multiple prior therapies including anti-CD38. The study is still ongoing and enrolling patients, we will update the results as they become available. Disclosures: Zhao: Gracell Biotechnologies Ltd: Current Employment.

We recently reported increased service use in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March to 15 April 2020), and a small increase in anxiety symptoms. This follow-up paper examines trends in service use and symptoms, over 12 weeks from 19 March to 10 June 2020. Methods Demographics, symptoms, and psychosocial stressors were compared for participants starting an online assessment over four time-periods: A baseline Comparison period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 to 28 September 2019), Weeks 1 - 4 of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (19 March - 15 April 2020), Weeks 5 C 8 (16 April C 13 May 2020) and Weeks 9 - 12 (14 May C 10 June). Responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 and strategies used by participants to improve their mental wellbeing are also reported. Results A total of 5,455 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot from 19 March to 10 June 2020. The number of assessments per week rose steadily from 303 in week 1 to a peak of 578 in week 5. Symptoms of anxiety were highest in Weeks 1 - 4, declining steadily over subsequent weeks. Psychological distress and depression, as measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9 respectively, remained stable. Concern about COVID-19 was highest in the first week then steadily declined during the following weeks. The proportions of participants reporting changes to routine were consistent across the 12 weeks, and most participants reported adopting helpful strategies to improve their mental wellbeing. Conclusions We observed an initial increase in service use, which reduced over the 12 weeks. The initial rise in anxiety symptoms returned to baseline. Reported concern about the effect of COVID-19 declined steadily over 12 weeks. Symptoms of psychological distress and depression measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9, and the proportion reporting suicidal thoughts and plans did not change, and to date we have not identified indications of a mental health crisis. However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the economy and large sections of society are yet to be fully realised, indicating the importance of ongoing monitoring and reporting of trends as indicators of the mental health of the nation.","output":"Rapid Report 2: Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first 12 weeks of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accidental strangulation due to scarf getting caught in the wheels of a vehicle or machine was called Isadora Duncan Syndrome or Long Scarf Syndrome.

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 39-year-old female who suffered accidental strangulation caused by the scarf around her neck getting trapped in the wheels of the a vehicle and was referred to our hospital forty days post injury. The CT examination showed a fracture dislocation at C5/6 levels with complete dissociation of the supporting structures. She developed paravertebral abscesses, cutaneous fistulas and oesophageal perforation confirmed by oesophagoscope. The patient was treated conservatively because of poor general condition and inappropriate initial treatment. Halo-vest was used to immobilize the cervical spine. The oesophagus-cutaneous fistula was managed with enteral tube feeding and repeated local care. The patient survived despite such severe injury. Nine months after the injury, the oesophageal perforation closed spontaneously and fixed malunion of the cervical spine was achieved. Six-year follow-up demonstrated that the patient survived with complete C5 tetraplegia. Literature associated with this lesion was reviewed and factors contributing to the survival were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant fracture dislocation of cervical spine and oesophageal perforation following Long Scarf Syndrome is extremely rare with high risk of mortality. Though surgical intervention is always necessary, the optimal management for this kind of lesion should be made on an individual basis through a multidisciplinary approach.","output":"Six-year follow-up of a survivor of cervical spine fracture and dislocation with oesophageal perforation following long scarf syndrome - a case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory synt drome (SARS) was spread by international air travel, a direct result of globalization.

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an intrasaccular braided device, recently approved by the FDA for treatment of WNBAs. While treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the WEB device has been shown to yield an adequate occlusion rate of 85% at 1 year, few data have been published for patients with ruptured aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To present a multi-institutional series depicting the safety and efficacy of using the WEB device as the primary treatment modality in ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted, assessing patients presenting with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with the WEB between January 2014 and April 2020. Baseline demographics, aneurysm characteristics, adverse events, and long-term outcomes (occlusion, re-treatment, functional status) were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed, and variables potentially associated with aneurysm recurrence or re-treatment were assessed. RESULTS Forty-eight patients were included. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms were the most common (35.4%) location for treatment, followed by middle cerebral artery (20.8%) and basilar apex (16.7%). Procedural success was noted in 95.8% of patients, and clinically significant periprocedural adverse events occurred in 12.5%. After a median follow-up of 5.5 months, 54.2% of patients had follow-up angiographic imaging. Complete occlusion was seen in 61.5% of cases with adequate occlusion in 92.3%. Re-treatment was required in only 4.2% of patients during the study period. Tobacco use was significantly higher in patients with aneurysm recurrence (88.9% vs 35.7%; p=0.012). No other characteristics were associated with recurrence/re-treatment. At 30 days, 81.1% were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score 2). CONCLUSION Treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysms with the WEB device demonstrates both safety and efficacy on par with rates of conventional treatment strategies.","output":"Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device in the treatment of ruptured aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the role of specialist research libraries both in highlighting open-access resources and in developing and maintaining community online during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We compared patients who continued to receive scheduled impact of intravitreal treatment without clinical consultation (Group Continue ?C; n = 215) and patients for whom the impact of intravitreal treatment was completely deferred (Group Stop, ?S; n = 179). Functional and anatomical parameters were collected at four time points before and after the lockdown. RESULTS: In Group C, the visual acuity at baseline and after the lockdown did not differ significantly. In Group S, the visual acuity deteriorated significantly compared with baseline and then improved slightly after the resumption of treatment, but it did not recover to baseline values. The mean central subfield thickness remained stable in Group C, whereas it increased in Group S and then returned to prelockdown values after the resumption of treatment.

In this retrospective study, we compared the efficacy of both treatments in 154 patients with very early-stage HCCs who underwent resection or RFA as initial therapy and were followed up for a median of 56.8 months. Propensity score matching analysis was also conducted. Overall survival was comparable between treatment groups (median survival time of 143 vs 97 months for resection and RFA, respectively; P = .132). Resection group; however, demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate after initial therapy than RFA group (42.3% vs 65.7%; P = .006) with a longer median recurrence-free survival time (66.7 vs 33.8 months; P = .002), which was confirmed even after matching (P = .04). In contrast, the recurrence pattern in advanced-stage (9.6% vs 1.0%; P = .01) or incurable recurrences (19% vs 13%; P = .04) was more frequent following resection than RFA. Recurrent lesions were comparatively more curable in RFA group than in resection group (80% vs 54.5%; P = .02). The recurrence of HCC was independently associated with lower serum albumin level (P = .027), the presence of comorbid diabetes mellitus (P = .010), and RFA (P = .034). In conclusion, in patients with very early-stage HCC, surgical resection has achieved significantly better recurrence-free survival than RFA.

In recent years, FDO2 prediction formulas have been proposed. However, they do not take into account the effect of inspiratory flow (V?I) on the FDO2 . The aim of this study was to validate a new FDO2 prediction formula, which takes into account the V?I and compares it with other FDO2 prediction formulas. METHODS During a bench study, spontaneous breathing was generated with a mechanical test lung connected to a mechanical ventilator set to volume control mode. O2 flow from a wall-mounted tube was delivered through a heat-and-moisture exchanger filter. A flow sensor recorded each breath of the V?I in ambient temperature and barometric pressure conditions. Three parameters [O2 flow at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 L/min; minute ventilation at 5, 10, 15, 20 L/min; and ratio of the inspiratory time (TI) to the total breathing cycle time (Ttot) (TI/Ttot) of 0.33 (TI/Ttot value) and 0.50 (TI/Ttot value)] were modified to generate many ventilatory patterns. An O2 analyzer continuously examined the FDO2 . RESULTS When the O2 flow and/or TI/Ttot increased, the FDO2 increased. When the minute ventilation increased, the FDO2 decreased. The results of the Bland-Altman method for the FDO2 , calculated by using our mathematical model and the measured FDO2 , showed that the mean  SD bias value was equal to 1.49  0.84%, and the limits of agreement ranged from -0.17% to 3.14%. The intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.991 for TI/Ttot = 0.33 and 0.994 for TI/Ttot = 0.50, and the coefficient of variation was 2.1% for TI/Ttot = 0.33 and 1.3% for TI/Ttot = 0.50. The results of the Bland-Altman method for the FDO2 calculated by using the Shapiro formula and the FDO2 measured on the bench indicated that the bias value was 0.075  8.66% and the limits of agreement ranged from -16.89% to 17.04%. For the Vincent formula, the bias value was 3.08%  8.56% and the limits of agreement ranged from -13.69% to 19.84%. CONCLUSIONS The V?I has a major impact on FDO2 during O2 therapy at low flow. FDO2 comparisons between frequently used prediction formulas and FDO2 measured on the bench indicated greater differences. Uncritical use of these formulas should be used cautiously to predict FDO2 . In this study, our prediction formula indicated a good accuracy for predicting FDO2 during supplemental oxygenation through a heat-and-moisture exchanger in patients who breathe spontaneously.","output":"A New Formula for Predicting the Fraction of Delivered Oxygen During Low-Flow Oxygen Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has raised an important question of whether government efforts (GEFs), especially communication work, could prevent the outbreak of this pandemic by enhancing public trust and public compliance with the government. This research answers this question by focusing on the case of Vietnam, a low-resource country that gained some achievements during the first pandemic year 2020. In particular, this study aims to investigate the relationship between GEF, public trust and public compliance during the countrys first nationwide social distancing. Design/methodology/approach: The structural equation modelling is used to analyse data collected from 467 respondents in Vietnam during the nationwide social distancing in 2020. Findings: Perceived GEF is positively associated with public compliance with the government directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust in government (PTG). The empirical results also reveal the effectiveness of government communication work, one among the governments great efforts, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of intensity and diversity in communication and information channels. Practical implications: During a pandemic, the governments must enhance public compliance with public health measures to implement the anti-epidemic missions effectively. Therefore, it is important to raise public perception of GEF and PTG. The studys findings highlight that governments in developing countries should implement relevant responses and policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises, especially in the context that effective vaccines are unavailable or insufficient. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this research is among the first attempts that examine the role of GEF, especially public health communication work, in raising public compliance directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust. The study carries some important messages for containing a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Do government activities increase public compliance in the Covid-19 pandemic?

However, studies have reported inconsistent findings about circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic versus normotensive pregnancies. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies at 2 time points: before, and at the time of preeclampsia diagnosis. PubMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to include all published studies examining circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. Differences in IL-10 levels were evaluated by standardized mean differences. Of 876 abstracts screened, 56 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Circulating IL-10 levels were not different before the time of active disease (standardized mean differences, -0.01 [95% CI, -0.11 to 0.08]; P=0.76). At the time of active disease, women with preeclampsia (n=1599) had significantly lower IL-10 levels compared with normotensive controls (n=1998; standardized mean differences, -0.79 [95% CI, -1.22 to -0.35]; P=0.0004). IL-10 levels were lower in both early/severe and late/mild forms of preeclampsia. Subgroup analysis revealed that IL-10 measurement methodology (ELISA or multiplex bead array) and the sample type (plasma or serum) significantly influenced the observed differences, with the use of sera paired with ELISA technology providing the best distinction in IL-10 levels between preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. These findings support the role of decreased IL-10 levels in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown period in a public-funded medical institute of India. Online feedback was obtained 3 weeks after the beginning of emergency remote teaching. The responses by the students and teachers shaped the final online teaching program which reinforced the perceived strengths and addressed the weaknesses. Observations were made for the proportion of scheduled lectures delivered through digital platform and students' attendance in the 1st week and last week of the study period. RESULTS: Feedback was obtained from 367 students and 56 teachers. Around three-fourths of the students (76.7%) and teachers (73.2%) were satisfied with online teaching. The themes generated for benefits of online teaching were similar for both students and teachers, but the perceived challenges differed.

Compared with COVID (?) patients, COVID (+) patients were older, more Hispanic and more likely to have type 2 diabetes (T2D, 73% vs 48%, p < .01). COVID(+) patients had a higher mean pH (7.25  0.10 vs 7.16  0.16, p < .01) and lower anion gap (18.7  5.7 vs 22.7  6.9, p = .01) than COVID (?) patients. COVID (+) patients were given less intravenous fluids in the first 24 h (2.8  1.9 vs 4.2  2.4 L, p = .01) and were more likely to receive glucocorticoids (95% vs. 11%, p < .01). COVID (+) patients may have taken longer to resolve their hyperglycaemic crisis (53.3  64.8 vs 28.8  27.5 h, p = .09) and may have experienced more hypoglycaemia <3.9 mmol/L (35% vs 19%, p = .09). COVID (+) patients had a higher length of hospital stay (LOS, 14.8  14.9 vs 6.5  6.0 days, p = .01) and in-hospital mortality (27% vs 7%, p = .02). DISCUSSION: Compared with COVID (?) patients, COVID (+) patients with DKA/HHS are more likely to have T2D. Despite less severe metabolic acidosis, COVID (+) patients may require more time to resolve the hyperglycaemic crisis and experience more hypoglycaemia while suffering greater LOS and risk of mortality. Larger studies are needed to examine whether differences in management between COVID (+) and (?) patients affect outcomes with DKA/HHS.","output":"Some characteristics of hyperglycaemic crisis differ between patients with and without COVID-19 at a safety-net hospital in a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid global spread of the new coronavirus and risk of pneumonia from COVID-19 infection, wearing a mask has become an essential defense for all frontline doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Plus, the rise in demand for masks from the general public means the worldwide supply of masks is insufficient, which has led to an increase in the reuse of disposable masks. Therefore, this study compared the impact of autoclaving (steaming) and 70% ethyl alcohol treatment for decontaminating masks, as both methods can easily be used at home. The autoclaved masks showed a better filtration efficiency than the 70% ethyl alcohol-treated masks.

Currently, the therapeutic approaches for OA are very limited in clinical. The extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from different mesenchymal stem cells displayed a prominent therapeutic effect on OA. But most EVs have limited resources and the risks of host rejection, immunological response, and etc. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) hold the advantages of easy availability, minimal immune rejection, and excellent immunomodulatory effects, although hUCMSCs-EVs have seldom been applied in OA. Herein, we investigated the potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of hUCMSCs-EVs on the treatment of OA. In our results, the treatment of hUCMSCs-EVs promoted the polarization of M2-type macrophages and the expression of anti-inflammation-related cytokines (IL-10). Notably, the supernate of M2 macrophages induced by hUCMSCs-EVs inhibited the level of inflammation-associated factors in OA chondrocytes caused by IL-1. Further, injection of hUCMSCs-EVs in the articular lumen ameliorated progression of OA and exerted chondroprotective potential based on the OA joint model created by the surgical transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT). In addition, we found five highly enriched miRNAs in hUCMSCs-EVs, including has-miR-122-5p, has-miR-148a-3p, has-miR-486-5p, has-miR-let-7a-5p, and has-miR-100-5p by High-throughput sequencing of miRNAs, with targeted genes mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we also detected the protein abundance of hUCMSCs-EVs using liquidation chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LCCMS/MS) analysis. Thus, our study indicates that hUCMSCs-EVs can alleviate cartilage degradation during the OA progression, mechanically may through delivering key proteins and modulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway mediated by miRNAs to promote polarization of M2 macrophage, exhibiting potent immunomodulatory potential. The current findings suggest that hUCMSCs-EVs might serve as a new reagent for the therapy of OA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, sixty patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and a chest CT exam on admission were enrolled. Based on a total severity score (range 0C20), patients were divided into two groups: ordinary group (total severity score < 7) and severe/critical group (total severity score > 7). Clinical results and EAT volume were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The severe/critical patients, compared to the ordinary ones, were older (66.83  11.72 vs 58.57  16.86 years; p = 0.031), had higher body mass index (27.77  2.11 vs 25.07  2.80 kg/m(2); p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of comorbidities. EAT volume was higher in severe/critical group, compared with the ordinary group (151.40  66.22 cm(3) vs 92.35  44.46 cm(3), p < 0.001). In severe/critical group, 19 (73%) patients were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), compared with 6 (20%) patients in the ordinary group (p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is equal to 0.781 (p < 0.001) (95% CI: 0.662C0.900). The cut-off found, in correspondence with the highest value of the Youden Index, is 97 cm(3): the sensitivity is equal to 83.3%, while the specificity is equal to 70% for predicting a worse outcome. The risk (odds ratio) of belonging to the severe/critical group in this population due to EAT  97 cm(3) is 11.667 (95% CI: 3.384C40.220; p < 0.001).

To fabricate robust and reproducible immunosensors with high sensitivity, the covalent immobilization of immunoglobulins (IgGs) in a site-specific manner contributes to better performance. Instead of the random IgG orientations result from the direct yet non-selective immobilization techniques, this review for the first time introduces the advances of stepwise yet site-selective conjugation strategies to give better biosensing efficiency. Noncovalently adsorbing IgGs is the first but decisive step to interact specifically with the Fc fragment, then following covalent conjugate can fix this uniform and antigens-favorable orientation irreversibly. In this review, we first categorized this stepwise strategy into two parts based on the different noncovalent interactions, namely adhesive layer-mediated interaction onto homofunctional support and layer-free interaction onto heterofunctional support (which displays several different functionalities on its surface that are capable to interact with IgGs). Further, the influence of ligands characteristics (synthesis strategies, spacer requirements and matrices selection) on the heterofunctional support has also been discussed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives for the real-world application of stepwise covalent conjugation are discussed. This review provides more insights into the fabrication of high-efficiency immunosensor, and special attention has been devoted to the well-orientation of full-length IgGs onto the sensing platform.","output":"Oriented immobilization of antibodies onto sensing platforms - A critical review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work are presented recommendations on the care of newborns who are children of mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba, and are expressed the general guidelines on the organization of the services for patients care, the main aspects related with the care in the birth moment, feeding related aspects, clinical characteristics described in this stage of life, complementary studies that must be conducted for diagnosis, the treatment to be used, and discharge and follow up criteria The autors collected poor existent scientific evidence on the infection by coronavirus in the neonatal stage, and jointly with the National Group of Neonatology of the Ministry of Public Health are proposing these recommendations which are adapted to the characteristics of the neonatal care in Cuba with the aim of guiding the behaviours to implement in the attention to newborns suspected or with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 These recommendations are based in the available scientific publications and they are subject to changes since this is an emerging infection and there is scarse information of its presence in the earliest stages of life like it can be a confirmed case of just 36 hours of life It is expected that all the personnel involved in the attention of newborns suspected or confirmed with infection by SARS-Cov-2 can analyze and add these recommendations to the care and surveillance of their patients ? 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas All rights reserved","output":"Recommendations for the care of newborns suspected or confirmed of infection by sars-cov-2 in Cuba"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The frequency of laparoscopic approaches increased in hernia surgery over the past years. After mesh placement in IPOM position, the real extent of the meshes configurational changes after termination of pneumoperitoneum is still largely unknown. To prevent a later mesh folding it might be useful to place the mesh while it is kept under tension. Conventionally used meshes may lose their Effective Porosity under these conditions due to poor elastic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate a newly developed elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) containing mesh that retains its Effective Porosity under mechanical strain in IPOM position in a porcine model. It was visualized under pneumoperitoneum using MRI in comparison to polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) meshes with similar structure. METHODS In each of ten minipigs, a mesh (TPU containing or native PVDF, 10  20 cm) was randomly placed in IPOM position at the center of the abdominal wall. After 8 weeks, six pigs underwent MRI evaluation with and without pneumoperitoneum to assess the visibility and elasticity of the mesh. Finally, pigs were euthanized and abdominal walls were explanted for histological and immunohistochemical assessment. The degree of adhesion formation was documented. RESULTS Laparoscopic implantation of elastic TPU meshes in IPOM position was feasible and safe in a minipig model. Mesh position could be precisely visualized and assessed with and without pneumoperitoneum using MRI after 8 weeks. Elastic TPU meshes showed a significantly higher surface increase under pneumoperitoneum in comparison to PVDF. Immunohistochemically, the amount of CD45-positive cells was significantly lower and the Collagen I/III ratio was significantly higher in TPU meshes after 8 weeks. There were no differences regarding adhesion formation between study groups. CONCLUSIONS The TPU mesh preserves its elastic properties in IPOM position in a porcine model after 8 weeks.

An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively).

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously and remotely, outside of hospital facilities, recognising early clinical deterioration. We aim to determine the feasibility & acceptability of remote monitoring systems for quarantined individuals in a hotel suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A pilot, proof-of-concept, feasibility trial was conducted in engineered hotels near London airports (May-June 2020). Individuals arriving to London with mild suspected COVID-19 symptoms requiring quarantine, as recommended by Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms unable to isolate at home were eligible. The SensiumVitals&#8482; patch, measuring temperature, heart & respiratory rates, was applied on arrival for the duration of their stay. Alerts were generated when pre-established thresholds were breeched; trained nursing staff could consequently intervene. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (M = 7, F = 7) were recruited; the mean age was 34.9 (SD 11) years. Mean length of stay was 3 (SD 1.8) days. In total, 10 vital alerts were generated across 4 participants, resulting in telephone contact, reassurance, or adjustment of the sensor. No individuals required hospitalisation or virtual general practitioner review. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Benefits included reduced viral exposure to healthcare staff, with recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor.

The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing RRT in Scotland. Methods Study design was an observational cohort study. Data were linked between the Scottish Renal Registry, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group national data sets using a unique patient identifier (Community Health Index (CHI)) for each individual by the Public Health and Intelligence unit of Public Health, Scotland. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. Results During the period 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020, 110 patients receiving RRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 amounting to 2% of the prevalent RRT population. Of those affected, 87 were receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. Patients who tested positive were older and more likely to reside in more deprived postcodes. Mortality was high at 26.7% in the dialysis patients and 29.2% in the transplant patients. There was consistency between Scottish renal units of the measures implemented to prevent or reduce transmission but timing varied. Conclusion The rate of detected SARS-CoV-2 in people receiving RRT in Scotland was relatively low but with a high mortality for those demonstrating infection. Although impossible to confirm, it appears that the measures taken within dialysis units coupled with the national shielding policy, have been effective in protecting this population from infection.","output":"COVID-19 in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy in Scotland: findings and experience from the Scottish Renal Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to explore the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on exports of goods and services, logistics performance, environmental management system (ISO 14001) certification and quality management system (ISO 9001) certification in top affected Asian countries of India, Iran, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Findings: Results indicate that the severity of COVID-19 shows a strong negative association and influence of COVID-19 on the exportation of goods and services, logistics performance, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications in all the six highly affected countries during a pandemic outbreak. Although the adverse effects of COVID-19 in exporting countries persisted until December 31, 2020, their magnitude decreased over time in Indonesia and Pakistan. During the COVID-19 outbreak, Pakistan showed comparatively better performance among the six top highly affected Asian countries due to its smart locked down strategy and prevents its economy from severe damages. While India and Iran export drastically go down due to a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Research limitations/implications: The research findings produce much-required policy suggestions for leaders, world agencies and governments to take corrective measures on an emergent basis to prevent the economies from more damages and improve their logistics, environmental and quality performance during the pandemic of COVID-19. Originality/value: This study develops a framework and investigates the intensifying effects of COVID-19 effects on economic growth, logistics performance, environmental performance and quality production processes. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Intensifying effects of COVID-19 on economic growth, logistics performance, environmental sustainability and quality management: evidence from Asian countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equine lentivirus receptor 1 (ELR1) has been identified as the sole receptor for equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. In addition to the previously described membrane-associated form of ELR1, two other major alternative splicing variant mRNAs were identified in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). One major spliced species (ELR1-IN) contained an insertion of 153 nt, which resulted in a premature stop codon situated 561 nt upstream of the predicted membrane spanning domain. The other major species (ELR1-DE) has a deletion of 109 nt that causes a shift of the open reading frame and generates a stop codon 312 nt downstream. Because ELR1-DE presumably encodes a peptide of a mere 23 residues, only ELR1-IN was further analyzed. The expression of a soluble form of ELR1 (sELR1) by ELR1-IN was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Similar to ELR1, the transcription level of ELR1-IN varied among individual horses and at different time points in the same individuals. The ratio of ELR1-IN mRNA species to ELR1 mRNA was approximately 12.5. Pre-incubation of the recombinant sELR1 with EIAV significantly inhibited EIAV infection in equine macrophages, the primary in vivo target cell of the virus. Fetal equine dermal (FED) cells are susceptible to EIAV in vitro, and the replication of EIAV in FED cells transiently transfected with ELR1-IN was markedly reduced when compared with replication in cells transfected with the empty vector. Finally, the expression levels of both forms of the EIAV receptor were significantly regulated by infection with this virus. Taken together, our data indicate that sELR1 acts as a secreted cellular factor that inhibits EIAV infection in host cells.","output":"The Soluble Form of the EIAV Receptor Encoded by an Alternative Splicing Variant Inhibits EIAV Infection of Target Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2020, several vaccines have become available as part of the global efforts to contain the adverse health outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

To study the current prevalence of depressive symptoms in Russian non-clinical population we conducted screening using an online survey based on Depression subscale of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). Methods: The online survey covered 2610 Russian-speaking respondents and included HADS-D, questions about sex, age and presence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) diagnoses or symptoms in respondents. Results: The proportion of respondents with depressive symptoms, estimated by online HADS-D, was 14.4% (11.5% - at subclinical level, 2.9% - at clinical level). The overall HADS-D score was higher in women (p=0.003), in young individuals under 30 y.o vs. participants over 42 y.o. (p=0.004) and in individuals with self-reported CVD symptoms (p=0.00002). Linear regression analysis showed that self-reported CVD symptoms increase HADS-D score (p<0.001), but male sex (p=0.002) and older age (p<0.001) decrease it. Logistic regression showed that CVD symptoms increase the risk of depressive symptoms by HADS-D (p=0.033, OR=1.29), but older age (p=0.015, OR=0.87) and male sex (as a trend, p=0.052, OR=0.80) decrease this risk.

Antigen-specific controlled immunization of experimental animals may elicit antibody repertoires that significantly differ from those generated in the context of the immune response mounted in the course of disease. Accordingly, rabbits were immunized by several recombinant antigens representing distinct domains of the viral spike protein and monoclonal antibodies were isolated from single cells obtained by cell sorting. Characterization of a panel of successfully isolated anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies demonstrated that they exhibit high specificity and affinity profiles. Anti-RBD antibodies revealing significant neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro were found to target at least three distinct epitopes. Epitope mapping established that two of these antibodies recognized a novel epitope located on the surface of the RBD.

Radiological imaging plays a prominent role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pneumonia. This paper reviews recent innovations in the radiologic diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections. RECENT FINDINGS Chest radiography is the most commonly used imaging tool in pneumonias because of availability and an excellent cost-benefit ratio. Computed tomography is mandatory in unresolved cases or when complications of pneumonia are suspected. A specific radiologic pattern can suggest a diagnosis in many cases. Bacterial pneumonias are classified into four main groups: community-acquired, aspiration, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The radiographic patterns of community-acquired pneumonia may be variable and are often related to the causative agent. Aspiration pneumonia involves the lower lobes with bilateral multicentric opacities. The radiographic patterns of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia are variable, most commonly showing diffuse multifocal involvement and pleural effusion. SUMMARY Combination of pattern recognition with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to the radiologic interpretation of pneumonia. Radiological imaging will narrow the differential diagnosis of direct additional diagnostic measures and serve as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations.","output":"Radiological imaging in pneumonia: recent innovations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 infection adversely affects the cardiovascular system.

A contributor to this disparity may relate to the disproportionate burden of cancer treatment-related cardiovascular (CV) toxicities. The objective of this review is to identify studies that report racial differences in CV toxicity risk. METHODS Medline and Embase were searched for studies that assessed CV toxicities as the outcome(s) and included Black and White women with breast cancer. Studies were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and through the use of multiple reviewers. RESULTS The review included 13 studies following a review of 409 citations and 49 full-text articles. All studies were retrospective and 8/13 utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Trastuzumab was the most frequently studied treatment. The proportion of Black women in these studies ranged from 5.5 to 63%. A majority of studies reported a higher risk of CV toxicity amongst Black women when compared to white women (93%). Black women had up to a two times higher risk of CV toxicity (HR, 2.73 (CI, 1.24 to 6.01)) compared to white women. Only one study evaluated the role of socioeconomic factors in explaining racial differences in CV toxicity; however, the disparity remained even after adjusting for these factors. CONCLUSIONS There is a critical need for more longitudinal studies that evaluate multilevel factors (e.g., psychosocial, biological) that may help to explain this disparity.

The disease COVID-19 is now spread worldwide and has tremendous socio-economic consequences. The origin of the virus can be reconstructed through epidemiological studies and, even more so, from genome comparisons. How the evolution of the virus and the transition to humans might have happened is the subject of much speculation. It is considered certain that the virus is of animal origin and very likely passed from bats to humans in a zoonotic event.

The propagation of SARS-like bat viruses in cell culture allowed experiments aimed at increasing the infectivity of the virus and adaptation to human cells. This article summarizes the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 and focusses on a specific sequence encoding the spike protein.

We developed a stochastic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a 100-bed nursing home with a staff of 99 healthcare personnel (HCP) in a community of 20,000 people.

The model also included: importation of COVID-19 from the community, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 positive residents, facility-wide adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) use by HCP, and testing. We systematically varied coverage of mRNA vaccine among residents, HCP, and the community. Simulations were run for 6 months after the second dose in the facility, with results summarized over 1,000 simulations. Expected resident cases decreased as community vaccination increased, with large reductions at high HCP coverage. The probability of a COVID-19 outbreak was lower as well: at HCP vaccination coverage of 60%, probability of an outbreak was below 20% for community coverage of 50% or above. At high coverage, stopping asymptomatic screening and facility-wide testing yielded similar results. Results suggest that high coverage among HCP and in the community can prevent infections in residents. When vaccination is high in nursing homes, but not in their surrounding communities, asymptomatic and facility-wide testing remains necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Measurements of CO(2) production with oxygen consumption yield important indices such as the respiratory quotient and estimates of energy expenditure, which may be used for further investigation in the various fields of metabolism, obesity, sleep disorders, and lifestyle-related issues. Measures of PaCO(2) are nowadays performed using the Severinghaus electrode in arterial blood or in arterialized capillary blood, while the same electrode system has been modified to enable relatively accurate non-invasive monitoring of the transcutaneous partial pressure of CO(2) (PtcCO(2)). PtcCO(2) monitoring during sleep can be helpful for evaluating sleep apnea syndrome, particularly in children. End-tidal PCO(2) is inferior to PtcCO(2) as far as accuracy, but it provides breath-by-breath estimates of respiratory gas exchange, while PtcCO(2) reflects temporal trends in alveolar ventilation. The frequency of monitoring end-tidal PCO(2) has markedly increased in light of its multiple applications (e.g., verify endotracheal intubation, anesthesia or mechanical ventilation, exercise testing, respiratory patterning during sleep, etc.).","output":"Recent Insights into the Measurement of Carbon Dioxide Concentrations for Clinical Practice in Respiratory Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, people volunteered for sewing hand-made face masks.

Specifically, acute stroke patients, with pre-existing diabetes, pose a clinical challenge. It is established that diabetes is associated with a worse prognosis after acute stroke and the various biological factors that mediate poor recovery profiles in diabetic patients is unknown. The level of association and impact of diabetes, in the setting of reperfusion therapy, is yet to be determined. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of the role of diabetes in stroke, therapeutic strategies for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and/or stroke in diabetes, and various therapeutic considerations that may apply during pre-stroke, acute, sub-acute and post-stroke stages. The early diagnosis of diabetes as a comorbidity for stroke, as well as tailored post-stroke management of diabetes, is pivotal to our efforts to limit the burden. Increasing awareness and involvement of neurologists in the management of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors is desirable towards improving stroke prevention and efficacy of reperfusion therapy in acute stroke patients with diabetes.

These distributions are manifested through some stochastic mechanisms. This chapter divides a typical outbreak in a closed population into two phases, the initial phase and beyond the initial phase. For the initial phase, this chapter addresses several aspects: the invasion (i.e. the risk of a large outbreak); quantities associated with a small outbreak; and characteristics of a large outbreak. In a large outbreak beyond the initial phase, the focus is on its final size. After a review of distribution theories and stochastic processes, this chapter separately addresses each of these issues by asking questions such as: Are the latent period and/or the infectious period distributions playing any role? What is the role of the contact process for this issue? Is the basic reproduction number R (0) sufficient to address this issue? How many stochastic mechanisms may manifest observations that may resemble a power-law distribution, and how much detail is really needed to address this specific issue? etc. This chapter uses distribution theory and stochastic processes to capture the agentChostCenvironment interface during an outbreak of an infectious disease. With different phases of an outbreak and special issues in mind, modellers need to choose which detailed aspects of the distributions and the stochastic mechanisms need to be included, and which detailed aspects need to be ignored.

This analysis sought to evaluate the timing at which mass testing took place in relation to the known presence of a COVID-19 infection and the resulting number of infections that occurred. In 15 LTCFs that performed facility-wide testing in response to an identified case, high prevalences of additional cases in residents and staff members were found at initial testing (28.0% and 7.4%, respectively), suggesting spread of infection had already occurred by the time the first case was identified. Prevalence was also high during follow-up, with a total of 42.4% of residents and 11.8% of staff members infected overall in the response facilities. In comparison, 13 LTCFs conducted testing as a preventive strategy before a case was identified. Although the majority of these LTCFs identified at least one COVID-19 case, the prevalence was significantly lower at initial testing in both residents and staff members (0.5% and 1.0%, respectively) and overall after follow-up (1.5% and 1.7%, respectively).

The main question is how Israeli sex workers perceive the public debate over governing the Israeli sex industry. Methods: This study combines qualitative methods that include ethnographic observations and interviews. The ethnographic observations were carried out between November 2018 and October 2019 in gatherings, protests, and academic conferences where sex workers were the lead speakers. In addition, 16 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with sex workers across various indoor sectors, and four interviews were conducted with political figures to learn about their efforts to adopt neo-abolitionist legislation. Results: the Israeli legislative proceedings initiated in 2007 deny sex workers a voice and exclude them from the political space and policy debates that have a direct bearing on their working lives and wellbeing. Thus, Israeli sex workers perceive sex work governance as controlling their agency and deepening their stigmatization. In this process, we show how contrasting groups became strange bedfellows in their attempt to protect sex workers by incriminating clients of the sex industry. Conclusions: We conclude that the binary framings of debates about sex work in Israel do not address the actual needs or political desires of sex workers who are ignored and excluded from the discourse about them.

Methods: : A prospective open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in front-line medical staff from the general hospital Enrique Cabrera in Mxico City. One hundred and seventy volunteers were enrolled and equally divided in control group and SES group. All members of the trial wore the adequate personal protection equipment at all times while performing their duties, as required by standard COVID-19 safety protocols. Additionally, the SES group participants followed a prophylactic protocol with SES (oral and nasal rinses, three times a day for 4 weeks). All participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and disease in a time-frame of 4 weeks and the incidence of illness per group was registered. The relative risk of disease, associated with each treatment was calculated. Results: : The presence of COVID-19 positive cases, in the group that received the nasal and oral rinses with SES was 1.2%, while in the group that did not do the SES rinses (control group), it was 12.7% (p= 0.0039 and RR= 0.09405;95%, CI of 0.01231-0.7183).

However, it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other. In this report, a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA, termed mRNA5C1, was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader-body fusion site of the mRNA is located at approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the consensus IG sequence for mRNA 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known IG consensus sequences. To determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter, we cloned a 140-nt sequence (from 70 nt upstream to 70 nt downstream of the fusion site) from viral genomic RNA and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Transfection of the reporter RNA into MHV-infected cells resulted in synthesis of a CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The strength of this promoter was similar to that of the IG7 (for mRNA 7) as measured by the CAT activity. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mRNA transcription, while mutations within the 13-nt abolished mRNA transcription. In vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope (E) protein was translated from mRNA5C1, which encodes the open reading frame (ORF) 5b at its 5-end, indicating that mRNA5C1 is a functional message. Furthermore, when the ORF5b was replaced with the CAT gene and placed in the DI in the context of viral mini-genome, CAT was expressed not only from the first ORF of mRNA5C1 but also from the second and third ORF of mRNA5 and genomic DI RNA, respectively, suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of ORF5b expression. Our findings thus support the notion that base-pairing between the leader (or antileader) and the IG is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic RNA transcription.","output":"Identification of a Noncanonical Signal for Transcription of a Novel Subgenomic mRNA of Mouse Hepatitis Virus: Implication for the Mechanism of Coronavirus RNA Transcription"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Construction noise is an integral part of urban social noise.

The noise conditions within the site in different spatial areas and temporal stages was analyzed. Binaural recording of 10 typical construction noises, including earthwork machinery, concrete machinery, and hand-held machinery, were performed. The physical acoustics and psychoacoustic characteristics were analyzed with the aid of a sound quality analysis software.

This research showed that the noise situation on construction sites is not optimistic, and the construction workers have been affected to varying degrees in terms of psychological experience, hearing ability, and on-site communications.

Protecting healthcare workers exposed to toxic or infectious substances via inhalation, ingestion, or skin and mucous membrane penetration necessitates the use of proper facial protection. Exposure to chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) risks imposes the use of filtering respirators: a face mask with broad spectrum cartridges or a hood with a blower connected to cartridges. Broad spectrum cartridges provide level 3 particle filtration for R and B risks. The COVID-19 crisis has led to much discussion about the role and use of masks to protect healthcare workers from inhaling airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus particles: wearing face masks with or without visors and goggles. Two types of masks are most commonly used in healthcare settings: FFP2 respirators and the so called surgical masks. The latter provides barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. Most surgical masks do not effectively filter small airborne particles (5 < m) and do not prevent leakage around the mask. However, and depending on the type of care, healthcare professionals must have their masks tightly covering the face with a level of filtration that protects the user from exposure to aerosols, i.e. use FFP2 and FFP3. Strict testing procedures should evaluate this professional equipment. The current pandemic is leading us to question the best practices and the right protection materials to put in place.

Molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 emerged shortly after the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, however, serological tests based on antiviral antibody detection, revealing previous exposure to the virus, required longer developmental phases, due to the need for correctly folded and glycosylated antigens. The delay between the identification of a new virus and the development of reliable serodiagnostic tools limits our readiness for the control of a future epidemic. In this context, we propose the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae as an easy-to-handle micro-factory for the rapid production of viral antigens, to be used at the forefront of emerging epidemics. As a study model, we engineered L. tarentolae to express the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and report the ability of the purified RBD antigen to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to that of a reference antigen produced in human cells. This is the first application of an antigen produced in L. tarentolae for the serodiagnosis of a Coronaviridae infection.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic pain in MHD patients and examine the factors associated with QOL. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted between October 2020 and April 2021, 1204 MHD patients from nine hemodialysis units were screened for chronic pain in Chengdu, China, and 296 MHD patients with chronic pain were enrolled in this study. We analyzed data on clinicodemographic characteristics, pain interference and severity (Brief Pain Inventory), QOL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey - mental component summary [MCS] and physical component summary [PCS]), pain self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), and social support (Social Support Rating Scale). Results: The prevalence of chronic pain in MHD patients was 26.74% in this study. The most common areas of pain were lower back (63.5%), lower limbs (55.0%), and head (33.5%), 36.5% did not implement any measures to relieve it. Of the patients who did receive pain treatment or medication, 56.9% reported that the measures they took had less than half of the pain relief. MHD patients with chronic pain had poor QOL based on scores on the MCS (53  16.76) and PCS (40.56  13.81). Stepwise multiple regression identified age, financial strain, pain interference, social support, and pain self-efficacy as independent predictors of QOL. Pain self-efficacy was significantly associated with social support (r = 0.5, p < 0.01), MCS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01), and PCS (r = 0.8, p < 0.01). The mediating effects of pain self-efficacy were 70.31% on the relationship between social support and MCS, and 75.62% on the relationship between social support and PCS. Conclusion: Chronic pain is prevalent and undermanaged in Chinese MHD patients, resulting in worse QOL. Healthcare providers should focus on pain management and the impact of psychosocial factors on patient QOL.

The trial had 58% uptake at recruitment, and retention was 86% at age 2 years, 77% at age 3.5 years, and 69% at age 5 years. Children who received the brief sleep intervention in infancy had just half the risk of obesity at 2 years of age compared to those who did not receive the sleep intervention. Importantly, this substantially reduced risk was still apparent at our follow-up at 5 years of age. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this follow-up at age 11 years is to determine whether differences in BMI z-score and obesity risk remain apparent now that it is at least 9 years since cessation of the sleep intervention. Several secondary outcomes of interest will also be examined including 24-hour movement patterns, mental health and wellbeing, and use of electronic media, particularly prior to sleep. METHODS: We will seek renewed consent from all 734 of the original 802 POI families who expressed interest in further involvement. Children and parent(s) will attend 2 clinics and 1 home appointment to obtain measures of anthropometry and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan), 24-hour movement patterns (sleep, sedentary time, and physical activity measured using an AX3 accelerometer), mental health and wellbeing (validated questionnaires), family functioning (validated questionnaires), use of electronic media (wearable and stationary cameras, questionnaires), and diet and eating behaviors (24-hour recall, questionnaires). RESULTS: This follow-up study has full ethical approval from the University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (H19/109) and was funded in May 2019 by the Health Research Council of New Zealand (grant 19/346). Data collection commenced in June 2020, and first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes of early obesity intervention are rare. Despite the growing body of evidence linking insufficient sleep with an increased risk of obesity in children, interventions targeting improvements in sleep have been insufficiently explored. Our initial follow-up at 5 years of age suggested that an early sleep intervention may have long-term benefits for effective weight management in children. Further analysis in our now preteen population will provide much-needed evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness of sleep interventions in infancy as an obesity prevention approach.

The discipline of epidemiology lays great emphasis on causation, while ML research does not. Some epidemiologists have proposed imposing what amounts to a causal constraint on ML in epidemiology, requiring it either to engage in causal inference or restrict itself to mere projection. We whittle down the issues to the question of whether causal knowledge is necessary for underwriting predictions about the outcomes of public health interventions. While there is great plausibility to the idea that it is, conviction that something is impossible does not by itself motivate a constraint to forbid trying. We disambiguate the possible motivations for such a constraint into definitional, metaphysical, epistemological, and pragmatic considerations and argue that Proceed with caution (rather than Stop!) is the outcome of each. We then argue that there are positive reasons to proceed, albeit cautiously. Causal inference enforces existing classification schema prior to the testing of associational claims (causal or otherwise), but associations and classification schema are more plausibly discovered (rather than tested or justified) in a back-and-forth process of gaining reflective equilibrium. ML instantiates this kind of process, we argue, and thus offers the welcome prospect of uncovering meaningful new concepts in epidemiology and public healthprovided it is not causally constrained.","output":"Can Robots Do Epidemiology?

Here, we investigated the relationship between hypertension prevalence and gut microbial composition in two cohorts. METHODS: We included 871 unrelated TwinsUK women with faecal microbiome data (16s rRNA gene sequencing). Multivariable linear models adjusted for age, age2 and BMI as well as MiRKAT models, were used to estimate the association of hypertension with alpha- and beta-diversity metrics. To identify taxa associated with hypertension, a generalized additive model for location scale and shape was computed adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Results were replicated in 448 women from PREDICT-1. RESULTS: We found that measures of alpha diversity are significantly lower in hypertensive cases [Beta(95% confidence interval, 95% CI)a=a-0.05 (-0.095 to -0.004), Pa=a0.03] and a significant association between beta diversity and hypertension (FDRa<a0.05). We identified and replicated two genera associated with hypertension. The genus, Ruminiclostridium 6 was less abundant in hypertension cases [meta-analysis (95% CI)a=a-0.31 (-0.5 to -0.13), Pa=a1aa10-3].

An inverse correlation was seen between maternal vitD status and infant plasma TNF concentration (r = ?0.27; p < 0.05). Infant whole blood was also subjected to in vitro antigenic stimulation. TNF, IFN, IL-4, IL-13, and TGF1 responses by infant leukocytes were significantly higher if mothers were vitD sufficient but were not as closely correlated to infants own vitD status. Conversely, IL-10 and IL-12 responses after antigenic challenge were more correlated to infant vitD status. These data are consistent with vitD-mediated changes in breast milk composition providing immunological signaling to breastfeeding infants and indicate differential physiological effects of direct-infant versus maternal vitD supplementation.

Russia has a dramatic effect on the development, economy, and migration of neighboring states with a weaker economy. In this regard, the research focuses on the study of key drivers, factors, and reasons affecting this imbalance in the context of the social strata of Kazakhstan.

In the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we examined the possible comorbidity between these two entities. OBJECTIVES APV is the second most common cause of vestibular disorders and results from a sudden and unilateral loss of vestibular inputs. The characteristic signs and symptoms include sudden and prolonged vertigo, absence of auditory symptoms, and absence of other neurological symptoms. An infective etiology of APV has long been hypothesized on the basis of its association with respiratory tract infections and its frequent occurrence in epidemics. Possible comorbidity with herpes simplex virus type 1 reactivation or influenza virus infection has also been proposed. This study was designed to assess the possible comorbidity between APV and COVID-19. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Quantification of the number of hospital admissions for APV over the period from February to May 2020 was carried out in 5 French hospitals. A comparison with 2018 and 2019 entries over the same period was made. Comorbidity between APV and COVID-19 infection was investigated. RESULTS No significant increase in admission for APV was noticed over the examination period. No significant difference was noticed among hospitals located in COVID-19 high- and low-risk zones for SARS-CoV-2. No significant increase in the severity of the APV cases was noticed.

Pre- and postfusion structures of viral fusion proteins have been characterized, but conformational changes between them remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the intermediate conformation of the murine coronavirus fusion protein, called the spike protein, which must be cleaved by a cellular protease following receptor binding. Western blot analysis of protease digestion products revealed that two subunits (67 and 69 kDa) are produced from a single spike protein (180 kDa). These two subunits were considered to be by-products derived from conformational changes and were useful for probing the intermediate conformation of the spike protein. Interaction with a heptad repeat (HR) peptide revealed that these subunits adopt packed and unpacked conformations, respectively, and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a trimeric assembly. Based on biochemical observations, we propose an asymmetric trimer model for the intermediate structure of the spike protein. Receptor binding induces the membrane-binding potential of the trimer, in which at least one HR motif forms a packed-hairpin structure, while membrane fusion subunits are covered by the receptor-binding subunit, thereby preventing the spike protein from forming the typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure predicted by the current model of class I viral fusion protein. Subsequent proteolysis induces simultaneous packing of the remaining unpacked HRs upon assembly of three HRs at the central axis to generate a six-helix bundle. Our model proposes a key mechanism for membrane fusion of enveloped viruses. IMPORTANCE Recent studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) revealed the mechanism underlying activation of viral fusion protein at the priming stage. However, characterizing the subsequent triggering stage underpinning transition from pre- to postfusion structures is difficult because single-particle cryoEM excludes unstable structures that appear as heterogeneous shapes. Therefore, population-based biochemical analysis is needed to capture features of unstable proteins. Here, we analyzed protease digestion products of a coronavirus fusion protein during activation; their sizes appear to be affected directly by the conformational state. We propose a model for the viral fusion protein in the intermediate state, which involves a compact structure and conformational changes that overcome steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits.","output":"Biochemical Analysis of Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Conformational Intermediates during Membrane Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2002, ? coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019).

Out of the two isolates, one was found to harbor a mutation in its receptor-binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site, arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-? branched amino acid).

The dual principle, used for showing that an element is above the least fixpoint, is related to inductive invariants. In this paper we provide proof rules which are similar in spirit but for showing that an element is above the greatest fixpoint or, dually, below the least fixpoint. The theory is developed for non-expansive monotone functions on suitable lattices of the form [Formula: see text] , where Y is a finite set and [Formula: see text] an MV-algebra, and it is based on the construction of (finitary) approximations of the original functions.

Globalizationthe closer integration of the world economyhas facilitated pathogen spread among countries through the growth of trade and travel. High-risk areas for the emergence and spread of infectious disease are where these three trends intersect with predisposing socioecological conditions including the presence of wild disease reservoirs, agricultural practices that increase contact between wildlife and livestock, and cultural practices that increase contact between humans, wildlife, and livestock. Such an intersection occurs in China, which has been a cradle of zoonoses from the Black Death to avian influenza and SARS.

While vaccines are being globally deployed, variants of concern (VOCs) are emerging with the potential for vaccine escape. VOCs are characterized by a higher within-host transmissibility, and this may alter their susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Here we describe a model to understand the effect of changes in within-host reproduction number R(0), as proxy for transmissibility, of VOCs on the effectiveness of antiviral therapy with molnupiravir through modeling and simulation. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801 or MK 4482) is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug inhibiting viral replication through lethal mutagenesis, ultimately leading to viral extinction. We simulated 800 mg molnupiravir treatment every 12 h for 5 days, with treatment initiated at different time points before and after infection. Modeled viral mutations range from 1.25 to 2-fold greater transmissibility than wild type, but also include putative co-adapted variants with lower transmissibility (0.75-fold). Antiviral efficacy was correlated with R(0), making highly transmissible VOCs more sensitive to antiviral therapy. Total viral load was reduced by up to 70% in highly transmissible variants compared to 30% in wild type if treatment was started in the first 1C3 days post inoculation. Less transmissible variants appear less susceptible. Our findings suggest there may be a role for pre- or post-exposure prophylactic antiviral treatment in areas with presence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, clinical trials with borderline efficacious results should consider identifying VOCs and examine their impact in post-hoc analysis.","output":"Effectiveness of Antiviral Therapy in Highly-Transmissible Variants of SARS-CoV-2: A Modeling and Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a health emergency that needs to be addressed immediately.

The receptor targeted by SARS-CoV-2 is a supercomplex formed by a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1, in which ACE2 binds the viral protein and B0AT1 stabilizes the heterodimer.

Assessments of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have relied primarily on convenience sampling, which does not provide reliable estimates of community prevalence because of inherent biases. Methods: From August 2020 to February 2021, we conducted a serial stratified randomized samplings to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 3,717 participants, and weekly sampling of community wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Jefferson County, KY. With the use of a Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR)-type model, we obtained longitudinal estimates of prevalence and compared these with wastewater concentration, using regression analysis. Findings: Model analysis revealed significant temporal differences in epidemic peaks; the average incidence rate based on serological sampling in some areas was up to 50% higher than health department rates based on convenience sampling. The model-estimated average prevalence rates correlated well with wastewater (correlation=0.63). In regression analysis, a weekly unit increase in wastewater concentration of SARS-CoV-2 corresponded to an average increase of between 1-1.3 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100K residents. Interpretation: Publicly available health department incidence rates vastly underestimate true community incidence and wastewater has a high potential to provide robust estimates of community spread of infection.

COVID-19-related household economic stress and school closures will likely have adverse effects. We investigate the relationship among adolescent mental health, adult income loss, and household dynamics during the pandemic in Kenya. METHODS: A cross-sectional mobile phone-based survey was conducted with one adult and adolescent (age 10-19 years) pair from a sample of households identified through previous cohort studies in three urban Kenyan counties (Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisumu). Survey questions covered education, physical and mental health, and COVID-19-related impacts on job loss, food insecurity, and healthcare seeking. Logistic regression models were fit to explore relationships among adult income loss, household dynamics, food insecurity, and adult and adolescent depressive symptoms (defined as PHQ-2 score 2). RESULTS: A total of 2,224 adult-adolescent pairs (Nairobi, n = 814; Kilifi, n = 914; Kisumu, n = 496) completed the survey. Over a third (36%) of adolescents reported depressive symptoms, highest among older (15-19 years) boys. Adult loss of income was associated with skipping meals, depressive symptoms, household tensions/violence, and forgoing healthcare. Adolescents had 2.5 higher odds of depressive symptoms if COVID-19 was causing them to skip meals (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 2.0-3.1), if their adult head of household reported depressive symptoms (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 2.1-3.2). CONCLUSIONS: Income loss during the pandemic adversely affects food insecurity, household dynamics, healthcare-seeking behavior, and worsening adolescent depressive symptoms.

As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.","output":"NS5 of dengue virus mediates STAT2 binding and degradation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a severe challenge for healthcare workers, with a considerable impact on their mental health.

We designed an observational longitudinal study to systematically examine the psychological wellbeing of all employees in a large University Hospital in Italy, using validated psychometric scales in the context of the occupational physicians health surveillance, in collaboration with Psychiatric Unit. METHODS: The study started after ethical approval in August 2020. For each worker, the psychological wellbeing is screened in two steps. The first level questionnaire collects sociodemographic characteristics, personal and occupational COVID-19 exposure, worries and concerns about COVID-19, general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) and anxiety (GAD-7). Workers who score above the cut-off in at least one scale are further investigated by the second level questionnaire composed by PHQ-9, DES-II and SCL-90. If second level shows psychological impairments, we offer individual specialist treatment (third level). We plan to follow-up all subjects to monitor symptoms and possible chronicization; we aim to investigate potential risk factors through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: Preliminary results refer to a sample of 550 workers who completed the multi-step evaluation from August to December 2020, before vaccination campaign started. The participation rate was 90%. At first level screening, 39% of the subjects expressed general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), 22% post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R), and 21% symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7). Women, nurses, younger workers, subjects with COVID-19 working exposure and with an infected family member showed significantly higher psychological impairment compared to colleagues. After the second level screening, 12% and 7% of all workers showed, respectively, depressive and dissociative symptoms; scorings were significantly associated with gender and occupational role. We are currently extending sample size and evaluating subjects over a period of further 12 months.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of our study was to catalog how information, system function, and user interface were deployed across the COVID-19 state dashboards. Our secondary objective was to group and characterize the dashboards based on the information we collected using clustering analysis. METHODS: For preliminary data collection, we developed a framework to first analyze two dashboards as a group and reach agreement on coding. We subsequently doubled coded the remaining 48 dashboards using the framework and reviewed the coding to reach total consensus. RESULTS: All state dashboards included maps and graphs, most frequently line charts, bar charts, and histograms. The most represented metrics were total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalization. Decisions on how metrics were aggregated and stratified greatly varied across dashboards. Overall, the dashboards were very interactive with 96% having at least some functionality including tooltips, zooming, or exporting capabilities. For visual design and platform, we noted that the software was dominated by a few major organizations. Our cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution, and each cluster provided additional insights about how groups of states engaged in specific practices in dashboard design.

Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins including HIV, Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). In addition, we show inhibition of a non-enveloped adenovirus. Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).","output":"Ginkgolic acid inhibits fusion of enveloped viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is growing interest in the pathophysiological processes of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the potential role of leptin.

However, we did observe that BMI category was an effect modifier for the association between leptin and verbal memory (p for interaction = 0.03), where higher levels of leptin were associated with better performance among normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-24.9) kg/m2 (beta = 0.12, p = 0.02). No association was observed between leptin level and verbal memory test performance among participants who were overweight or obese. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the association between leptin and cognitive function is moderated by BMI category. Prospective examination of individuals transitioning from middle age to older adulthood will help to clarify the contribution of leptin to AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.","output":"Association Between Leptin, Cognition, and Structural Brain Measures Among \\"Early\\" Middle-Aged Adults: Results from the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When COVID-19 hit the UK in early 2020, there were no known treatments for a condition that results in the death of around one in four patients hospitalised with this disease. Around the world, possible treatments were administered to huge numbers of patients, without any reliable assessments of safety and efficacy. The rapid generation of high-quality evidence was vital. RECOVERY is a streamlined, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial, which was set up in response to this challenge. As of April 2021, over 39,000 patients have been enrolled from 178 hospital sites in the UK. Within 100 days of its initiation, RECOVERY demonstrated that dexamethasone improves survival for patients with severe disease;a result that was rapidly implemented in the UK and internationally saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Importantly, it also showed that other widely used treatments (such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) have no meaningful benefit for hospitalised patients. This was only possible through randomisation of large numbers of patients and the adoption of streamlined and pragmatic procedures focused on quality, together with widespread collaboration focused on a single goal. RECOVERY illustrates how clinical trials and healthcare can be integrated, even in a pandemic. This approach provides new opportunities to generate the evidence needed for high-quality healthcare not only for a pandemic but for the many other conditions that place a burden on patients and the healthcare system.","output":"Making trials part of good clinical care: lessons from the RECOVERY trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diet and physical activity might help to improve quality of life and maintain remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In other conditions, interventions in which diet and physical activity are combined seem to be more effective than separate interventions. Therefore, we assessed the effect of a combined lifestyle intervention on the impact of disease on daily life, clinical disease activity, fatigue and quality of life in patients with Crohns disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A single arm intervention study was performed in IBD patients in remission or with mildly active disease. Participants received personal advice to improve their diet and level of physical activity by a dietician and a physiotherapist in one face-to-face and one telephone consult. These advices were supported by guidelines based on the Dutch dietary and physical activity guidelines, a recipe app and a booklet with physical activity exercises. IBD disability index (IBD-DI) to assess impact of disease on daily life, clinical disease activity questionnaires (P-HBI or P-SCCAI), IBD fatigue (IBD-F) patient self-assessment scale and IBD quality of life questionnaire (IBDQ) were completed. The Eetscore Food Frequency Questionnaire (Eetscore FFQ) and Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH) were used to assess diet and physical activity. Changes from baseline to 5 weeks after start were investigated by paired samples t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: We included 29 participants. At time of this preliminary analysis, 25 participants completed baseline and 5-week assessments (11 males, 11 CD, median age 36 years [IQR 29C53], median BMI 25 kg/m(2) [IQR 24C28]). After 5 weeks, diet quality had significantly improved (p<0.001), but level of physical activity had not (p=0.509). Impact of disease on daily life (IBD-DI) decreased with 2.5 points (95%CI -5.5-0.4; p=0.09). Disease activity did not change significantly. There was a significant decrease in fatigue (median IBD-F 20 [IQR 8C29] to 15 [IQR 3C24; p=0.03]) and a significant increase in quality of life (median IBDQ 194 [IQR 179C206] to 196 [IQR 186C209; p=0.03]). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that a combined lifestyle intervention is effective to reduce fatigue and to increase quality of life in patients with IBD, at least in the short term. Impact of disease on daily life and clinical disease activity did not improve significantly. Participants reported their level of physical activity to be restricted due to COVID-19 measures, which could explain the lack of effect on this outcome.

Since Reinemann et al. demonstrated the reliability and validity of RTR with physical input devices in laboratory experimental study designs in this journal 15 years ago, measurement technology has experienced an instrumental change characterized by its virtualization. At the same time, there still is little methodological knowledge available about the fundamental changes in this key technology. Therefore, this article examines the extent to which data collected in a field study using a virtualized RTR-Measurement tool meet established standards of data quality. Therefore, our first research question examines the validity of the RTR data in three ways. First, we consider construct validity. The results of our Kruskal-Wallis tests show a statistically significant differentiation of RTR rating behavior along party lines. This positive assessment is underlined by the high match score of a discriminant analysis. In a further analysis step, we implement a sparse structural equation model that assesses the relationship between party identification and RTR measurement, allowing us to draw conclusions about the construct validity of the virtualized RTR measurement. The calculated coefficients provide evidence that party identification and real-time rating are significantly and substantially associated. Although our analysis focuses merely on the partisan groups of the two candidates which parties are represented in the TV debates, in summarizing the results, we consider the question of construct validity (FF1.1) to be positively decided. As a second perspective, we investigate criterion validity. A central finding here emerges from an examination of the sparse structural equation model, at the core of which is the relationship of RTR ratings and retrospective verdicts on debate performance. Controlling for party identification, we can show that the coefficients are very strong and significant. This observation holds across all duels and candidates. We thus find a consistent pattern, which leads us to answer the question about criterion validity (FF1.2) of our virtualized RTR measure in the affirmative. As a third perspective, we focus on content validity. For this purpose, we refer to an established structural equation model that embeds the RTR signal in a complex framework of upstream and downstream variables of debate reception. Our results are broadly consistent across duels and candidates: real-time evaluations during the debate are significantly preformed by political predispositions (prior candidate evaluation). Consistent with our previous findings, perceived debate performance is largely a function of RTR ratings in this more complex model; this underscores the previously positive assessment about the criterion validity of the virtualized RTR measure. In turn, the retrospective candidate evaluations are significantly shaped by the real-time ratings and the retrospective verdicts on debate performance. Consequently, the framework used shows that the structure of debate perception in our field studies corresponds to findings known from studies in laboratory settings with physical input devices. We are therefore confident to answer the question of content validity (FF1.3) of our virtualized RTR measurement positively. Our second research question focuses on the reliability of the RTR data and examines it in two ways. First, using a resampling approach, we take a close look at the aggregated RTR time series. On the one hand, we find that virtualized RTR measures can indeed generate data whose aggregate RTR time series for two subsamples are clearly associated with each other in the resampling procedure. On the other hand, the findings are ambivalent because the existing correlations are only of moderate strength and in some cases only weak. Thus, the RTR measure seems to depend on the composition of the sample to a considerable extent. In a second analysis strategy, we check the individual RTR time series for internal consistency. Both Cronbachs alpha and McDonalds omega demonstrate a high degree of intercorrelation between the RTR ratings of the individual speech phases. When summarizing our findings on the aggregated and individual RTR time series, we must acknowledge limitations to our research question two (FF2): Virtualized RTR measurements can generate reliable data. However, this is not an automatism; rather, researchers must take special caution to ensure the conditions for an adequate study design in the online setting. Acknowledging that our results are subject to multiple limitations, we conclude that the virtualization of RTR-Measurement establishes a complementary approach to studies with a laboratory research design dominating the literature, making the analysis of viewers reactions to televised debates in natural reception situations accessible even in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Validit?t und Reliabilit?t virtualisierter RTR-Messungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microglia are specialized dynamic immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that plays a crucial role in brain homeostasis and in disease states.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate service users perceptions of MySurgery, including its perceived acceptability, the potential barriers and facilitators to accessing and using its content, and ideas about how to facilitate its effective implementation. The secondary aim is to analyze how the intended use of the app might differ for diverse patients, including seldom-heard groups. METHODS: We implemented a diversity approach to recruit participants from a range of backgrounds with previous experience of surgery. We aimed to achieve representation from seldom-heard groups, including those from a Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) background; those with a disability; and those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBT+) community. A total of 3 focus groups were conducted across a 2-month period, during which a semistructured protocol was followed to elicit a rich discussion around the app. The focus groups were audio recorded, and thematic analysis was carried out. RESULTS: In total, 22 individuals participated in the focus groups. A total of 50% (n=11) of the participants were from a BAME background, 59% (n=13) had a disability, and 36% (n=8) were from the LGBT+ community. There was a strong degree of support for the MySurgery app. The majority of participants agreed that it was acceptable and appropriate in terms of content and usability, and that it would help to educate patients about how to become involved in improving safety. The checklist-like format was popular. There was rich discussion around the accessibility and inclusivity of MySurgery. Specific user groups were identified who might face barriers in accessing the app or acting on its advice, such as those with visual impairments or learning difficulties and those who preferred to take a more passive role (eg, some individuals because of their cultural background or personality type). The app could be improved by signposting further specialty-specific information and incorporating a calendar and notes section. With regard to implementation, it was agreed that use of the app should be signposted before the preoperative appointment and that training and education should be provided for clinicians to increase awareness and buy-in. Communication about the app should clarify its scientific basis in plain English and should stress that its use is optional. CONCLUSIONS: MySurgery was endorsed as a powerful tool for enhancing patient empowerment and facilitating the direct involvement of patients and their caregivers in maintaining patient safety. The diversity approach allowed for a better understanding of the needs of different population groups and highlighted opportunities for increasing accessibility and involvement in the app.","output":"A Smartphone App Designed to Empower Patients to Contribute Toward Safer Surgical Care: Qualitative Evaluation of Diverse Public and Patient Perceptions Using Focus Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a logistic growth model, with its carrying capacity parameter allowed to also vary logistically, for modeling the cumulative number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the province of Ontario.

The shortage of resources in African countries, as well as the travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitate innovative means of training and supporting pathologists across the continent. In response to requests for training in cancer pathology, two virtual training courses were organized: one conducted in English for participants in Nigeria and another conducted in French for participants across several countries in Francophone Africa. Each course had weekly 90-minute sessions covering essential topics in cancer pathology led by global experts. Methods: Two research questions were investigated for both courses: 1) did the participants improve their knowledge of the topics covered during the course? and 2) did the course participants appreciate the virtual training format? Results: The Nigeria course enrolled 85 participants from 26 Nigerian states, while the Francophone Africa course enrolled 425 participants from 18 African countries.

To better understand how these SARS-CoV-2 lineage turnovers occurred in Brazil, we analyzed 11,724 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes of samples collected in different country regions between September 2020 and April 2021. Our findings indicate that the spatial dispersion of both variants in Brazil was driven by short and long-distance viral transmission. The lineage P.2 harboring Spike mutation E484K probably emerged around late July 2020 in the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state, which contributed with most (~50%) inter-state viral disseminations, and only became locally established in most Brazilian states by October 2020. The VOC Gamma probably arose in November 2020 in the Amazonas (AM) state, which was responsible for 60-70% of the inter-state viral dissemination, and the earliest timing of community transmission of this VOC in many Brazilian states was already traced to December 2020. We estimate that variant Gamma was 1.56-3.06 more transmissible than variant P.2 co-circulating in RJ and that the median effective reproductive number (Re) of Gamma in RJ and SP states (Re = 1.59-1.91) was lower than in AM (Re = 3.55). In summary, although the epicenter of the lineage P.2 dissemination in Brazil was the heavily interconnected Southeastern region, it displayed a slower rate of spatial spread than the VOC Gamma originated in the more isolated Northern Brazilian region.

METHODS: This study included 2996 middle-aged mothers of the Boston Birth Cohort (a sample of predominantly urban, low-income, Black and Hispanic mothers) who were enrolled shortly after they gave birth and followed onward at the Boston Medical Center. COVID-19 testing and test positivity were defined by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Two-probit Heckman selection models were performed to identify factors associated with test positivity while accounting for potential selection associated with COVID testing. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of study mothers was 41.9 (7.7) years. In the sample, 1741 (58.1%) and 667 (22.3%) mothers were self-identified as Black and Hispanic, respectively. A total of 396 mothers had COVID-19 testing and of those, 95 mothers tested positive from March 2020 to February 2021. Among a multitude of factors examined, factors associated with the probability of being tested were obesity (RR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08C1.49); and presence of preexisting chronic medical conditions including hypertension, asthma, stroke, and other comorbidities (coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and sickle cell disease) with a corresponding RR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.23C1.60); 1.29 (95% CI: 1.11C1.50); 1.44 (95% CI: 1.23C1.68); and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12C1.67), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This article sought to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and acute stress disorder among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: Adult patients recently admitted to nonintensive care unit medical ward settings with coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled patients were screened for depression, anxiety, and delirium. Subsequently, patients were followed up by phone after 2 weeks and rescreened for depression, anxiety, and acute stress disorder symptoms. Subjects' medical records were abstracted for clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 58 subjects were enrolled; of whom, 44 completed the study. Initially, 36% of subjects had elevated anxiety symptoms and 29% had elevated depression symptoms. At 2-week follow-up, 9% had elevated anxiety symptoms, 20% had elevated depression symptoms, and 25% had mild-to-moderate acute stress disorder symptoms. Discharge to home was not associated with improvement in psychiatric symptoms.

Both can induce durable responses; however, cross-trial comparisons are difficult due to differences in study design. In this study, the registration trials of axi-cel and tisa-cel were compared using a matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS A MAIC was performed to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between trials. The estimates for the ZUMA-1 (axi-cel) trial were adjusted using patient-level data to match the study population in JULIET (tisa-cel) for key variables: IPI, ECOG, stage, refractoriness or relapsed disease, double/triple hit status, cell-of-origin, and number of prior lines of therapy. The endpoints analysed were response, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. RESULTS After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between trials, axi-cel was associated with a greater objective response rate (relative risk [RR] =1.61 [95% CI 1.29-2.01]) and complete response (RR = 1.62 [1.16-2.27]) than tisa-cel among patients who underwent infusion. The OS from infusion onward comparing axi-cel to tisa-cel had a hazard ratio of 0.51 (0.31-0.83). The indirect comparison showed a higher rate of Grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in ZUMA-1 compared with JULIET; (RR =2.03 [1.55-2.65]) and similar rates of Grade 3 CRS and neurologic events (NE). CONCLUSIONS In the absence of a direct head-to-head study, the MAIC statistical technique suggests axi-cel may have superior efficacy but a greater risk of Grade 1-2 CRS. Future real world studies can further inform the relative efficacy and safety of CAR T therapies in RR-LBCL.","output":"Comparing Efficacy, Safety, and Pre-Infusion Period of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel vs Tisagenlecleucel in Relapsed/Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Working from home has brought a number of changes in the lives, habits and ways of working of many employees.

In the same period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, Ethiopia under the COVAX facility has begun vaccinating high risk populations but due to vaccine supply shortages and the absence of an effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, still remain the most effective methods of controlling the pandemic as recommended by WHO. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs at different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results indicated that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the models indicate that the projected number of hospital cases during the peak time is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within the health system capacity, the government should pay attention to the strict implementation of the existing NPIs or impose additional public health measures.","output":"Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on the dynamics of COVID-19: A mathematical modelling study of the case of Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 spreading rapidly throughout the world was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Demographic data, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers, including C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, as well as patient outcomes, were compared between men and women. During the study period, 701 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted. The patient's mean age was 6117 years. There were 370 men (52.8%). There was no difference in age, racial distribution, and comorbidities in the male patients compared with the female patients. However, both the baseline and peak levels of CRP and ferritin were significantly higher in men as compared with women. While the baseline D-dimer was similar between the sexes, men had a significantly higher maximal D-dimer. Men had evidence of greater disease severity, with a significantly greater admission to the intensive care unit and borderline higher hospital mortality. Our study supports the observation that COVID-19 causes more severe disease in men. The greater disease severity in men was not due to the effect of age or comorbidities; however, in keeping with experimental studies, men had evidence of a heightened inflammatory response, likely contributing to disease severity.","output":"Gender-based disparities in COVID-19 patient outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a great threat to public health, which has greatly impacted the study and life of undergraduate students in China.

This paper presents a simplified and amended account of the main findings of a recent ethical analysis of medical age assessment in the asylum process commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. A number of ethical challenges related to conflicting goals, equality and fairness, autonomy and informed consent, privacy and integrity, and professional values and roles are identified and analysed. It is concluded that most of these challenges can be met, but that this requires a system where the assessment is sufficiently accurate and where adequate safeguards are in place. Two important ethical questions are found to warrant further analysis. The first is whether asylum seekers consent to the procedure can be considered genuinely voluntary. The second is whether and how medical age assessments could affect negative public attitudes towards asylum seekers or discriminatory societal views more generally.","output":"Ethical aspects of medical age assessment in the asylum process: a Swedish perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human networks. The real-space urban life of people is modeled as a modified scale-free network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted in several studies for modeling on-line communities so far but is modified here for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. Furthermore, the networks have been extended by introducing multiple cliques in the initial step of network construction and enabling people to zero-degree people as well as popular (large degree) people. As a result, four findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the \\"second waves\\" occur without external influence or constraints on contacts or the releasing of the constraints. These second waves, mostly lower than the first wave, implies the bridges between infected and fresh clusters may trigger new expansions of spreading. Second, if the network changes the structure on the way of infection spreading or after its suppression, the peak of the second wave can be larger than the first. Third, the peak height in the time series depends on the difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member accepts to meet and the number of people one chooses to meet. This tendency is observed for two kinds of artificial networks and implies the impact of the bridges between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the release of once given constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time series without introducing any constraint from the beginning, if the release is introduced at a time close to the peak. Thus, both governments and individuals should be careful in returning to human society with inter-community contacts.","output":"Stay with Your Community: Bridges between Clusters Trigger Expansion of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to expand. Herein, we report the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a multicenter study conducted in four cities in China excluding Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 478 patients transferred by emergency medical services to designated hospitals in four major cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan, and Nanning) were enrolled. We compared the characteristics of imported and indigenous cases and calculated the frequencies of fatal, severe, mild, and asymptomatic disease. The results were used to generate a pyramid of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 46.9 years and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (69.7%), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%), and headache (7.9%). Most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. Imported cases dominated during the early stages of the pandemic, but decreased from 1 February 2020 as indigenous cases rose sharply. Compared with indigenous cases, imported cases differed significantly in terms of sex (P = 0.002), severity of disease (P = 0.006), occurrence of fever (P < 0.001), family clustering (P < 0.001), history of contact (P < 0.001), and primary outcome (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Within the population studied, imported cases had distinct characteristics from those of indigenous cases, with lower fatality rates and higher discharge rates.

Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiation therapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. RESULTS: Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of patients with breast cancer and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or postmastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective.

Spatter generation was attributed to a number of sources including incorrect machine settings, surface contaminants, and erratic wire feeding. Random variation of different welding process parameters such as voltage, wire feed speed, and torch travel angle, affected spatter production, which served as a motivation to embark on a systematic study involving design of experiments. A total of ten most significant parameters were identified through a brainstorming process involving robotic cell operators, section managers, and subject matter experts. Using the selected ten parameters, preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate operating range for each process parameter that has the most significant impact on weld spatter. An Orthogonal L16 Array from Taguchis designs was chosen with four parameters at 4-levels, four parameters at 2-levels, and two parameters were held constant at 1-level. Following the establishment of a defined set of parameters and corresponding ranges of values, a series of designed experiments were conducted to measure the effect of process parameters on weld spatter production. During each designed experiment, six different responses were recorded that included, the weight of wire used, the weight of the weld bead deposited, the mass of spatter collected in a tray, audio signals generated, the spatter particle count using ImageJ, and the quality of the weld bead.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a worldwide threat that has already caused more than 3 000 000 deaths. It is characterized by different patterns of disease evolution depending on host factors among which old-age and pre-existing comorbidities play a detrimental role. Previous coronavirus epidemics, notably SARS-CoV, were associated with increased serum neopterin levels, which can be interpreted as a sign of acute innate immunity in response to viral infection. Here we hypothesize that neopterin may serve as a biomarker of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and Covid-19 disease severity. METHODS: We measured neopterin blood levels by ELISA. Seric concentration was quantified from 256 healthy donors and 374 Covid-19 patients at hospital admission. Enrolled Covid-19 patients were all symptomatic and displayed a large spectrum of comorbidities. Patients were followed until disease resolution or death. RESULTS: Severe and critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were characterized by a profound exacerbation of immune activation characterized by elevated neopterin blood levels. Systemic neopterin levels above 19nM stratified healthy individuals from Covid-19 patients with 87% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, systemic neopterin levels above 53nM differentiated non-survivors from survivors with 64% specificity and 100% sensitivity.

Finally, we offer a series of recommendations about how machine learning researchers can produce both research and algorithms that more carefully engage with questions of sex/gender, better serving all patients, including transgender people.","output":"Sex Trouble: Common pitfalls in incorporating sex/gender in medical machine learning and how to avoid them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge Base Completion has been a very active area recently, where multiplicative models have generally outperformed additive and other deep learning methods -- like GNN, CNN, path-based models.

We found that about three-quarters of respondents were simply buying the food they could get due to out of stock situations and about half the participants bought more food than usual. As a result of foodservice closures, consumers indicated purchasing more groceries than normal. Consumers attempted to avoid shopping in stores, relying heavily on grocery delivery and pick-up services during the beginning of the pandemic when no clear rules were in place. Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe.

The aim was to compare acute strength of various endoscopic colonic closure techniques by assessing air leak pressures in a previously described ex vivo experimental apparatus. METHODS Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed on a bench. Six techniques included surgical suture (gold standard), QuickClips, T-tags, over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) system, and two types of flexible stapler (Covidien). After closure, each specimen was fixed in the apparatus and pressure was gradually increased until air bubbles were seen. Leak pressure was the primary outcome parameter. Closure using the gold standard (first 15 experiments) resulted in a mean leak pressure of 86.9 mmHg (SD 7). Using a noninferiority design a sample size of 12 specimens for each closure technique was determined. RESULTS Mean colotomy leak pressures in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and difference (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) between each technique and the gold standard were: QuickClips 85.1 (difference -1.8; 95% CI -7.0 to 3.9); T-tags 53.9 (difference -33.0; -39.0 to -27.0); OTSC 90.3 mmHg (difference 3.4; -6.1 to 12.9); 15-mm shaft stapler 98.5 mmHg (difference 9.7; 0.8 to 18.5) and 8-mm shaft stapler 96.6 mmHg (difference 11.6; 1.5 to 21.7). CONCLUSIONS OTSCs, QuickClips, and both flexible staplers produced results comparable to hand-sewn colotomy closure in this ex vivo porcine colonic model.

Results show that the Alert Level-4 lockdown had the largest, significant, and negative effect on electricity demand compared to other containment level measures. Specifically, Alert Level 4 resulted in a 12 % reduction in wholesale electricity demand. Structural breaks in the data are evident as containment progressed to Alert Level 1. This unprecedented experiment provides insights into underlying patterns of electricity demand, therefore, projection of economic activity. Furthermore, the analysis offers insights into the performance of the electricity market when both aggregate demand and the pattern of demand change in response to exogenous constraints.

Methods: An online survey was conducted from April to June 2021. We received replies from 424 students. The research tools used comprised a validated Doctor-Patient Communication (DPC) questionnaire, the Telehealth Satisfaction Scale (TeSS), and a self-authored questionnaire. Results: About 60% of the respondents rated communication with a doctor during the remote visit as medium, with a DPC score value in the intermediate range (36-50). Only 7.5% of students rated DPC as high (DPC score over 50). Also, satisfaction with telemedicine measured by the modified Telehealth Satisfaction Scale was assessed as intermediate by 61.3% of respondents. DPC and satisfaction with telemedicine services are better assessed by students living in large cities and those who used paid telemedicine services. Conclusions: The need to improve the quality of DPC has been observed. Also, the functioning of telemedicine platforms, with the possibility of using images in teleconsultations would be welcome, with the concomitant leveling out of the disproportions in the quality of telemedicine services and DPC between urban and rural areas, as well as between commercial and noncommercial services.

So far, whether early neurological disorders such as hyposmia or anosmia, dysgeusia or ageusia, headache and vertigo are significant in the progression to the severe form of the disease or whether they are related to entry to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves has not been determined. Considering the great similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that the severity of the condition that leads to death cannot be explained solely by lung involvement, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 potential invasion to the central nervous system is partially responsible for the severe respiratory component observed in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Role of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and neuroinvasion in COVID-19 patients disease severity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of March 2020, because of the ongoing pandemic, all sport events were suspended in Italy. The Italian Serie A league abruptly interrupted all competitions and teams could not train in a group anymore. These containment measures were gradually eased in May. The aim of this study was to ascertain the impact of the lockdown-restart transition on the body composition of a group of Italian footballers of a Serie A team during the pandemic. METHODS: The body composition of 18 male football players (age27.6  4.5 yr.) from an Italian Serie A team was studied by bioelectrical impedance (BIA). Measures were conducted after lockdown, when they restarted to train in group with the ball (T0), and after the first regular match (T1). RESULTS: Results show that there were no changes in body mass, body mass index, fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water between T0 and T1. Differently, intracellular water, extracellular water, and phase angle were changed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the lockdown did not have any impact in athletes' body composition as they kept training at home. Moreover, the BIA method was able to detect subtle signals of shift in body water compartments (intra cellular and extra cellular water) likely due to the different kind of training conducted during and after the lockdown.","output":"Body composition changes during the lockdown-restart transition due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a group of professional football players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of polycentrism, as a policy, is to promote balanced territorial development between urban centres and its hinterland by creating functional integration. In this view, polycentric urban systems are a mean to achieve a more efficient and more sustainable territorial organization than single-centric systems and small dispersed settlements. At regional/local level, an operational objective could be to move from one or two dominant regional centres (polarization) to a network of small and medium-sized centres providing regional services. This process has to be finalized through strategic alliances between cities, particularly where critical mass is lacking, and rural partnerships urban exploring common potential and joint development projects. The idea is to deliver a territorial schema to organize the connection of cities, metropolitan regions and their hinterland through infrastructures and effective services supply distribution. The negative part of this schema represents the territorial insularity effect: it is the case of those in-land areas, considered as the extreme periphery of the polycentric structure, that are not connected, in facts, with any center belonging to the top-level hierarchy adopted in the model. The study for the identification of territorial structures in Basilicata was carried out through the analysis of various variables: the demographic structure, the infrastructure endowment and organizational models that condition the territorial accessibility.

The aim of the study was to assess the SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and in a group of unexposed subjects. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was quantified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 87 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (range 7-239 days after symptom onset) and 33 unexposed donors by ex vivo ELISpot assay. Follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was performed in ten subjects up to 12 months after symptom onset. The role of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was characterized in a group of COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies were determined in serum samples. RESULTS: In 14/33 (42.4%) unexposed donors and 85/87 (97.7%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects a positive result for at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen was observed. A positive response was observed up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection (median 246 days after symptom onset; range 118-362 days). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response seems to be mainly mediated by CD4 T cells. A weak positive correlation was observed between Spike-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody titre (p 0.0028; r2 = 0.2891) and positive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was observed in 8/9 (88.9%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

In most infectious disease outbreaks, activities of some key nodes can influence rapid disease transmission in the population. Identification and immediate isolation of those influential nodes can impede the disease transmission effectively. In this paper, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method with a novel formula has been proposed to detect the influential and top ranked nodes in a complex social network, which involves analyzing and studying of structural organization of a network. In the proposed TOPSIS method, several centrality measures have been used as multi-attributes of social network or complex network. A new formula has been designed for calculating the transmission probability of an epidemic disease to identify the impact of isolating influential nodes. To verify the robustness of the proposed method, we present a comprehensive comparison with five node-ranking methods which are being used currently for assessing the importance of nodes. The key nodes can be considered as a person, community, cluster or a particular area. The Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is exploited in two real networks to examine the spreading ability of the nodes, and the results of comparison experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact;and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially channeled the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress.

Results 549 men (24,2%) and women answered the e-survey from March 21 to April 16, 2020 (Table 1). We found poor difference between people with/without chronic disease. Surprisingly, they seemed to go out as often. Medical reasons were more frequent in cardiac patients than in persons without any disease. Conclusion Preliminary results show surprising comparable behaviors between people with/without chronic disease who still go out despite the stay at home recommendations. Further qualitative analysis of narratives will help to understand how people decide to apply recommendations to stay at home or to go out. Complete results of this study could guide public health recommendations during pandemics.","output":"French population behaviors during lock down and confinement due to Covid-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, it was confirmed that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the recent outbreak of severe pneumonia around the world. It is confused that ACE2 is widely expressed across a variety of organs and is expressed moderately but not highly in lung, which, however, is the major infected organ. Therefore, we hypothesized that there could be some other genes playing key roles in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Here we found that AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2), a G-protein coupled receptor, has interaction with ACE2 and is highly expressed in lung with a high tissue specificity. More importantly, simulation of 3D structure based protein-protein interaction reveals that AGTR2 shows a higher binding affinity with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 than ACE2 (energy: -8.2 vs. -5.1 [kcal/mol]). A number of compounds, biologics and traditional Chinese medicine that could decrease the expression level of AGTR2 were predicted. Finally, we suggest that AGTR2 could be a putative novel gene for the the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, which could provide different insight for the research of SARS-COV-2 proteins with their receptors.","output":"AGTR2, one possible novel key gene for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic started in Italy in February 2020 with an exponential growth that has exceeded the number of cases reported in China.

This study aimed to adapt the EHL scale developed by Lichtveld et al. into the Korean language (K-EHL scale) and to verify its reliability and validity. Survey data was collected from 492 adults (19C65 years) residing in Korea. The study process included translation procedures, content validity verification, pre-testing, the actual survey, and statistical analysis for validation and selection of the final items. The scale-level content validity index was 0.92, and one item was removed. Multiple exploratory factor analyses condensed the K-EHL into 2 factors and 38 items. The Environmental health knowledge and attitude factor (14 items) measures information, feelings, and thoughts about environmental health. The Environmental health behavior factor (24 items) comprises behaviors responding to environmental health.

As a result, our district general hospital started using a new soft combination (soft-combi) casting technique for conservative management of distal radius fractures (DRFs) in an attempt to reduce follow-up attendances. To assess if radiological outcomes of soft-combi casts are better or worse than previously used rigid casts for DRFs. Twenty DRFs treated with soft-combi casts were compared with 20 DRFs treated with the old rigid cast types. Radiological parameters were measured pre-manipulation, post-manipulation, at 2-week follow-up, and at final follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed to assess for significant differences seen at follow-up between the groups. The mean loss of volar angulation seen at 2-week follow-up was 4.9 for the rigid casts vs. 1.5 for the soft-combi casts (p = 0.158; 95% CI, ? 8.17 to 1.38). The mean loss of radial height after 2 weeks was 0.2 mm vs 0.5 mm (p = 0.675; 95% CI, ? 1.09 to 1.66), and the mean loss of radial inclination was 2.0 vs 1.0 (p = 0.349; 95% CI, ? 2.96 to 1.07), respectively. The soft-combi casts appeared to be equally effective at maintaining the reduction of DRFs compared to their rigid counterparts, as no statistically significant difference was seen in our study.

METHODS: Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p<0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p<0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p<0.001).

A UK-wide cohort study tracking changes in families' mental health since early lockdown (Co-SPACE) found a significant rise in primary school-aged children's behaviour problems and associated family-related stress. Three-quarters of parents in Co-SPACE also reported wanting extra support. In SPARKLE, we will examine whether providing Co-SPACE families with a smartphone application delivering information and parenting support, Parent Positive, can reverse the negative effects of the pandemic on children and parents. The efficacy on child and parent outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Parent Positive will be examined. We will also test whether the effects are moderated by pre-existing levels of child conduct problems and usage of Parent Positive. Exploratory analyses will examine whether other baseline characteristics or lockdown circumstances moderate the effects of Parent Positive. TRIAL DESIGN: SPARKLE is a two-arm superiority parallel group randomised controlled trial embedded in an existing large UK-wide self-selected community cohort - Co-SPACE. Those who consent to SPARKLE will be randomised 1:1 to either Parent Positive or Follow-up As Usual (FAU). PARTICIPANTS: Co-SPACE (a UK-wide longitudinal cohort study) parents aged &#8805;18 who have children aged 4-10 years will be eligible for SPARKLE. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Parent Positive: is a digital public health intervention that can be delivered rapidly at scale to support parents in managing their children's behaviour to reduce conduct problems and levels of family conflict, which were exacerbated during the first lockdown, and which may increase further in future months as families need to cope with continuous uncertainty and further disruption to their daily lives. Co-designed with parents and based on decades of parenting research, Parent Positive consists of three elements: (i) Parenting Boosters: where advice, delivered in the form of narrated animations, videos, graphics and text is provided to help parents with eight common parenting challenges; (ii) Parenting Exchange: a facilitated parent-to-parent communication and peer support platform and; (iii) Parent Resources: giving access to carefully selected high-quality, evidence-based online parenting resources. Follow-up as Usual: FAU was selected as a comparator because the public health nature meant that an active comparator was not appropriate due to the pragmatic, rapid implementation of the trial. Individuals randomised to FAU will receive no intervention for the first two months while the data for baseline (T1), T2 and T3 are collected. They will then be given full access to the app until 30th November 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES: Outcome measures will be collected remotely through Qualtrics according to the Co-SPACE schedule at baseline (T1), which will be the Co-SPACE survey data obtained immediately prior to randomisation, and then at one month (T2) and two months (T3) post-randomisation. Measures will be collected to assess group differences in child and parent outcomes, costs and service utilisation, and adverse events. Usage of Parent Positive will also be tracked. The primary outcome is parent-reported child conduct problems at one-month post-randomisation measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire conduct problems subscale. RANDOMISATION: Enrolled participants will be allocated to Parent Positive or FAU at the ratio of 1:1 by simple randomisation using the Randomizer function within the Qualtrics programme. Neither blocking nor stratification will be used. BLINDING (MASKING): It is not possible to blind parents enrolled in the study and Qualtrics will automatically inform parents of their group allocation. Blinded members of the research team and the senior statistician will not be given access to the Qualtrics system or the data in order to remain blinded until after the analysis is complete. We do not anticipate any serious harms associated with taking part in the intervention, therefore there will be no need to unblind any blinded staff during the study. The junior statistician will be unblinded throughout.

AIM To explore how general practitioners (GPs) experienced discussing values, goals and preferences with patients during COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING Qualitative research in general practice. METHODS Semi-structured interviews for which Dutch GPs were recruited via purposive sampling. Content analysis was used. RESULTS Fifteen GPs were interviewed. Six themes were identified: (i) urge of advance care planning, (ii) the GP's perceived role in it, (iii) preparations for it, (iv) (proactively) discussing it, (v) essentials for good communication and (vi) advance care planning in the (near) future. Calls for proactively discussing advance care planning in the media and in COVID-guidelines caused awareness of it's importance. GPs envisaged an important role for themselves in initiating it, especially with patients at risk to deteriorate or die from COVID-19. Timing advance care planning appeared difficult but crucial. The recommended digital way of communication was considered problematic due to missing nonverbal communication and difficulties in involving relatives. It was noted that admission to the ICU, which was hardly discussed before the COVID-19 pandemic, should remain a topic during advance care planning. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic brought advance care planning into a new light, GPs were more experienced with discussing it and patients were more aware of their frailty. Because of the nearing 'grey wave', advance care planning should remain top priority. Therefore, it should be central in GP and post-academic training.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: A tipping point for advance care planning?

The nuclear export protein (XPO1) has a direct role in the export of SARS-CoV proteins including ORF3b, ORF9b, and nucleocapsid. Inhibition of XPO1 induces anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and antioxidant pathways. Selinexor is an FDA-approved XPO1 inhibitor. Through bioinformatics analysis, we predicted nuclear export sequences in the ACE-2 protein and confirmed by in vitro testing that inhibition of XPO1 with selinexor induces nuclear localization of ACE-2. Administration of selinexor inhibited viral infection prophylactically as well as therapeutically in vitro. In a ferret model of COVID-19, selinexor treatment reduced viral load in the lungs and protected against tissue damage in the nasal turbinates and lungs in vivo. Our studies demonstrated that selinexor downregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, TNF-, and GMCSF, commonly associated with the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients.

The precise mechanisms of intestinal dysfunction during this period are not fully understood, although these can be alleviated by phlorotannins, including eckol.

The biological roles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in intestinal development were investigated by assessing intestinal wound healing and barrier functions, as well as the associated signaling pathways and oxidative stress levels. We identified 890 DEGs in the intestine, whose expression was altered by eckol treatment, including pancreatic and duodenal homeobox (PDX)1, which directly regulate heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF) expression in order to preserve intestinal barrier functions and promote wound healing through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and P38 signaling. Additionally, eckol alleviated H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress through PI3K/AKT, P38, and 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, improved growth, and reduced oxidative stress and intestinal permeability in pigs during the weaning period. Eckol modulates intestinal barrier functions, wound healing, and oxidative stress through PDX/HBEGF, and improves growth during the suckling-to-weaning transition.

In the UK, ~50% of survivors will require additional rehabilitation. Despite this, there is currently no evidence-based guideline available in England and Wales that addresses the identification, timing and nature of effective interventions to manage the morbidity associated following COVID-19. It is now timely to accelerate the development and evaluation of a rehabilitation service to support patients and healthcare services. Nuffield Health have responded by configuring a scalable rehabilitation pathway addressing the immediate requirements for those recovering from COVID-19 in the community. Methods and Analysis: This long-term evaluation will examine the effectiveness of a 12-week community rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 patients who have been discharged following in-patient treatment. Consisting of two distinct 6-week phases; Phase 1 is an entirely remote service, delivered via digital applications. Phase 2 sees the same patients transition into a gym-based setting for supervised group-based rehabilitation. Trained rehabilitation specialists will coach patients across areas such as goal setting, exercise prescription, symptom management and emotional well-being. Outcomes will be collected at 0, 6, and 12 weeks and at 6- and 12-months. Primary outcome measures will assess changes in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and COVID-19 symptoms using EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) and Dyspnea-12, respectively. Secondary outcome measures of the Duke Activity Status Questionnaire (DASI), 30 s sit to stand test, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) will allow for the evaluation of outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Owing to its hypervascular nature and submucosal location, bladder PGL was suspected on ultrasound and CT findings and successfully diagnosed before surgery through biochemical confirmation. It was managed by cystoscopy-guided laparoscopic partial cystectomy (LPC) with good oncological and urinary outcomes, as well as no compromise of her fertility potential. To our best knowledge, this is the first case to be incidentally detected on transvaginal ultrasound during evaluation for infertility.

Therefore, virus inhibition at the alveolar level would help prevent these respiratory complications. METHOD A literature search was conducted to collect physicochemical properties of small molecule compounds that could be used for the COVID-19 treatment. Compounds with a low melting point were selected along with those soluble in ethanol, hydrogen-bond donors, and acceptors. RESULTS There are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus inhibitors with physicochemical properties suitable for the formulation as an ultrafine pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). Mycophenolic acid, Debio 025, and cyclosporine A are prime candidates among these compounds. Cyclosporine A (hereafter cyclosporine) is a potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, and it has been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, demonstrating an improved survival rate. Also, inhalation therapy of nebulised cyclosporine was tolerated, which was used for patients with lung transplants. Finally, cyclosporine has been formulated as a solution ultrafine pMDI. Although vaccine therapy has been started in most countries, inhalation therapies with non-immunological activities could minimise the spread of the disease and be used in vaccine-hesitant individuals.

The frequent substitution of the external masks with a new one will improve the filtering activity against droplets produced by cough or sneezes of the patient. The use of respiratory masks may be suggested in hospitals or in restricted ventilated areas where, even if coronavirus variant is considered an environmental contaminant more than a respiratory risk, droplets nuclei may persist in the air and add consistent dangers to the heath-care givers. Considering that large and medium droplets may infect floors and surfaces, in addition to gloves, gowns, masks and eyes protection, the available list of viral and bacterial factors implicated in SARS ethiology suggests a better hand antisepsis using frequently the alcohol based gels (containing an high percentage of emollients substances), if available. A liquid soap with triclosan can also be used, if the health-care workers compliance to hand washing increases, as expected in this explosive situation. On the basis of the results of some experimental data, the environmental disinfection may be effected with ethyl alcohol 70% in water. Disinfection of floors or larger surfaces may be obtained with chlorine compounds solutions, after an accurate pre-cleaning. When corrosion, bleaching or gas production have to be avoided, chlorine compounds may be substituted by phenolic detergent disinfectants.","output":"[SARS: diagnosis, therapy, and especially prevention]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES We evaluated the acceptance of synchronous (live video) telehealth for pediatric dermatology. METHODS This was a prospective, single-center study of patient and dermatologist surveys paired at the encounter level for telehealth encounters with Children's Hospital Colorado Pediatric Dermatology Clinic between 21 April 2020 and 22 May 2020. RESULTS Dermatologists were most receptive to a telehealth encounter for isotretinoin monitoring (96.6%) and non-isotretinoin acne (89.5%). In contrast, 71.8% and 58.8% of patients surveyed were open to telehealth for isotretinoin encounters and non-isotretinoin acne encounters, respectively. There was no significant correlation between patient and dermatologist satisfaction regarding a telehealth encounter (r = 0.09, CI [-0.09, 0.26], p = .34) or between patient and dermatologist preference for telehealth encounter (r = 0.07, CI [-0.11, 0.25] p = .46). Dermatologists reported needing a photo to aid their physical examination in 38/363 (10.7%) of encounters and preferred in-person examinations when an encounter would have benefitted from laboratories, procedures, dermatoscopic examination, examination by palpation, and accurate weights in infants. CONCLUSIONS Synchronous, live-video telehealth is an effective method of healthcare delivery in certain situations for pediatric dermatology, but it does not replace in-person encounters.

Unfortunately, these appointments have a very high no show rate and are only offered to a select group of patients who can show up to clinic in person. During COVID19 public health emergency as CMS started to reimburse video visits, our clinic switched to offer video visits one week following hospital stay. Whether video visits are effective for post-hospital follow-up is not known. Objective: The aim of this study is to understand the impact of post-hospital video visits in diabetic population outcomes and clinic utilization. Methods: We completed a retrospective chart review of patients with diabetes who had a follow-up appointment one week after discharge in 2019(August, September and October) and 2020(August, September and October). We compared no-show rates, utilization of physicians versus APPs, reduction in A1c between two groups. Results: August to November 2019, 42 office appointments were scheduled. 24/42 appointments were completed, and the no show rate was at 42%. Previsit (hospital) average A1c was 8.03%, which improved to an average of 7.4% 3 months following appointment. 92% of all appointments were completed by physicians, and 8% were completed by an APP. August to November 2020, 100 posthospital appointments were scheduled for diabetes service patients. 70 of 100(70%) agreed to complete video visits, 29/100 preferred office appointments. In video visit group, no show rate was only (8/70) 11%. Video visit group had a previsit (hospital) average A1c: 8.3%, 3 months after video visit average A1c improved to 6.3%. 32% of post-discharge visits were completed by a physician, 67% of were completed by an APP.

While many COVID-19 trials have sought to manipulate SARS-CoV-2 or dampen the inflammatory response once patients are hospitalised, few examine therapeutics to prevent the need for hospitalisation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated and inexpensive, and holds particular promise to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Successful outpatient treatment of COVID-19 could greatly reduce morbidity, mortality and the demand for rare or expensive care resources (front-line healthcare workers, hospital beds, ventilators, biological therapies), to the benefit of both resource-replete and resource-poor regions.","output":"Anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 infection: the case for colchicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui gambaran resiliensi guru PAUD selama menghadapi beragam tantangan dalam Belajar Dari Rumah (BDR) selama masa pandemi COVID-19.

Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a populations heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the populations heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.","output":"Heterogeneity matters: Contact structure and individual variation shape epidemic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Institutions' role in postpandemic support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doba koronavirov krize zashla prakticky ka?dy aspekt na?eho ?ivota.

We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index ([SpO2/FIO2]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multi-centered retrospective observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (&#8804;48 hours of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (>48 hours). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary endpoints including time specific mortality, need for ECMO, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS: 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. 164 (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. 108 subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs. 53.2%; P=0.18) or any of the secondary endpoints between early and late HFNC failure groups. This remained true even when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review, HFNC was a viable strategy and mechanical ventilation was avoided in the majority of subjects. In the minority that progressed to mechanical ventilation, duration of HFNC did not differentiate subjects with worse clinical outcomes. The ROX index was sensitive for the identification of subjects successfully weaned from HFNC. Prospective studies in COVID-19 are warranted to confirm these findings and to optimize patient selection for use of HFNC in this disease.","output":"High-flow nasal cannula in COVID-19: Outcomes of application and examination of the ROX index to predict success"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vaccines developed over the first two hundred years since Jenner's lifetime have accomplished striking reductions of infection and disease wherever applied.

METHODS: This is an observational study that included all chronic hemodialysis patients in Lebanon who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 31st March to 1st November 2020. Data on demographics, comorbidities, admission to hospital and outcome were collected retrospectively from the patients medical records. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were included. Mean age was 61.46  13.99 years with a sex ratio of 128 males to 103 females. Around half of the patients were diabetics, 79.2% presented with fever.

Qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on food decisions of UK families are scarce. This study aimed to explore how the measures to control the spread of COVID-19 influenced the food-related decisions of socioeconomically deprived families in Northern Ireland. METHODS: A qualitative study captured data from online individual interviews. Participation was open for parents of children 2C17 years old living on a tight budget in urban and rural areas of Northern Ireland. A sampling matrix enabled equal representation of single- and two-parent households, as well as parents of younger children (<12y) and adolescents (12y). Data were collected by using the methods of Photovoice and mapping exercise. Data were analysed through a thematic approach. RESULTS: Twelve online interviews were conducted and five distinct themes were identified reflecting families food-related decisions that were affected by the COVID-19 lockdown: 1) food planning; 2) food purchasing; 3) meal preparation; 4) eating and feeding behaviours and 5) eating food prepared outside the house.

The findings indicate that firms seem to have a tendency to hoard more cash and also reduce overinvestments during Covid 19 pandemic that are consistent with the theory of precautionary motive. This research further shows that overinvestment firms still reserve less cash than other firms during the pandemic.

The objective of the present study was to describe self-perceived EBM competencies in physicians and medical students enrolled in a massive virtual EBM course. METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study. People interested in a free virtual EBM course fulfilled their data in a virtual form for their registration in September 2020. In this form, 22 competencies related to four dimensions of EBM were evaluated: asking a clinical question, search, analysis, and application; using a 5-option Likert scale. The resulting database was analyzed, selecting people who claimed to be physicians or medical students of 18 years or more. RESULTS: 1793 participants were included: 1130 medical students and 663 physicians; more than 80% lived in Peru. The frequency of participants who agreed or strongly agreed with feeling qualified in each competence ranged: from 39.2% to 57.8% for the competencies of the Asking a clinical question dimension, from 39.2% to 56.1% for Search, from 19.9% to 32.0% for Analysis, and from 19.6% to 29.9% for Application.

Methods Patients < 18 years of age who had a positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 at a single health system in central Pennsylvania from 3/19/2020-12/31/2020 were identified. Using a random number generator, 150 additional patients < 18 years of age who had a negative PCR test were also identified. Asymptomatic patients and those without clinical data in the electronic medical record were excluded from analysis. Demographic characteristics, symptoms present at the time of testing, and outcomes were compared between PCR-positive and negative patients. Odds ratios were calculated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to patients with positive vs. negative PCR tests. Results We included 544 patients in analysis, 412 (76%) of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. PCR-positive patients were statistically more likely to have a known contact, no comorbidities, and to present with cough, cold-like symptoms, headache, or loss of taste and smell. All patients who presented with loss of taste and smell were PCR positive at time of presentation. Positive patients were statistically less likely to present with fever or emesis than negative patients. Multivariable regression identified increased age, cough, cold symptoms, headache, and non-white race as predictive of PCR positivity. Patients who tested positive were statistically less likely to be admitted to the hospital and less likely to require respiratory support than negative patients. Conclusion Loss of taste and smell is a specific, though uncommon, indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. Headache, cough, and cold-like symptoms are also suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while fever and gastrointestinal symptoms appear less common.

This report details the experience hosting a virtual meeting and presents attendee feedback on the platform. METHODS AND MATERIALS The ROECSG Symposium was hosted virtually on May 15, 2020. A post-symposium survey was distributed electronically to assess attendee demographics, participation, and experience. Attendee preference and experience were queried using 3-point and 5-point Likert-type scales, respectively. Symplur LLC was used to generate analytics for the conference hashtag (#ROECSG). RESULTS The survey was distributed to all 286 registrants with a response rate of 67% (n=191). Seventeen non-attendee responses were omitted from this analysis, for a total of 174 respondents included. Forty-seven percent (n=82) of attendees were present for the entire symposium. A preference for a virtual symposium was expressed by 45% (n=78) of respondents, while 25% (n=44) had no preference and 30% (n=52) preferred an in-person meeting; 86% (n=150) of respondents rated the symposium as \\"extremely\\" well-organized. Respondents who had not attended a prior in-person ROECSG symposium were more likely to prefer the virtual format (p=0.03). Respondents reported a preference for the virtual platform for reviewing scholarly work (n=78, 45%) and an in-person platform for networking (n=103, 59%). On the day of the symposium, #ROECSG had 408 tweets and 432,504 impressions. CONCLUSIONS The 2020 ROECSG Symposium was well-received and can serve as a framework for future virtual meetings. While the virtual setting may facilitate sharing research, networking aspects are more limited. Effort is needed to develop hybrid virtual/in-person meetings that meet the needs of participants in both settings. Social media is a significant avenue for dissemination and discussion of information, and may be valuable in the virtual setting.","output":"The Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group 2020 Spring Symposium: Is Virtual the New Reality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs) Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The due diligence standard has played a significant role in preventing human rights violations, including racial discrimination.

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (,,,), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under -CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and -CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a -CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","output":"Properties of Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Repurposing existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10C28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices.

It has a cosmopolitan distribution and exists in the environment as a saprotroph on decaying plant matter. Azoles, which target Cyp51A in the ergosterol synthesis pathway, are the primary class of drugs used to treat aspergillosis. Azoles are also used to combat plant pathogenic fungi. Recently, an increasing number of azole-naive patients have presented with pan-azoleCresistant strains of A. fumigatus. The TR(34)/L98H and TR(46)/Y121F/T289A alleles in the cyp51A gene are the most common ones conferring pan-azole resistance. There is evidence that these mutations arose in agricultural settings; therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to identify azole resistance in environmental A. fumigatus and to determine where resistance is developing in the environment. Here, we summarize the global occurrence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus in the environment based on available literature. Additionally, we have created an interactive world map showing where resistant isolates have been detected and include information on the specific alleles identified, environmental settings, and azole fungicide use. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus has been found on every continent, except for Antarctica, with the highest number of reports from Europe. Developed environments, specifically hospitals and gardens, were the most common settings where azole-resistant A. fumigatus was detected, followed by soils sampled from agricultural settings. The TR(34)/L98H resistance allele was the most common in all regions except South America where the TR(46)/Y121F/T289A allele was the most common. A major consideration in interpreting this survey of the literature is sampling bias; regions and environments that have been extensively sampled are more likely to show greater azole resistance even though resistance could be more prevalent in areas that are under-sampled or not sampled at all. Increased surveillance to pinpoint reservoirs, as well as antifungal stewardship, is needed to preserve this class of antifungals for crop protection and human health.","output":"Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in the environment: Identifying key reservoirs and hotspots of antifungal resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Efficacious vaccines are urgently needed to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A candidate vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a full-length and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS: In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2a trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years (cohort 1) and those 65 years of age or older (cohort 3) to receive the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 51010 viral particles (low dose) or 11011 viral particles (high dose) per milliliter or placebo in a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule. RESULTS: After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354) and reached 100% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488), regardless of vaccine dose or age group. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells.

Controls showed a high resident population of sinusoidal macrophages that had variable ACE2 expression. Histologic findings in the cases included periportal/lobular inflammation. SARS-CoV2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were detected in situ in 2/9 COVID-19 livers in low amounts. In 9/9 cases, there was ample in situ SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that co-localized with viral matrix and envelope proteins. The number of cells positive for spike/100 field was significantly greater in the AUD/COVID-19 cases (mean 5.9) versus the non-AUD/COVID-19 cases (mean 0.4, p < 0.001) which was corroborated by Western blots. ACE2+ cells were 10 greater in AUD/COVID-19 livers versus the other COVID-19/control liver samples (p < 0.001). Co-expression experiments showed that the spike protein localized to the ACE2 positive macrophages and, in the AUD cases, hepatic stellate cells that were activated as evidenced by IL6 and TNF expression. Injection of the S1, but not S2, subunit of spike in mice induced hepatic lobular inflammation in activated macrophages. It is concluded that endocytosed viral spike protein can induce hepatitis in fatal COVID-19. This spike induced hepatitis is more robust in the livers with pre-existing AUD which may relate to why patients with alcohol abuse are at higher risk of severe liver disease with SARS-CoV2 infection.","output":"The histologic and molecular correlates of liver disease in fatal COVID-19 including with alcohol use disorder()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Participatory epidemiology is an emerging field harnessing consumer data entries of symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to explore the potential contribution of Ada data to syndromic surveillance by comparing symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) entered by Ada users in Germany with data from a national population-based reporting system called GrippeWeb. METHODS: We extracted data for all assessments performed by Ada users in Germany over 3 seasons (2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20) and identified those with ILI (report of fever with cough or sore throat). The weekly proportion of assessments in which ILI was reported was calculated (overall and stratified by age group), standardized for the German population, and compared with trends in ILI rates reported by GrippeWeb using time series graphs, scatterplots, and Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: In total, 2.1 million Ada assessments (for any symptoms) were included.

As community transmission of COVID-19 advances, our objective is to understand the age trends for COVID-19 across a regional health system. Methods A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 test results from a regional health system laboratory from March 16th - November 15th, 2020 was conducted. All COVID-19 inpatient admissions and mortality data for the same time was included. Positivity rate, proportion of positive tests and hospitalization, along with mortality rates were calculated. Results A total of 484,824 results were reviewed of which 21,109 was positive (4.4%). Individuals under the age of thirty accounted for 39% of positive tests whereas 20% was from those sixty and above. Among those hospitalized, 11% were < 30 years and 60% were 60 years, approximately six times more hospitalization for patients of older age (proportion p-value < 0.001). Inpatient mortality rate for patients < 30 years was 0% versus 13% for patients 60 years (p-value < 0.001). The highest mortality rate (28%) was among patients 90 years.

Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of quantitative understanding of the time dependence of the outcome. In this paper, our main objective is to gather understanding of the dependence of outcome on the rate of progress of HI.

We achieve such a classification by employing different rates of recovery of vulnerables vis-a-vis resilients. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population, and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. Our results quantify the adverse effects on the recovery rates of vulnerables in the course of attaining the herd immunity. We find the important result that a slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, a slower progress towards HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.","output":"Attainment of Herd Immunity: Mathematical Modelling of Survival Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study uses data from the French National Health Data System to assess the decline in the use of intravitreal antiCvascular endothelial growth factors before, during, and after pandemic-associated lockdown periods.","output":"Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Use in France During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to document the narratives that emerged in favour of and against the austerity measures proposed by the Auckland Council, with specific reference to performing arts organisations (PAOs) in the aftermath of the pandemic 2020. Design/methodology/approach: Written submissions from stakeholders received in response to austerity measures were analysed to identify the arguments presented to support/oppose funding cuts to PAOs. These narratives were thematically grouped into accounting, political, artistic and social categories to deliberate on the tensions that exist between these when funding PAOs. Findings: This study identifies the arguments presented by grass-root PAOs on the rationale of their existence from a Pacific perspective. The analysis suggests that accounting, hitherto considered as a sword can also be used as a shield if PAOs direct their research accordingly and offers future research directions. Originality/value: Prior studies concerning funding difficulties of PAOs have relied on opinions obtained ex-post from selected stakeholders. There are no known studies, which factor the opinions of grass-root PAOs, captured during funding deliberations. This study bridges this gap in the New Zealand setting by providing an analysis of grass-root opinions from the Pacific perspective, conducted during a funding deliberation. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Pandemic and the performing arts in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Because of the unprecedented disruption of health care services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) identified an urgent need to issue practice recommendations for radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer (HNC) in a time of limited resources and heightened risk for patients and staff. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (&#8805;80%) and agreement (&#8805;66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.","output":"Practice recommendations for risk-adapted head and neck cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ASTRO-ESTRO consensus statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Real-world evidence on inactivated COVID-19 vaccines against the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 is limited, leaving an important gap in the evidence base about inactivated COVID-19 vaccines for use by immunization programs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate inactivated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the B.1.617.2 variant. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was based on the first outbreak of the B.1.617.2 variant in mainland China that was discovered and traced in Guangdong in May and June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 10 805 adult case patients with laboratory-confirmed infection and close contacts. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were categorized as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (1 dose), and fully vaccinated (2 doses). We estimated VE against the primary outcome of pneumonia and the secondary outcomes of infections, symptomatic infections, and severe or critical illness associated with the B.1.617.2 variant. RESULTS: Results are reported in the order of outcome severity. Of 10 805 participants, 1.3% contracted infections, 1.2% developed symptomatic infections, 1.1% had pneumonia, and 0.2% had severe or critical illness. The adjusted VEs of full vaccination were 51.8% (95% CI, 20.3% to 83.2%) against infection, 60.4% (CI, 31.8% to 88.9%) against symptomatic infection, and 78.4% (CI, 56.9% to 99.9%) against pneumonia. Also, full vaccination was 100% (CI, 98.4% to 100.0%) effective against severe or critical illness. By contrast, the adjusted VEs of partial vaccination against infection, symptomatic infection, and pneumonia were 10.7% (CI, ?41.2% to 62.6%), 6.8% (CI, ?47.4% to 61.0%), and 11.6% (CI, ?42.6% to 65.8%), respectively. LIMITATION: Observational study with possible unmeasured confounders; insufficient data to do reliable subgroup analyses by age and vaccine brand.

Advancing technologies (e.g., video-chat) may be useful in alleviating consequences of risk-reduction efforts, including loneliness, by improving access to alternative connection/communication across the lifespan. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between technology use and individuals as this may contribute to well-being among older adults during COVID-19 and future isolating events. Participants (N=652) aged 19+ completed a questionnaire via Amazon Mechanical Turk; demographic, socialization, and technology-use data were collected. Respondents (MAge=45.1515.81) were generally male (50.1%) and white (77.3%). In-person communication and video-chat were analyzed descriptively and with binary regressions. Results of a Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that video-chat (mean rank=228.45) was reported at higher frequency of use versus in-person conversations (mean-rank=202.48), Z=-4.8,p<.001). Additionally, being female positively predicted use of video chat (B=0.42,p<.05) while increasing age negatively predicted use (B=-0.01,p<.05). Regression results suggest that populations reporting higher video-chat communication (e.g., females, younger adults) may be motivated by maintaining social connectedness despite distancing and/or are committed to healthy behaviors, increasing aversion to in-person experiences. In contrast, it may be that persons reporting low video-chat use (e.g., males, older adults) may be less interested in distanced communication or may have lower technology comfort/access. Notably, sampling bias may influence results as data was collected online; future investigation is warranted.

The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages.

Much research has been carried out since the outbreak, but few studies have focused on the dysfunction of the adaptive immunity. METHODS: In this retrospective and multi-center study, 373 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Affiliated Hospital of Putian University were recruited. Demographic, clinical, radiological features, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed at admission and at discharge. Results of immunological tests were followed up until the patients were discharged. RESULTS: Of the 373 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 322 were in the non-severe group and 51 were in the severe group. Number of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes declined remarkably upon admission and elevated when the patients were discharged. At admission, counts of total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and levels of C3 and C4 in the severe group were lower than those in the non-severe group, whereas the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in the severe group. Counts of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes were negatively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 might target adaptive immunity and cause a decrease in lymphocytes, especially T cells and subsets. Physicians should pay close attention to the adaptive immunity of patients upon admission.

Another important concern is related to the known hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 positive patients and associated organ dysfunction that may alter the metabolism of anticoagulants. The safety of the providers performing the EBP, the position of the patient and choices for image guidance (blind, fluoroscopic) are also key considerations to review. It is also important to explore the current state of knowledge about using allogenic instead of autologous blood as well as emerging techniques to eliminate the coronavirus from the blood. OBJECTIVES In this article we pose the questions of how to manage PDPH in the COVID-19 positive patient and more specifically, the use of epidural blood patch (EBP). METHODS Literature review. RESULTS EBP is usually considered after the failure of conservative and pharmacological treatments. Because of the additional risks of EBP in COVID-19 patients it is important to also consider less traditional pharmacological treatments such as theophylinnes and cosyntropin that may offer some additional benefit for COVID-19 patient. Finally, other interventions other than EBP should also be considered including occipital nerve blocks, sphenopalatine ganglion blocks (infratemporal or transnasal). LIMITATIONS A narrative review with paucity of literature. CONCLUSION Going forward, an effective treatment for COVID-19 or a safe vaccine and a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of the virus will certainly change the risk calculus involved in performing an EBP in a COVID-19 patient.","output":"Considerations for Epidural Blood Patch and Other Postdural Puncture Headache Treatments in Patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections in Italy between August 2021 and March 2022.

We aim to describe the long-term outcomes of survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 followed up first at an outpatient facility and subsequently by telephone. METHODS: Observational prospective study conducted at a tertiary general hospital. Clinical and radiological progression was assessed and data were recorded on a standardized reporting form. Patients were divided into three groups according to Pao2/Fio2 at hospitalization: Pao2/Fio2 >300, Pao2/Fio2 300-200 and Pao2/Fio2 <200. A logistic multivariate regression model was performed to identify factors associated with persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: For facility follow up, 302 individuals were enrolled. Median follow up was 45 days after discharge; 78% (228/294) of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms (53% asthenia, 56% respiratory symptoms) and 40% (122/302) had residual pulmonary radiographic lesions. Pao2/Fio2 <200 was an independent predictor of persistent dyspnoea (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.38-2.52, p < 0.0001). Pao2/Fio2 >300 was associated with resolution of chest radiographic lesions (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.74, p < 0.0001). Fifty per cent of patients required specific medical follow up after the first consultation and were transferred to another physician.

In Japan, the number of suicides in April 2020 decreased by nearly 20% from that in 2019. To assess the impact of an infectious disease pandemic, excess mortality is often discussed. Our main purpose was evaluating excess mortality from suicide in Japan during the early pandemic period. METHODS: We used data on suicides collected by the National Police Agency of Japan until June 2020. We estimated excess mortality during the early pandemic period (March-June 2020) using a time-series model of the number of suicides before the pandemic. A quasi-Poisson model was employed for the estimation. We evaluated excess mortalities by the categories of age and sex, and by prefecture. RESULTS: No significant excess mortality was observed throughout the early pandemic; instead, a downward trend in the number of suicides for both sexes was noted. For males, negative values of excess mortalities below the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval were observed in April and May. All numbers of females during the period were included in the interval, and the excess mortalities in June were positive and higher than those in April and May. In Tokyo, the number of suicides was below the lower bound throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that various changes, such as communication, and social conditions amid the early COVID-19 pandemic induced a decrease in suicides in Japan.

This study aims to investigate the pandemic impact on pregnancy experience, rates of primary childhood immunisations and the differences in birth outcomes in during 2020 to those of previous years. METHODS: Self-reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Population-level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016C2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using anonymised individual-level, population-scale routine data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Uptake of the first three scheduled primary childhood immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. FINDINGS: The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 71% of survey respondents, who reported anxiety, stress and loneliness; this was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. There was no significant difference in annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to 2016C2019. There was an increase in late term births (42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p = 0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32C36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p = 0.001).

Each cowcalf- pair was visited three times within the first 6 weeks of life to collect data of the farm and animals, as well as blood, faecal, colostral and milk samples. An ELISA using sporozoite antigen was developed for the specific detection of anti-Cryptosporidium-IgG in blood- and colostral serum. The IgG concentration in the bloodand colostral serum was determined using radial immuno diffusion test (RID). White blood cell isolation and differential blood cell counts and California Mastitis Test were performed. Bacteriological studies on quarter-milk-samples were carried out. Cryptosporidium oocysts were diagnosed with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining, other protozoa with the SAFC method and Eimeria oocysts and helminth eggs were diagnosed with the combined sedimentation/floatation test. ELISAs were performed for the detection of rota- and coronavirus, E. coli F5 and Cryptosporidium spp. in bovine feces (bio-X Diagnostics?, Belgium). The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was 54.0% and found 7 to 20 days post natum, whereas 47.1% were suffering from diarrhea. The transfer of total IgG with the colostrum and the humoral immunity of the calf could not prevent any infection with Cryptosporidium, but the severity of the diarrhea symptoms decreased with increasing total IgG concentrations. Calves housed in open sheds showed significantly more often diarrhea, i. e. they shed more Cryptosporidium oocysts during the first 4 days and 7 to 20 days post natum, respectively.

In this approach, treatment focuses on the mental disorders of the parents as well as on the development of the young child and family relationships. This study evaluated the experiences of professionals from adult and child mental health services using this approach. The aim of the study is identifying key elements of this approach, processes involved in treatment, and barriers to its success, with the aim of contributing to the development of practice based integrated mental health care for the whole family. BACKGROUND: Parental mental disorders have an impact on parenting and child development. To stop detrimental cascade effects and prevent parent and child from being caught up in the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology, an integrated family approach in mental health care is needed. Methods: A qualitative case study design using a grounded theory approach. Data were collected through 19 group interviews of professionals (N = 37) from adult and infant mental health teams who worked together in the treatment of a family. RESULTS: Professionals from the two services were comfortable coping with complexity and felt supported to perform their treatments by staying in touch with each other in multi-disciplinary consultations.

While many scientists worldwide are trying to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of the disease and its relationship with other diseases, they are trying to find drugs that can treat Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It is reported that the incidence of COVID-19 increases in cardiovascular diseases and associated conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension in studies. That is why a large number of scientists are now questioning the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) antagonists, angiotensin-2 (Ang-2) receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers), and ACEs in COVID-19 patients. When all these facts are considered together, their potential effects may be more significant. Some researchers stated that RAS inhibitors might amplify COVID-19 severity. Per the classical knowledge, ACE-2 regulates RAS by converting Ang-2 to angiotensin-(1-7), which has antioxidant, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and protective effects on many cell types, especially cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. Local and systemic RAS components such as ACE-2, ACE, and Ang-2 and their interactions are pretty complex.

Recent COVID-19-specific enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) recommendations provide a cogent framework for managing patient care pathways and reducing health care worker (HCW) and patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. eTCB has been applied broadly and has proven to be effective in limiting fomite and droplet transmissions in hospitals and between hospitals and the surrounding community. At the same time, resource constrained conditions involving limited personal protective equipment (PPE), low testing availability, and variability in physical space can require modifications in the way hospitals implement eTCB. While eTCB has come to be viewed as a standard of practice, COVID-19 related resource constraints often require hospital implementation teams to customize eTCB solutions. We provide and describe a cross-functional, collaborative on-the-ground adaptive application of eTCB initially piloted at two hospitals and subsequently reproduced at 16 additional hospitals and health systems in the US to date. By effectively facilitating eTCB deployment, hospital leaders and practitioners can establish clearer 'zones of risk' and related protective practices that prevent transmission to HCWs and patients. We outline key insights and recommendations gained from recent implementation under the aforementioned constraints and a cross-functional team process that can be utilized by hospitals to most effectively adapt eTCB under resource constraints.","output":"Containing SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals facing finite PPE, limited testing, and physical space variability: Navigating resource constrained enhanced traffic control bundling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dataset describes factors affecting international students acceptance of Online Distance Learning (ODL) mode while pursuing oversea education during Covid-19 pandemic.

In recent decades, immune responses play an important role in bone regeneration. Innate immune responses provide a suitable inflammatory microenvironment for bone regeneration and initiate bone regeneration in the early stage of fracture repair. Adaptive immune responses maintain bone regeneration and bone remodeling. MSCs and immune cells regulate each other. All kinds of immune cells and secreted cytokines can regulate the migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, which have a strong immunomodulatory ability to these immune cells. This review mainly introduces the interaction between MSCs and immune cells on bone regeneration and its potential mechanism, and discusses the practical application in bone tissue engineering by modulating this kind of cell-to-cell crosstalk.

At our institution, we were required to reduce shoe covers, reuse face masks, and allow washable head coverings. We determined if these changes affected surgical site infection (SSI) rates. STUDY DESIGN: A single institutional study was performed to compare the SSI rates reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network in the 2 years preceding COVID-19 (PRE, January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020) with the first 12 months after the pandemic (POST, April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021). We confirmed our findings using propensity score matching and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Elimination of traditional shoe covers, disposable head covers, and single-use face masks was associated with a decreased SSI rate from 5.1% PRE to 2.6% POST (p < 0.001). Furthermore, this was despite a 14% increase in surgical volume and an increase in the number of contaminated/dirty cases (2.2% PRE vs 7.4% POST, p < 0.001). Use of disposable face masks decreased by 4.3-fold during this period from 3.5 million/y PRE to 0.8 million/y POST. Of note, inpatient hand hygiene throughout the hospital increased from 71% PRE to 85% POST (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis has practical applications as we emerge from the pandemic and make decisions regarding OR attire. These data suggest that disposable head covers and shoe covers and frequent changes of face masks are unnecessary, and discontinuation of these practices will have significant cost and environmental implications.

This increasingly frequent mode of functioning raises the question of how countries should organize their health system, according to the interactions already present between their hospitals. The objective of this study was to identify distinctive profiles of French hospitals according to their characteristics and their role in the French hospital network. METHODS: Data were extracted from the national hospital database for year 2016. The database was restricted to public hospitals that practiced medicine, surgery or obstetrics. Hospitals profiles were determined using the k-means method. The variables entered in the clustering algorithm were: the number of stays, the effective diversity of hospital activity, and a network-based mobility indicator (proportion of stays followed by another stay in a different hospital of the same Regional Hospital Group within 90 days). RESULTS: Three hospital groups were identified by the clustering algorithm. The first group was constituted of 34 large hospitals (median 82,100 annual stays, interquartile range 69,004 C 117,774) with a very diverse activity. The second group contained medium-sized hospitals (with a median of 258 beds, interquartile range 164 - 377). The third group featured less diversity regarding the type of stay (with a mean of 8 effective activity domains, standard deviation 2.73), a smaller size and a higher proportion of patients that subsequently visited other hospitals (11%). The most frequent type of patient mobility occurred from the hospitals in group 2 to the hospitals in group 1 (29%). The reverse direction was less frequent (19%).

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the potential role of intensive care unit recovery or follow-up clinics for patients surviving acute hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 27-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of asthma transferred from a community hospital to our medical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen, 180). On day 2 of her intensive care unit admission, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Her clinical status gradually improved, and she was extubated on intensive care unit day 5. She had a negative test result for coronavirus disease 2019 twice with repeated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction before being discharged to home after 10 days in the intensive care unit. Two weeks after intensive care unit discharge, the patient returned to our outpatient intensive care unit recovery clinic. At follow-up, the patient endorsed significant fatigue and exhaustion with difficulty walking, minor issues with sleep disruption, and periods of memory loss. She scored 10/12 on the short performance physical battery, indicating good physical function. She did not have signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder through self-report questionnaires. Clinically, she was considered at low risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome, but she required follow-up services to assist in navigating the healthcare system, addressing remaining symptoms, and promoting return to her pre-coronavirus disease 2019 societal role. CONCLUSION: We present this case report to suggest that patients surviving coronavirus disease 2019 with subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome will require more intense intensive care unit recovery follow-up. Patients with a higher degree of acute illness who also have pre-existing comorbidities and those of older age who survive mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 will require substantial post-intensive care unit care to mitigate and treat post-intensive care syndrome, promote reintegration into the community, and improve quality of life.","output":"Recovery from COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome: the potential role of an intensive care unit recovery clinic: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: 1.7 billion children lack access to surgical care, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

METHODS: Using medical licensing registries, pediatric surgeons practicing in 26 countries between 2015 and 2019 were identified. Countries PSWD was calculated as the ratio of pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children. The correlation between neonatal, infant and under 5 mortality rates and PSWD was assessed using Spearmans correlations and piecewise linear regression models.

However, securing and sustaining employment is exceptionally challenging for vulnerable populations who experience persistent and multiple barriers, such as mental illness, homelessness, food and housing insecurity, and marginalization. Evidence-based supported employment programs, most notably individual placement and support (IPS) are becoming a more common approach for addressing the needs of these high-risk individuals. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating an IPS program in Vancouvers downtown and Downtown Eastside (DTES). METHODS AND DESIGN: This prospective quasi-experimental study of persons with persistent and multiple barriers to employment will use a mixed-methods approach for evaluating a novel IPS program. The evaluation will consist of survey packages and interviews that will capture outcomes related to employment and well-being, as well as the experiential process of receiving individualized and integrated supports through the IPS program. A mixed-methods approach is appropriate for this study as quantitative data will provide an objective assessment of program impacts on employment and well-being outcomes over time, while qualitative data will provide an in-depth understanding of continued barriers and experiences.

METHODS: We used a qualitative-constructivist design to understand chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, as described by the participants. A sample of chiropractic practitioners (doctors of chiropractic, chiropractors) from various international locations were invited to participate. Each described the public health response to COVID-19 in their location and the actions that they took in their chiropractic practices from April 20 through May 4, 2020. A summary report was created from their responses and common themes were identified. RESULTS: Eighteen chiropractic practitioners representing 17 locations and 11 countries participated. A variety of practice environments were represented in this sample, including, solo practice, mobile practice, private hospital, US Veterans Administration health care, worksite health center, and group practice. They reported that they recognized and abided by changing governmental regulations. They observed their patients experience increased stress and mental health concerns resulting from the pandemic.

However, the increase in capabilities of these devices is met with an increase in the complexity of the overall control problem and requirement for an accurate and robust sensing modality for intent recognition. Due to its ability to precede changes in motion, surface electromyography (EMG) is widely studied as a peripheral sensing modality for capturing features of muscle activity as an input for control of powered assistive devices. In order to capture features that contribute to muscle contraction and joint motion beyond muscle activity of superficial muscles, researchers have introduced sonomyography, or real-time dynamic ultrasound imaging of skeletal muscle. However, the ability of these sonomyography features to continuously predict multiple lower-limb joint kinematics during widely varying ambulation tasks, and their potential as an input for powered multiple degree-of-freedom lower-limb assistive devices is unknown. The objective of this research is to evaluate surface EMG and sonomyography, as well as the fusion of features from both sensing modalities, as inputs to Gaussian process regression models for the continuous estimation of hip, knee and ankle angle and velocity during level walking, stair ascent/descent and ramp ascent/descent ambulation. Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian nonlinear regression model that has been introduced as an alternative to musculoskeletal model-based techniques. In this study, time-intensity features of sonomyography on both the anterior and posterior thigh along with time-domain features of surface EMG from eight muscles on the lower-limb were used to train and test subject-dependent and task-invariant Gaussian process regression models for the continuous estimation of hip, knee and ankle motion. Overall, anterior sonomyography sensor fusion with surface EMG significantly improved estimation of hip, knee and ankle motion for all ambulation tasks (level ground, stair and ramp ambulation) in comparison to surface EMG alone. Additionally, anterior sonomyography alone significantly improved errors at the hip and knee for most tasks compared to surface EMG.

We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire & Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually. Additionally, patients frequently do not comply with the advice they receive. This has implications for understanding the accuracy and efficiency of triaging systems.","output":"Patient compliance with NHS 111 advice: Analysis of adult call and ED attendance data 2013C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier studies demonstrated that blood 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is elevated in patients with COVID-19-associated diarrhea with higher severity of symptoms. We hypothesize that disruption of vectorial Cl transport by 5-HT may be critical in determining the alveolar flooding and abnormalities in intestinal Cl secretion through stimulation of anoctamin 1(ANO1) Cl channel. Using western blot, immunostaining, and electrophysiology, we characterized the localization of human ANO1 and its stimulation by 5-HT on Cl secretion in lung and intestinal epithelium. Because calcium-activated chloride current in human intestinal epithelia remains controversial, we examined the localization of ANO1 in the human terminal ileum and colonic tissue using confocal microscopy. Our results indicated that ANO1 was localized predominantly at the brush-border membrane and co-localized with the brush-border membrane marker villin. ANO1 is not present in goblet cells. The anti-ANO1 antibody recognized a protein of appropriate size in human colonic tissue. The specificity of the ANO1 antibody was tested by immunoblot analysis of lysates from human colorectal cancer tissues, where it displayed amplified ANO1 protein expression. We next confirmed ANO1-currents activated by 5-HT in the Caco-2 cells by patch-clamp measurements of whole-cell current. The application of 100 nM 5-HT produced a typical outward rectification. CaCCinh-A01, a specific ANO1 blocker, inhibited the currents. The half-maximal effective concentration value for the effects of 5-HT was estimated at 21.8  13.7 nM with a Hill coefficient of 0.89  0.16. These results indicated that 5-HT evoked calcium-activated Cl currents through ANO1 channels. ANO1 is expressed in Calu 3 cells. We next confirmed the presence of ANO1 currents activated by 5-HT in Calu-3 cells by the Ussing chamber experiments. Serosal addition of 5-HT produced an immediate and significant increase in Isc in Calu-3 cells that was inhibited by the ANO1 selective inhibitor T16Ainh-A01. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 infection led to enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia in the intestinal epithelium of Syrian Hamster with a possible elevation of 5-HT, which could explain the severity of symptoms in COVID-19 associated diarrheal patients. In conclusion, SARS-CoV2 infection resulted in intestinal enterochromaffin cells hyperplasia that could elevate 5-HT. Elevated 5-HT activates luminal ANO1 CaCC in the intestinal and lung epithelium by a mechanism that appears to involve the rise of [Ca2+ ]i . Our data suggest that 5-HT may be a critical determinant of the COVID-19 associated diarrhea and flooding of alveoli that have considerable implications for COVID-19 therapy.","output":"Elevated 5-hydroxytryptamine in COVID-19 Stimulates ANO1 Mediated Cl Secretion in Lung & Intestinal Epithelial Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the surgical treatment of gastric cancer, obesity is known to be a predictive factor for poor early surgical outcomes. To evaluate the more effective modality of laparoscopic gastrectomy in obese patients, we compared the early surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted and totally laparoscopic gastrectomy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed early surgical outcomes in 1,480 consecutive patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer between April 2004 and July 2010. To compare surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with those of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) in 76 obese patients (LADG, n = 39; TLDG, n=37), the patients were classified as either obese or nonobese. The obesity was defined using the WHO classification BMI cutoff of 30 kg/m2. RESULTS In the analysis of surgical outcomes of the LADG group, there were significant differences between the obese and nonobese groups with respect to operative time (P=0.004, obese, 171.8 min; nonobese, 141.0 min), time to first flatus (P=0.027, obese, 3.3 days; nonobese, 3.1 days), commencement of soft diet (P=0.040, obese, 4.6 days; nonobese, 4.0 days), postoperative complication rate (P=0.045, obese, 15.4%; nonobese, 6.5%), and postoperative hospital stay (P=0.014, obese, 8.9 days; nonobese, 7.2 days). In TLDG group, on the other hand, there were no significant differences in surgical outcomes between the groups. CONCLUSION Based on these findings, early surgical outcomes of LADG were strongly influenced by the obesity. TLDG without minilaparotomy, however, was unaffected by the obesity. These findings strongly suggest that TLDG could be a safe procedure to avoid the impact of obesity.","output":"A totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy can be an effective way of performing laparoscopic gastrectomy in obese patients (body mass index30)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessments of future threats posed by infection have focused largely on zoonotic, acute disease, under the rubric emerging diseases. Evolutionary and epidemiological studies indicate, however, that particular aspects of infrastructure, such as protected water supplies, vector-proof housing, and health care facilities, protect against the emergence of zoonotic, acute infectious diseases. While attention in the global health community has focused on emerging diseases, there has been a concurrent, growing recognition that important chronic diseases, such as cancer, are often caused by infectious agents that are already widespread in human populations. For economically prosperous countries, the immediacy of this threat contrasts with their infrastructural protection from severe acute infectious disease. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that chronic infectious diseases pose a more significant threat to economically prosperous countries than zoonotic, acute infectious diseases. Research efforts directed at threats posed by infection may therefore be more effective overall if increased efforts are directed toward understanding and preventing infectious causes of chronic diseases across the spectrum of economic prosperity, as well as toward specific infrastructural improvements in less prosperous countries to protect against virulent, acute infectious diseases.","output":"Evolution of virulence, environmental change, and the threat posed by emerging and chronic diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following in the footsteps of other large population neuroscience studies, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development?

Whilst crucial in controlling transmission, such messaging may have an adverse effect on individuals with OCD. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted, with a total of 332 participants recruited. Participants who scored above the optimal cut-off score on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised edition (OCI-R) were included in the analysis (n = 254). Scores on the six subscales of the OCI-R were correlated with responses to a COVID-19 Impact measure. RESULTS Factor analysis of the COVID-19 Impact measure revealed that items loaded on two components of the measure (handwashing and distress-avoidance). Canonical correlation analyses revealed significant associations between the OCI-R subscales and COVID-19 Impact measure, F (12, 490) = 8.14, p = 0.001, and the SHAI subscales with the COVID-19 Impact Measure, F (4, 498) = 8.18, p = 0.001). Specifically, washing and checking OCI-R subscales correlated with both components of the COVID-19 Impact measure, as did the health anxiety and beliefs SHAI subscales. Content analysis revealed disruption to treatment delivery and worsening symptom severity in participants with contamination-related OCD. DISCUSSION Contamination and checking OCD subtypes have been associated with increased hand-washing behaviour and avoidance of distress-inducing cues.

Lesions of the infrapopliteal arteries are the result of 2 different etiologies: medial calcification and intimal atheromatous plaque. Although several devices are available for endovascular treatment of infrapopliteal lesions, balloon angioplasty still comprises the mainstay of therapy due to a lack of purpose-built devices. The mechanism of balloon angioplasty consists of adventitial stretching, medial necrosis, and dissection or plaque fracture. In many cases, the diffuse nature of infrapopliteal disease and plaque complexity may lead to dissection, recoil, and early restenosis. Optimal balloon angioplasty requires careful attention to assessment of vessel calcification, appropriate vessel sizing, and the use of long balloons with prolonged inflation times, as outlined in a treatment algorithm based on this systematic review. Further development of specific devices for this arterial segment are warranted, including devices for preventing recoil (eg, dedicated atherectomy devices), treating dissections (eg, tacks, stents), and preventing neointimal hyperplasia (eg, novel drug delivery techniques and drug-eluting stents). Further understanding of infrapopliteal disease, along with the development of new technologies, will help optimize the durability of endovascular interventions and ultimately improve the limb-related outcomes of patients with CLTI.","output":"Balloon Angioplasty of Infrapopliteal Arteries: A Systematic Review and Proposed Algorithm for Optimal Endovascular Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An insufficient supply of suitable insects is often a major drawback when maintaining insectivorous bats in captivity A nutritionalpaste was developed and used on different occasions to temporarily maintain various insectivorous species inhealthy condition The paste can be stored without bacterial contamination when prepared carefully with freshingredients Although the prolonged use of the paste for sustenance (greater than three months) is notrecommended; it will keep insectivorous bats alive and healthy during critical periods when insects are notavailable","output":"Preparacin de una pasta alimenticia para murcilagos insectvoros y observaciones sobre su uso/ Preparation of a nutritional paste for insectivorous bats and observations on its use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identified the U.S. airports and metropolitan areas, particularly New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles, that were the most likely locations of importation and domestic spread of Omicron from South Africa.

The network makes a 24 hours forecast and is evaluated using 4 statistical parameters that are then averaged for every lockdown period to quantify the change in the model precision due to lockdown policies. For Colombia, PM2.5 predictions are better for partial and full lockdown, due to the high values produced by biomass burning (pre-lockdown) that are sub-estimated by the network. This does not happen for O3 where the model is fairly similar for the three periods, but in the full lockdown, the model has a slightly worst performance, probably because O3 in full-lockdown have an abnormal growth that leads to a sub estimation of its magnitude, even though the behavior is well represented by the model.On the other hand, the model is more precise for PM2.5 in the full and partial lockdowns possibly due to the biomass burning in pre-lockdown that produces abnormal increases of the pollutant. In terms of the ozone, the pre and partial lockdown have better performance since in the full lockdown the O3 rises to higher values than usual, which has not happened before, so the model was not able to learn this behavior in a precise manner.

We established a bioresource with serial sampling of health care workers (HCWs) designed to obtain samples before and during mainly mild disease, with follow-up sampling to evaluate the quality and duration of immune memory. Methods: We conducted a prospective study on HCWs from three hospital sites in London, initially at a single centre (recruited just prior to first peak community transmission in London), but then extended to multiple sites 3 weeks later (recruitment still ongoing, target n=1,000). Asymptomatic participants attending work complete a health questionnaire, and provide a nasal swab (for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR tests) and blood samples (mononuclear cells, serum, plasma, RNA and DNA are biobanked) at 16 weekly study visits, and at 6 and 12 months.

Relational TL enables the ML models to transfer the relationship networks from one domain to another. However, it has two critical issues. One is determining the proper way of extracting and expressing relationships among data features in the source domain such that the relationships can be transferred to the target domain. The other is how to do the transfer procedure. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are knowledge bases that use data and logic to graph-structured information;they are helpful tools for dealing with the first issue. The proposed relational feature transfer learning algorithm (RF-TL) embodies an extended structural equation modelling (SEM) as a method for constructing KGs. Additionally, in fields such as medicine, economics, and law related to peoples lives and property safety and security, the knowledge of domain experts is a gold standard. This paper introduces the causal analysis and counterfactual inference in the TL domain that directs the transfer procedure. Different from traditional feature-based TL algorithms like transfer component analysis (TCA) and CORelation Alignment (CORAL), RF-TL not only considers relations between feature items but also utilizes causality knowledge, enabling it to perform well in practical cases. The algorithm was tested on two different healthcare-related datasets  sleep apnea questionnaire study data and COVID-19 case data on ICU admission  and compared its performance with TCA and CORAL.

METHODS: Surgeons performed segmental resection of pig colon and handsewn end-to-end anastomosis while wearing eye-tracking glasses (ETG) assisted by distributed RGB-D motion sensors. To select instruments, surgeons (ST) fixed their gaze on a screen, initiating the RSN to pick up and transfer the item.

We compared two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify important differences in characteristics and therapeutic measures and their influence on the outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This multicenter prospective register study included all patients with a SARS-CoV?2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, who were treated in 1 of the 12 intensive care units (ICU) from 8 hospitals in Tyrol, Austria during 2 defined periods (1 February 2020 until 17 July: first wave and 18 July 2020 until 22 February 2021: second wave) of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 508 patients were analyzed. The majority (n = 401) presented during the second wave, where the median age was significantly higher (64 years, IQR 54C74 years vs. 72 years, IQR 62C78 years, p < 0.001). Invasive mechanical ventilation was less frequent during the second period (50.5% vs 67.3%, p = 0.003), as was the use of vasopressors (50.3% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.001) and renal replacement therapy (12.0% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.061), which resulted in shorter ICU length of stay (10 days, IQR 5C18 days vs. 18 days, IQR 5C31 days, p < 0.001). Nonetheless, ICU mortality did not change (28.9% vs. 21.5%, p = 0.159) and hospital mortality even increased (22.4% vs. 33.4%, p = 0.039) in the second period. Age, frailty and the number of comorbidities were significant predictors of hospital mortality in a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the overall cohort. CONCLUSION: Advanced treatment strategies and learning effects over time resulted in reduced rates of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use in the second wave associated with shorter ICU length of stay. Despite these improvements, age appears to be a dominant factor for hospital mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Nonetheless, despite the success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines development, COVID-19 therapy remains challenging. Several repurposed drugs that were documented to be useful in small clinical trials have been shown to be ineffective in larger studies. Additionally, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed the predominance of hyperinflammation and immune dysregulation in inducing multiorgan damage. Therefore, the potential benefits of both immune modulation and suppression in COVID-19 have been extensively discussed.

The effect of the Covid-19 outbreak raises the question of whether the idiosyncratic risk can still be ignored considering that the risk has a close relationship to firm-specific risk. This study sets a portfolio consisting of 177 active public firms in the Indonesia Stock Exchange before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. On portfolio set, idiosyncratic risk is estimated by the standard CAPM and L-CAPM in the observation range from January 2, 2019, to June 30, 2021. The results of the analysis show that L-CAPM and CAPM produce significantly different idiosyncratic risks. Empirical evidence shows that the highest firm-specific risk is in the third period and has a stable condition since the fourth period. This condition is confirmed by regression results that idiosyncratic risk together with systematic risk positively affects stock returns in the fourth period as suggested by the efficient market hypothesis. Uniquely, both systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk based on L-CAPM do not show a significant effect on stock returns in the fifth period, so it is a strong indication that liquidity is an important factor that must be considered in making investments. ?

METHODS: The model in the \\"FluAid\\" software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Atlanta) was applied to the New Zealand primary care medical workforce (i.e., general practitioners). RESULTS: At its peak (week 4) the pandemic would lead to 1.2% to 2.7% loss of medical work time, using conservative baseline assumptions. Most workdays (88%) would be lost due to illness, followed by hospitalisation (8%), and then premature death (4%). Inputs for a \\"more severe\\" scenario included greater health effects and time spent caring for sick relatives. For this scenario, 9% of medical workdays would be lost in the peak week, and 3% over a more compressed six-week period of the first pandemic wave. As with the base case, most (64%) of lost workdays would be due to illness, followed by caring for others (31%), hospitalisation (4%), and then premature death (1%).

In our trust, referrals that were not aligned with the guidance were cancelled and returned to general practitioners, providing reasons for cancellation and advising other diagnostic tests if appropriate.Methodology: In total, 1000 cases cancelled between April and August 2019 were retrospectively audited by a team of clinical specialist sonographers. Interoperator agreement against BMUS justification guidelines and safety of this cancellation process were established. Duplicate imaging referrals, referrals made that should have been placed on management pathways or referrals cancelled by the patient directly were excluded in the safety assessment. Results: There was strong agreement amongst sonographers regarding cancellations. After exclusions, 389 cases were included for review. The majority (90.5%) required no onward imaging and were therefore deemed cancelled appropriately. There were 37 patients found with pathology on subsequent imaging, two of which were found to have cancer and the remainder with benign pathology. Conclusions: Overall, we found the cancellation process to be safe and the justification document easy to utilise in practice.

Objective: We used SARS-CoV-2 RdRP as a target protein to screen for possible chemical molecules with potential anti-viral effects. Methods: Here we modelled the missing residues 896-905 via homology modelling and then analysed the interactions of Hepatitis C virus allosteric non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) in the reported NNIs binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RdRP. Results: We found that MK-3281, filibuvir, setrobuvir and dasabuvir might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRP based on their binding affinities in the respective binding sites.

Study participants were selected by systematic random sampling. A pretested and structured questionnaire adapted from different literature was used to collect data. Anthropometric measurements were taken following the standard procedure. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 290 older adults aged greater than or equal to 65 years of age were included in the study. DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive and summary statistics were employed. Multiple logistic regression was fitted to identify determinants of undernutrition. ORs and their 95% CIs were computed to determine the level of significance. OUTCOME MEASURES: Undernutrition was assessed by using Body Mass Index and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) tool. RESULTS: The prevalence of undernutrition was 27.6% (95% CI 22.4 to 32.8), and 2.1% (95% CI 0.7 to 3.8) of the study participants were overweight. Based on the MNA tool, 29.7% (95% CI 24.5 to 35.2) of the study participants were undernourished and 61.7% (95% CI 55.5 to 67.2) were at risk of undernourishment.

CONCLUSION The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a pandemic with > 3.3 million cases and 230 thousand deaths until May 2nd. It is caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus and may lead to severe pulmonary infection and multi-organ failure. Past experiences show that unique characteristics in pregnancy make pregnant women more susceptible to complications from viral infections. Yet, this has not been reported with this new virus. There are risk factors that seem to increase morbidity in pregnancy, such as obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 35), asthma and cardiovascular disease. Current reports describe an increased rate of preterm birth and C-section. Vertical transmission is still a possibility, due to a few reported cases of neonatal positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasal swab, amniotic fluid, and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in neonatal blood. Treatments must be weighed in with caution due to the lack of quality trials that prove their effectiveness and safety during pregnancy.

This has provided insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and immune signaling circuits regulating antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and governing susceptibility and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. OBJECTIVES: In this review the current knowledge on IEIs underlying critical COVID-19 are presented, and the clinical implications of these findings for individualized prophylaxis and treatment are outlined. SOURCES: The review is based on a broad literature search, including primarily studies on whole exome sequencing, and to a lesser extent genome-wide association studies, of patients with critical COVID-19, as well as retrospective descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 disease course in individuals with known IEIs. CONTENT: The review describes the discovery of monogenic IEI in 9 genetic loci related to the production or responses to type I IFN in patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and the surprising finding of phenocopies of these, represented by neutralizing autoantibodies to type IFN in a significant proportion of patients with critical pneumonia, particularly in elderly men, and further enriched in patients with lethal disease course. Moreover insights gained from studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease course, and outcome in patients with known IEI is presented. Finally, some hypotheses for a possible genetic basis of autoimmune, inflammatory, and long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented and discussed. IMPLICATIONS: Uncovering IEI underlying critical COVID-19 or other severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations provide valuable insights into the basic principles of antiviral immune responses and pathophysiology related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such knowledge has important clinical implications for identification of susceptible individuals and for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of patients to reduce disease burden and improve preparedness against viral pandemics with known or emerging viruses in the future.","output":"Human genetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to present the authors' experience with technical recommendations for the treatment of concurrent large upper ureteral and renal stones. METHODS Between September 2014 and March 2016, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) ureterolithotomy with renal stone extraction or holmium laser lithotripsy under flexible cystoscopy was performed on 15 patients who had concurrent upper ureteral and renal stones. The ureteral stone was treated with LESS ureterolithotomy. After the ureteral stone had been removed, a flexible cystoscope was inserted through one of the laparoscopic ports into the renal pelvis and collecting systems. Renal stones were extracted with a stone basket or broken by a holmium laser and then removed. The perioperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of long-term side-effects. RESULTS Nine patients underwent LESS ureterolithotomy and flexible cystoscope-assisted renal stone extraction. Six patients underwent concomitant holmium laser lithotripsy because of larger renal stones. All procedures were completed successfully. The ureteral stones were 15-23 mm in diameter and the renal stones were 4-20 mm in diameter. The mean surgery time was 156 min. Estimated blood loss was 70 ml. Complete stone clearance was confirmed by postoperative imaging in all patients. The median length of hospital stay after surgery was 9.1 days. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred during a mean follow-up of 10.2 months. CONCLUSIONS LESS ureterolithotomy with renal stone extraction or holmium laser lithotripsy under flexible cystoscopy can be considered an effective treatment for patients with concurrent large ureteral and renal stones.","output":"Combined laparoendoscopic single-site ureterolithotomy and flexible cystoscopy in the treatment of concurrent large upper ureteral and renal stones."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G), a polymorphic non-classical HLA (HLA-Ib) with immune-regulatory properties in cancers and infectious diseases, presents both membrane-bound and soluble (sHLA-G) isoforms.

Differential expression patterns of HLA-G/sHLA-G or its polymorphism seem to be related to different pathological conditions, potentially acting as a disease progression biomarker. Pathogen antigens might be involved in the regulation of both membrane-bound and sHLA-G levels and impact immune responses during co-infections. The upregulation of HLA-G in viral and bacterial infections induce tolerance to infection. Recently, sHLA-G was found useful to identify the prognosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients and it was observed that the high levels of sHLA-G are associated with worse prognosis. The use of pathogens, such as Plasmodium falciparum, as immune modulators for other infections could be extended for the modulation of membrane-bound HLA-G in COVID-19-infected tissues. Overall, such information might open new avenues concerning the effect of some pathogens such as parasites in decreasing the expression level of HLA-G to restrict pathogenesis in some infections or to influence the immune responses after vaccination among others.","output":"Immunomodulatory Potential of Non-Classical HLA-G in Infections including COVID-19 and Parasitic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image processing is crucial in any image analysis to determine the problem.

Consequently, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (i.e. HbA1c >9). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes attending an outpatient integrated care clinic. The study consisted of two arms, namely a telemedicine care model and a traditional care model with 100 patients in each. The clinical effectiveness (i.e. reduction in HbA1c) and the total cost in both arms were determined, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. This study adopted propensity score matching. RESULTS: The patients in the telemedicine care model had a mean reduction in their HbA1c level of 1.82 (95% CI = 1.56C2.09, p < 0.001), while those in the traditional care model had a mean reduction of 1.54 (95% CI = 1.23C1.85, p < 0.001). Consequently, the incremental effect was 0.28 (95% CI = ?0.194 to 0.546). The mean total costs were SAR 4819.76 (US$1285.27) and SAR 4150.69 (US$1106.85) for patients in the telemedicine and traditional care models, respectively. Consequently, the incremental cost was SAR 669.07 (US$178.42) [95% CI = SAR 593.7 (US$158.32)CSAR 1013.64 (US$270.30)]. The ICER was estimated to be SAR 2372.52 (US$632.67) per 1% reduction in the level of HbA1c. Moreover, the telemedicine care model resulted in a higher cost and better outcome (i.e. reduction in the HbA1c level) with an 81.80% confidence level. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine care is cost-effective in managing type 2 patients with poorly controlled diabetes. Consequently, we believe that telemedicine care can be further expanded and incorporated into routine diabetes care.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of telemedicine care for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a novel method to exploit chirality of highly sensitive graphene plasmonic metasurfaces to characterize complex refractive indexes (RI) of viruses by detecting the polarization state of the reflected electric fields in the THz spectrum. A dispersive graphene metasurface is designed to produce chiral surface currents to couple linearly polarized incident fields to circularly polarized reflected fields. The metasurface sensing sensitivity is the result of surface plasmon currents that flow in a chiral fashion with strong intensity due to the underlying geometrical resonance. Consequently, unique polarization states are observed in the far-field with the ellipticity values that change rapidly with the analytes RI. The determination of bimolecular RI is treated as an inverse problem in which the polarization states of the virus is compared with a pre-calculated calibration model that is obtained by full-wave electromagnetic simulations. We demonstrate the polarization selective sensing method by RI discrimination of three different types of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses including H1N1, H5N2, and H9N2 is possible. Since the proposed virus characterization method only requires determination of the polarization ellipses including its orientation at monochromatic frequency, the required instrumentation is simpler compared to traditional spectroscopic methods which need a broadband frequency scan.","output":"A THz graphene metasurface for polarization selective virus sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral drug resistance is believed to be less likely to occur if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins. In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of a crucial viral replication factor, namely, importin-7, as a cellular drug target to combat pandemic influenza viruses. Surprisingly, only five viral lung-to-lung passages were required to achieve 100% lethality in importin-7?/? mice that otherwise are resistant. Viral escape from importin-7 requirement was mediated by five mutations in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins. Moreover, the importin-7?/? mouse-adapted strain became even more virulent for wild-type mice than the parental strain. These studies show that targeting host proteins may still result in viral escape by alternative pathways, eventually giving rise to even more virulent virus strains. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach to reduce viral drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Here, we investigated the long-standing hypothesis based on in vitro studies that viral drug resistance occurrence is less likely if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins. Here, we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing, in an in vivo animal model, the feasibility of targeting the cellular factor importin-7, which is crucial for human influenza virus replication and pathogenesis, as an efficient antiviral strategy against pandemic influenza viruses. In summary, our studies suggest that resistance against cellular factors is possible in vivo, and the emergence of even more virulent viral escape variants calls for particular caution. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach using compounds against viral as well as cellular factors to reduce the risk of viral drug resistance and potentially increased virulence.","output":"Targeting Importin-7 as a Therapeutic Approach against Pandemic Influenza Viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aims to assess how different urbanisation patterns related to rapid urban growth, unplanned expansion, and human population density affect the establishment and distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and create favourable conditions for the spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following: human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the studys limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely Aedes ecology and transmission dynamics. There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies.

Bacteria can form biofilms on implant surfaces, making them more difficult to detect and treat. Since standard antibiotic therapy is often impaired in biofilm infections, particular interest is directed towards finding treatment alternatives. Biofilm-formation is a well-organized process during which bacteria communicate via quorum-sensing molecules (QSM). The aim of this study was to inhibit bacterial communication by directing avian IgY against specific QSM. Methods: Chicken were immunized against the following QSM: (1) AtlE, a member of the autolysin family which mediates attachment to a surface in Staphylococcus epidermidis; (2) GroEL, the bacterial heat shock protein; (3) PIA (polysaccharide intercellular adhesion), which is essential for cell-cell adhesion in biofilms. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were grown and inhibition of biofilm-formation by IgYs was evaluated. Additionally, human osteoblasts were cultivated and biocompatibility of IgYs was tested. Results: We were able to demonstrate that all IgYs reduced biofilm-formation, also without prior immunization. Therefore, the response was probably not specific with regard to the QSM. Osteoblasts were activated by all IgYs which was demonstrated by microscopy and an increased release of IL-8.

ICU-acquired weakness increases risk of in-ICU, in-hospital and long-term mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and of hospitalization and augments healthcare-related costs, increases likelihood of prolonged care in rehabilitation centers and reduces physical function and quality of life in the long term. RCTs have shown preventive impact of avoiding hyperglycemia, of omitting early parenteral nutrition use and of minimizing sedation. Results of studies investigating the impact of early mobilization, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and of pharmacological interventions were inconsistent, with recent systematic reviews/meta-analyses revealing no or only low-quality evidence for benefit. ICU-acquired weakness predisposes to adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Only a few preventive, but no therapeutic, strategies exist. Further mechanistic research is needed to identify new targets for interventions to be tested in adequately powered RCTs.","output":"ICU-acquired weakness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the United Nations, about 1 billion persons live in so-called slums. Numerous studies have shown that this population is particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emphatically underlines this problem. The often high-density living quarters coupled with a large number of persons per dwelling and the lack of adequate sanitation are reasons why measures to contain the pandemic only work to a limited extent in slums. Furthermore, assignment to risk groups for severe courses of COVID-19 caused by noncommunicable diseases (eg, cardiovascular diseases) is not possible due to inadequate data availability. Information on people living in slums and their health status is either unavailable or only exists for specific regions (eg, Nairobi). We argue that one of the greatest problems with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of slums in the Global South is the lack of data on the number of people, their living conditions, and their health status.","output":"COVID-19 and Slums: A Pandemic Highlights Gaps in Knowledge About Urban Poverty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection has now evolved into a worldwide crisis that triggers substantial morbidity and mortality.

We hypothesized that in organs such as the ileum, which co-express 11betaHSD2, MR and ACE2, the expression of ACE2 would be suppressed. We studied organ tissues from an experiment originally designed to address the effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra extract on stress response. Male Sprague Dawley rats were left undisturbed or exposed to chronic mild stress for five weeks. For the last two weeks, animals continued with a placebo diet or received a diet containing extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra root at a dose of 150 mg/kg of body weight/day. Quantitative PCR measurements showed a significant decrease in gene expression of ACE2 in the small intestine of rats fed with diet containing Glycyrrhiza glabra extract. This effect was independent of the stress condition and failed to be observed in non-target tissues, namely the heart and the brain cortex. In the small intestine we also confirmed the reduction of ACE2 at the protein level. Present findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that Glycyrrhiza glabra extract may reduce an entry point of SARS-CoV-2. Whether this phenomenon, when confirmed in additional studies, is linked to the susceptibility of cells to the virus requires further studies.","output":"Food Enrichment with Glycyrrhiza glabra Extract Suppresses ACE2 mRNA and Protein Expression in RatsPossible Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human adenovirus 7 (HAdV-7) strains are a major cause of acute respiratory disease (ARD) among adults and children, associated with fatal pneumonia.

To better understand the underlying cause of this large-scale epidemic, virus strains were isolated from infected patients and sequence variations of the whole genome sequence were detected. Evolutionary trees and alignment results indicated that the major capsid protein genes hexon and fibre were strongly conserved among serotype 7 strains in China at that time. Instead, the HAdV-7 strains presented three thymine deletions in the virus associated RNA (VA RNA) II terminal region. We also found that the mutation might lead to increased mRNA expression of an adjacent gene, L1 52/55K, and thus promoted faster growth. These findings suggest that sequence variation of VA RNA II gene was a potential cause of such a severe HAdV-7 infection and this gene should be a new-emerging factor to be monitored for better understanding of HAdV-7 infection.","output":"An outbreak of acute respiratory disease caused by a virus associated RNA II gene mutation strain of human adenovirus 7 in China, 2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adherence to measures that have been adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to control the spread of the coronavirus. Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were performed with 99 patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) and 21 controls to explore knowledge, attitudes, practices, and burden in order to elucidate nonadherence to preventive measures. Results: The majority of patients understood the preventive measures and felt sufficiently informed. Analysis of qualitative answers, however, showed that about 30% of patients had an insufficient level of knowledge, which was not associated with educational level, cognitive disorders, or depression. Changes in behaviour were reported by 73 patients (99% performed at least one specific preventive behavior, and 86.9% have reduced social contacts and stayed home). A closer analysis of qualitative answers showed that 27.3% of patients continued to meet relatives face-to-face almost daily. Anxiety and worries about the current situation were reported by 58.6% of patients; 31.3% complained about a decrease in their mobility since the beginning of the restrictions, mainly because of worsening of PD and because regular therapies (e.g., physiotherapy) were canceled.

The third major cause of mortality in the United States, following heart disease and cancer in 2020, was undoubtedly COVID-19. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) and the world health organization (WHO) separately developed a categorization system for differentiating new strains of SARS-CoV-2 into variants of concern (VoCs) and variants of interest (VoIs) with the continuing development of various strains SARS-CoV-2. By December 2021, five of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs were discovered from the onset of the pandemic depending on the latest epidemiologic report by the WHO: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and n-terminal domain (NTD) have been found throughout all five identified VoCs. All strains other than the delta mutant are often found with the N501Y mutation situated on the RBD, resulting in higher binding between the spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, enhanced viral adhesion, and following the entrance to host cells.

We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the risk-benefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01-46%).

METHODS A survey to assess attitudes towards sharing of personal health information through a provincial EHR was conducted with a convenience sample of clients attending an STI clinic in Vancouver. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine the association between the primary outcome variable, whether a client would be less likely to take the test for an STI or HIV if their clinic records were made part of a provincial EHR, and independent variables of interest. RESULTS A total of 1004 clients completed the survey, and 31% stated that they would be less likely to get tested for STI/HIV if their records were made part of a provincial EHR. Participants who were more likely to agree that they might avoid testing had the expectation that no other clinician would review their chart (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.55), or expected their records would not be shared beyond the clinic (AOR=2.81). DISCUSSION While most participants thought an EHR was acceptable, a large minority expressed that they might avoid testing if their records were made part of a provincial EHR.

In 2020, the German Society for Prevention&Rehabilitation and the German Society for Cardiology requested establishing dedicated HF training groups. Here, we aimed to implement and evaluate the feasibility and safety of one of the first HF training groups in Germany. METHODS: Twelve patients (three women) with symptomatic HF (NYHA class II/III) and an ejection fraction  45% participated and were offered weekly, physician-supervised exercise training for 1 year. Patients received a wrist-worn pedometer (M430 Polar) and underwent the following assessments at baseline and after 4, 8 and 12 months: cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6-min walk test, echocardiography (blinded reading), and quality of life assessment (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, KCCQ). RESULTS: All patients (median age [quartiles] 64 [49; 64] years) completed the study and participated in 76% of the offered 36 training sessions. The pedometer was worn  1000 min per day over 86% of the time. No cardiovascular events occurred during training. Across 12 months, NT-proBNP dropped from 986 pg/ml [455; 1937] to 483 pg/ml [247; 2322], and LVEF increased from 36% [29;41] to 41% [32;46]%, (p for trend = 0.01).

While household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common, risk factors for HHC transmission are poorly understood. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 37 households with at least one reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed (RT-PCR) COVID-19 index case from March 2020 - March 2021, in order to calculate secondary attack rates (SAR) and define risk factors for secondary infections. Participants were tested daily for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR, using self-collected lower nasal samples. Households were followed until all members tested negative for seven consecutive days. We collected demographics, medical conditions, relationship to index case, and socioeconomic indicators. Subgroup data analysis was conducted and stratified by positivity status. RESULTS: Of 99 enrolled participants, 37 were index cases and 62 were household contacts (HHC), of whom 25 HHC were infected (40.3%). Secondary attack rate (SAR) was highest among adults caring for a parent (n=4/4, 100%) and parents of index cases (5/10, 50%). Households whose income came from service work had greater risk of transmission compared to households whose primary income was technology (n=5/7; 71.4% vs 3/8; 37.5% respectively). Pediatric contacts were at lower risk of infection when compared to adult contacts (n=5/18, 27.8% vs n=20/44, 45.5% respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that household transmission represents a key source of community-based infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Analysis of focus group sessions and couples interviews distinguished between experiences related to the pandemic and those related to resulting governmental restrictions (e.g., lockdown, social distancing). We theoretically framed our findings in terms of the dual processes of orienting to loss versus restoring life, reconstructing meaning in bereavement, and relationally attuning as a couple to a shared loss. We found that the COVID period accentuated all losses, awakening the parents' grief for their own loss and their empathy for others. At the same time, they experienced limited opportunities for restoration-oriented distraction through connection with familiar activities and relationships beyond the family. Control or choice in this process of oscillation between orienting to grief versus ongoing life was impaired by the pandemic, as parents struggled to find a new dynamic balance to compensate for the risk of continuous engagement with reminders of their loss. Most notable was their close proximity as a couple, while being at a greater distance from the social network. The continuous attunement process between partners and family members played out in a process of drawing close and interposing distance, of grieving apart and together, of talking about grief and holding silence.

Objectives Examine the stability and change in internet and offline gaming and the association with physical inactivity among adolescents in Norway during the pandemic. Methods A total of 2940 youth (58% girls) aged 12C19 years participated in an online longitudinal two-wave survey during the first Norwegian national lockdown in April 2020 (t1) and in December 2020 (t2). Gaming behavior and physical activity status were assessed at both time points. Age, gender, and socioeconomic status were included as covariates. Results Among boys, 41% reported gaming a lot more and 35% a little more at t1 compared to before the national lockdown. The corresponding numbers for girls were 14 and 23%, respectively. In fully adjusted analysis, a pattern of increased gaming at t1 followed by an additional increase in gaming reported at t2 was associated with physical inactivity at t1 (OR = 2.10, p < 0.01) and t2 (OR = 2.45, p < 0.001). Participants gaming more at t1 followed by a reduction at t2 had higher odds of inactivity at t1 (OR = 1.88, p < 0.01). Youth reporting no gaming at t1 had lower odds for inactivity at this time point (OR = 0.67, p < 0.05). Conclusions Increased gaming among many youths and a relationship with physical inactivity was observed during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. To counteract the negative long-term impacts of COVID-19 restrictions, public health initiatives should emphasize the facilitation of physical activity in youth and develop effective strategies to prevent problematic gaming.","output":"Increased Gaming During COVID-19 Predicts Physical Inactivity Among Youth in NorwayA Two-Wave Longitudinal Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amongst the 60 viral species reported to be associated with bats, 59 are RNA viruses, which are potentially important in the generation of emerging and re\\\\emerging infections in humans.

The skin is widely considered the first-line defence of the body, with an essential function in rejecting pathogens and preventing mechanical, chemical, and physical damages. Keratinocytes are the predominant cells of the outer skin layer, the epidermis, which acts as a mechanical and water-permeability barrier. The epidermis is a permanently renewed tissue where undifferentiated keratinocytes located at the basal layer proliferate and migrate to the overlying layers. During this migration process, keratinocytes undertake a differentiation program known as keratinization process. Dysregulation of this differentiation process can result in a series of skin disorders. In this context, aquaporins (AQPs), a family of membrane channel proteins allowing the movement of water and small neutral solutes, are emerging as important players in skin physiology and skin diseases. Here, we review the role of AQPs in skin keratinization, hydration, keratinocytes proliferation, water retention, barrier repair, wound healing, and immune response activation.

However, it remains unclear, how these results should be interpreted. We aimed to analyze whether on-treatment HCV RNA levels predict relapse comparing the CobasAmpliPrep/CobasTaqMan v2.0 (CAP/CTM) and Abbott RealTime HCV (ART) assays. METHODS Samples were collected from 298 patients (HCV genotypes; GT1-5) at weeks (w) 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 during SOF-based therapy at two university clinics and tested for HCV RNA level by CAP/CTM and ART. Patients were treated with SOF/ribavirin (RBV) 12/24 w (n=99), pegylated-interferon-alfa (PegIFN)/SOF/RBV 12 w (n=51), SOF/simeprevir (SMV)RBV 12 w (n=69) or SOF/daclatasvirRBV 12/24 w (n=79). RESULTS HCV RNA levels during the first 4weeks of SOF/RBV therapy were significantly lower in GT3 patients who achieved SVR compared with those who relapsed. All GT3 patients with a week 2 result <45IU/ml by CAP/CTM achieved SVR but only 33% of those with ?45IU/ml (p=0.0003). Similar results were documented with ART and 60IU/ml as cut-off (SVR: 100% vs. 29%; p=0.0002). In contrast, HCV RNA levels during early treatment phases were not significantly related to relapse in patients treated with other SOF-based regimens. Residual HCV RNA was frequently detected by ART at later stages of therapy. However, SVR rates remained high in these patients. At the end of SOF/SMVRBV therapy HCV RNA was detectable with ART in 20% of patients, of whom 92% achieved SVR. CONCLUSIONS HCV RNA levels assessed at week 2 of SOF/RBV therapy can predict relapse in GT3-patients. Detectable HCV RNA results at later stages during SOF-based therapy may occur frequently with the more sensitive ART. However, this should not lead to treatment extension. LAY SUMMARY We analyzed the predictive value of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels measured at different time points for treatment efficacy. We found that the level of HCV RNA measured at week 2 of antiviral therapy can be used to predict treatment success in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin but not in patients treated with other sofosbuvir-based regimens. Low level HCV RNA is frequently detected by the RealTime HCV assay during later stages of antiviral therapy. However, this is not associated with reoccurrence of HCV RNA after the end of treatment.","output":"Clinical value of on-treatment HCV RNA levels during different sofosbuvir-based antiviral regimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Treating COVID-19 patients can affect anxiety.

The direct comparison of the software performance with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the feasibility, accuracy, and reproducibility of a fully automated RV quantification software against CMR imaging as a reference. Methods: A total of 170 patients who underwent both CMR and three-dimensional echocardiography were enrolled. RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), RV end-systolic volume (RVESV), and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) were obtained using fully automated three-dimensional RV quantification software and compared with a CMR reference. For inter-technical agreement, Spearman correlation and BlandCAltman analysis were used. Results: The fully automated RV quantification software was feasible in 149 patients. RVEDV and RVESV were underestimated, and RVEF was overestimated compared with CMR values. RV measurements obtained from the manual editing method correlated better with CMR values than that without manual editing (RVEDV, 0.924 vs. 0.794: RVESV, 0.955 vs. 0.854; RVEF, 0.941 vs. 0.781 respectively, all p < 0.0001) with less bias and narrower limit of agreement (LOA). The bias and LOA for RV volumes and EF using the automated software without and with manual editing were greater in patients with severely impaired RV function or low frame rate than those with normal and mild impaired RV function, or high frame rate. The fully automated RV three-dimensional measurements were highly reproducible. Conclusion: The novel fully automated RV software shows good feasibility and reproducibility, and the measurements had a high correlation with CMR values.

METHODS Data from three clinical studies with measured tracheal lengths were pooled in a database including 422 children aged from birth to 16 yr. Dimensional data of seven cuffed paediatric tracheal tube brands (ID 3.0-7.0 mm) were recorded. Positions of tracheal tube tip and upper cuff border were calculated for each of the 422 tracheas using depth mark based tracheal tube placement, placement of the tracheal tube tip at a calculated safety distance above the carina, and mid-tracheal tube placement. Percentage of accidental bronchial intubations and tracheal tube cuff positions in the subglottic or supraglottic region were calculated. RESULTS Depth mark based tracheal tube placement resulted in accidental bronchial intubation of up to 18% of cases and tracheal tube cuffs being placed in the subglottic region in up to 91%. Tracheal tube tip placement at a calculated safety distance resulted in up to 54% of tube cuffs placed too high. Mid-tracheal tube placement led to 100% subglottic or supraglottic tracheal tube cuff positions. CONCLUSIONS All studied cuffed paediatric tracheal tubes have major design flaws potentially leading to airway complications.

The Shock Index (SI: heart rate/systolic blood pressure) proved useful in detecting hemodynamic instability in sepsis and myocardial infarction patients. In this study we aim to determine whether SI is discriminative for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, single-center study. All patients 18 years old who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (defined as: positive result on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included for analysis. Data were collected from electronic medical patient records and stored in a protected database. ED shock index was calculated and analyzed for its discriminative value on in-hospital mortality and ICU admission by a ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: In total, 411 patients were included. Of all patients 249 (61%) were male. ICU admission was observed in 92 patients (22%). Of these, 37 patients (40%) died in the ICU. Total in-hospital mortality was 28% (114 patients). For in-hospital mortality the optimal cut-off SI  0.86 was not discriminative (AUC 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43C0.56)), with a sensitivity of 12.3% and specificity of 93.6%. For ICU admission the optimal cut-off SI  0.57 was also not discriminative (AUC 0.56 (95% CI: 0.49C0.62)), with a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 34.2%.

The lower lifetime of polycrystalline PV modules combined with their lower efficiency is found to severely downgrade their environmental performance vis--vis monocrystalline PV modules. The end-of-life treatment of the projected 6,576 tonnes of solar PV waste, expected to be accumulated between 2034-59, indicates a recovery rate of 90.7% entailing electricity consumption, GHG emissions, and monetary cost of 678.6 MWh, 648 tonnes of CO2 eq., and USD 11.8 billion, respectively.

NEUROPSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS: The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as long Covid, is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY OF COVID-19: Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. ROLE OF PSYCHIATRIST: Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. MANAGEMENT: The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.","output":"Neuropsychiatric Aspects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China. Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. Results: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO2&gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO2 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1C2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25C29) vs. 23 (22C25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO2/FiO2significantly improved after 1C2 h of NIV [median 172 (150C208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79C130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). Conclusions: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO2were more likely to experience HFNC failure.","output":"The experience of high-flow nasal cannula in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in two hospitals of Chongqing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 spread and identification of variants in sewers has been demonstrated to accurately detect prevalence of viral strains and is advantageous to clinical sampling in population catchment size.

Viral sequences obtained from the wastewater samples had high coverages of the genome, and mutation analyses successfully identified the penetration of the B.1.1.7 variant into Israel in December 2020 in the central and north regions, and its spread into additional regions in January and February 2021, corresponding with clinical sampling results. Moreover, the wastewater analysis identified the B.1.1.7 variant in December 2020 in regions in which non-sufficient clinical sampling was available.

The other two groups received cb-TENS at 20 Hz (20 Hz group) or 40 Hz (40 Hz group). Cb-TENS was administered daily for seven days and then twice a week for three weeks thereafter. To assess the recovery of facial function, whisker movement was monitored for four weeks. Histopathological evaluation of nerve regeneration was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal microscopy with immunofluorescence (IF) staining. In addition, the levels of various molecular biological markers that affect nerve regeneration were analyzed. Whisker movement in the cb-TENS groups showed faster and better recovery than the control group. The 40 Hz group showed significantly better movement at the first week after injury (p < 0.0125). In histopathological analyses using TEM, nerve axons and Schwann cells, which were destroyed immediately after the injury, recovered in all groups over time. However, the regeneration of the myelin sheath was remarkably rapid and thicker in the 20 Hz and 40 Hz groups than in the control group. Image analysis using IF staining showed that the expression levels of S100B and NF200 increased over time in all groups. Specifically, the expression of NF200 in the 20 Hz and 40 Hz groups increased markedly compared to the control group. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on ten representative neurotrophic factors, and the levels of IL-1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in the 20 and 40 Hz groups than in the control group (p < 0.015).

This is of concern in Guatemala where physicians seldom consider guidance from other professionals during antimicrobial prescribing activities. Methods We carried out a cross sectional questionnaire and open ended interviews with physicians from five hospitals in Guatemala to describe perceptions of communication between health care providers, and acceptance of antimicrobial guidance during prescribing. Results From January to April 2021 an electronic questionnaire was sent to enrolled physicians of which 74% completed participation (n=107/145). Fifty-five percent participated in open ended interviews (n=79/145). Respondents perceived high levels of communication between physicians and ID specialists (94% of respondents);52%, and 54% perceived high levels of physician-pharmacist, and physician-nurse communication respectively. Significant differences in the perception of physician-pharmacist communication were detected when comparing responses between hospitals, and between respondent sex (chi2, p< 0.05). Barriers to communication between professionals included lack of local guidelines or protocols, patient overload, COVID-19 pandemic, lack of mentorship, and little room to discuss antimicrobial therapy with higher-ranking physicians. Eighty percent and 45% of physicians were open to receiving antibiotic optimization recommendations from other physicians, and pharmacists respectively. Notable barriers to accepting recommendations from pharmacists included lack of regular communication, lack of clinical experience, and concern about evidence based recommendations. Conclusion Effective communication is perceived between physicians during antimicrobial prescribing activities.

Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1. CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments. CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation. Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain. Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.","output":"Cicadidae Periostracum, the Cast-Off Skin of Cicada, Protects Dopaminergic Neurons in a Model of Parkinson's Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call on the zoonotic viral spillover events and the need to be prepared for future outbreaks.

In previous work we developed a model of social distancing driven by individuals' risk attitude, a parameter which determines the extent to which social contacts are reduced in response to a given infection level. We showed by simulation that a strong response, driven by a highly cautious risk attitude, can quickly suppress an epidemic. However, a moderately cautious risk attitude gives weak control and, by prolonging the epidemic without reducing its impact, may yield a worse outcome than doing nothing. In real societies, social distancing may arise spontaneously from individual choices rather than being imposed centrally. There is little data available about this as opportunistic data collection during epidemics is difficult. Our study uses a simulated epidemic in a computer game setting to measure the social distancing response. METHODS Two hundred thirty participants played a computer game simulating an epidemic on a spatial network. The player controls one individual in a population of 2500 (with others controlled by computer) and decides how many others to contact each day. To mimic real-world trade-offs, the player is motivated to make contact by being rewarded with points, while simultaneously being deterred by the threat of infection. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding psychological measures of health protection motivation. Finally, simulations were used to compare the experimentally-observed response to epidemics with no response. RESULTS Participants reduced contacts in response to infection in a manner consistent with our model of social distancing. The experimentally observed response was too weak to halt epidemics quickly, resulting in a somewhat reduced attack rate and a substantially reduced peak attack rate, but longer duration and fewer social contacts, compared to no response. Little correlation was observed between participants' risk attitudes and the psychological measures. CONCLUSIONS Our cognitive model of social distancing matches responses to a simulated epidemic. If these responses indicate real world behaviour, spontaneous social distancing can be expected to reduce peak attack rates. However, additional measures are needed if it is important to stop an epidemic quickly.","output":"Spontaneous social distancing in response to a simulated epidemic: a virtual experiment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of pandemic, COVID-19, recognition of masked face images is a challenging problem, as most of the facial components become invisible.

Consequently, online consultations have gained popularity. Aim: To explore patient perceptions regarding virtual consultations. Methods: A voluntary online survey using a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions was administered to patients across selected cities in India using a social media platform. Responses were used to explore the characteristics of users, perceived advantages and disadvantages of online consultations and patient satisfaction. Results: There were 679 respondents (M 52.4%: F 47.6%) that had consulted doctors online;91.8% were from 8 major metro cities. Interestingly, over 80% had never sought online consultation before the COVID-19 pandemic. 46% consultations were via videocalls, 26% through WhatsApp and 21% via telephone calls. The main advantages of online consultations cited by patients included a lower risk of infection (78.8%), reduced waiting time (56.8%) and travel time (58.3%). The main disadvantages included a lack of physical examination (73.4%), a perception that this was not as satisfying as a face-to face consultation (37.9%) and difficulty in communication (24.5%). 78.6% patients rated their online consultations as either good or very good. However, given the choice, almost two-thirds felt they would still prefer face-face consultations. Conclusion: High levels of satisfaction from this survey suggests that teleconsultation has the potential to become a complementary method to access clinical care even after restrictions from the pandemic cease.

In decedents, median survival from Hospitalization was 6 (IQR: 3-10) days. 264 decedents had 1 RF, 120 had 2 RFs and 39 had &#8805;3 RFs. At multivariate logistic regression model, variables associated with primary outcome were: age class (64-69 years) (OR 3.03, CI 1.75-5.31, p<0.001), age class (70-88 years) (OR 10.08, CI 6.67-15.72, p<0.001), age class (&#8805; 88 years) (OR 23.99, CI 13.21-44.82, p<0.001), male gender (OR 1.88, CI 1.36-2.62, p<0.001), diabetes (OR 1.56, CI 1.07-2.26, p=0.02), stroke (OR 3.41, CI 1.33-9.91, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Age, male gender, presence of diabetes and stroke appeared as independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

This study describes a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and corresponding reported symptomatology at a shelter in Toronto. METHODS This clinical and epidemiologic analysis focuses on a COVID-19 outbreak at a dedicated refugee shelter in downtown Toronto. All adult residents on site at the shelter were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing on Apr. 20, 2020. At the time of testing, residents were screened for 3 typical COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath). Among those who tested positive, a more comprehensive clinical assessment was conducted 1 day after testing and a standardized 15-item symptom screen was administered by telephone 14 days after testing. We report rates of positive test results and clinical symptoms with each assessment interval. RESULTS Of the 63 adult residents on site at the shelter, 60 agreed to be tested. Among those tested, 41.7% (n = 25) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those who tested positive (n = 25), 20.0% (n = 5) reported fever, cough or shortness of breath at the time of testing. On more detailed assessment 1 day later, 70.8% (17/24) reported a broader range of symptoms. During the 14 days after testing, 87.5% (21/24) reported symptoms of infection. INTERPRETATION We found a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this shelter population. Our study underscores the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in congregate living settings and the importance of mobilizing timely testing and management of symptomatic, paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic residents in shelters.","output":"Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection at a large refugee shelter in Toronto, April 2020: a clinical and epidemiologic descriptive analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To estimate the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against Confirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths. To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern. Design Test negative case control design Setting Community COVID-19 PCR testing in England Participants All adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million). All COVID-19 testing in the community among eligible individuals who reported symptoms between 8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021 was included in the analysis. Interventions One and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine. Main outcome measures Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. Results Individuals aged >=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen. Individuals aged >=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19. Conclusion Vaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.","output":"Early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccine on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and mortality in older adults in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corynebacterium accounts for around 20% of the armpit microbiome and plays an essential role in axillary osmidrosis (AO). In this study, the effects of Lactobacillus bulgaricus treatment on the microecological environment of armpits and its efficacy in the treatment of AO were investigated. A total of 10 AO patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were treated with L. bulgaricus mixed with saline on the left armpit (experimental group) and pure saline on the right armpit (control group) for 28 days. After treatment, AO severity showed a significant decrease (p = 0.013) in the experimental group compared with the control group, and the Corynebacterium abundance also showed a corresponding significant decrease (p < 0.01). Moreover, no significant variation in Staphylococcus abundance was found between these two groups. The microbe diversity is not disturbed in the treatment. Accordingly, our study demonstrates that L. bulgaricus can serve as an effective probiotic microbe for AO treatment by reducing the abundance of Corynebacterium and rebalancing the microecological environment.","output":"Treatment of Axillary Osmidrosis by Rebalancing Skin Microecology With Lactobacillus bulgaricus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims to analyze the effects of indoor activities such as physical exercise, digital socializing, and digital gaming on the subjective wellbeing levels of individuals.

For a variety of purposes, it is essential to understand the fundamental structural properties of graphene. Molecular descriptors were used in this study to investigate graphene sheets structural behaviour. Based on our findings, reverse degree-based molecular descriptors can significantly affect the exchange-correlation energy prediction. For the exchange-correlation energy of graphene sheets, a linear regression analysis was conducted using the reverse general inverse sum indeg descriptor, [Formula: see text]. From [Formula: see text] , a set of reverse topological descriptors can be obtained all at once as a special case, resulting in a model with a high correlation coefficient (R between 0.896 and 0.998). Used together, these reverse descriptors are graphed in relation to their response to graphene.

Some of the widely used serological testing techniques are enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). However, these tests are plagued with low sensitivity or specificity, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. We developed a serological test implementing flow-through dot-blot assay (FT-DBA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG detection, which provides enhanced sensitivity and specificity while being quick to perform and easy to use. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane to capture human IgG, which was then detected with anti-human IgG conjugated gold nanoparticle (hIgG-AuNP). A total of 181 samples were analyzed in-house. Within which 35 were further evaluated in US FDA-approved CLIA Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 assay. The positive panel consisted of RT-qPCR positive samples from patients with both <14 days and >14 days from the onset of clinical symptoms. The negative panel contained samples collected from the pre-pandemic era dengue patients and healthy donors during the pandemic. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FT-DBA were evaluated against RT-qPCR positive sera. However, the overall efficacies were assessed with sera that seroconverted against either nucleocapsid (NCP) or receptor-binding domain (RBD). RESULTS: In-house ELISA selected a total of 81 true seropositive and 100 seronegative samples. The sensitivity of samples with <14 days using FT-DBA was 94.7%, increasing to 100% for samples >14 days. The overall detection sensitivity and specificity were 98.8% and 98%, respectively, whereas the overall PPV and NPV were 99.6% and 99%. Moreover, comparative analysis between in-house ELISA assays and FT-DBA revealed clinical agreement of Cohens Kappa value of 0.944. The FT-DBA showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% when compared with commercial CLIA kits. CONCLUSION: The assay can confirm past SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy within 2 minutes compared to commercial CLIA or in-house ELISA. It can help track SARS-CoV-2 disease progression, population screening, and vaccination response. The ease of use of the assay without requiring any instruments while being semi-quantitative provides the avenue of its implementation in remote areas around the globe, where conventional serodiagnosis is not feasible.","output":"AuNP Coupled Rapid Flow-Through Dot-Blot Immuno-Assay for Enhanced Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Nucleocapsid and Receptor Binding Domain IgG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mesenteric traction syndrome is commonly observed in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery and is associated with severe postoperative complications. A triad of hypotension, tachycardia, and facial flushing seems provoked by prostacyclin (PGI2) release from the gut in response to mesenteric traction. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibits PGI2 release, stabilizing the hemodynamic response. Here, we examined the effect of mesenteric traction on splanchnic blood flow in pigs randomized to NSAID or placebo treatment. Materials and Methods Twenty pigs were allocated to either ketorolac or placebo treatment. Five minutes of manual mesenteric traction was applied. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1, a stable metabolite of PGI2, hemodynamic variables, and regional blood flow (laser speckle contrast imaging) to the liver, stomach, small intestine, upper lip, and snout (laser Doppler flowmetry) were recorded prior to traction and 5 and 30 minutes thereafter. Results Both groups of pigs presented a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P = .01), mean arterial blood pressure (P = .001), and blood flow in the gastric antrum (P = .002). Plasma 6-keto-PGF1 did not increase in either group (P = .195), and cardiac output, heart rate, central venous pressure, and blood flow to the liver, small intestine, upper lip, and snout remained unchanged. Conclusion Mesenteric traction resulted in cardiovascular depression, including reduced blood flow in the gastric antrum. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1 did not increase, and ketorolac administration did not alter the response to mesenteric traction.

Adapting to crisis conditions requires a rethink of traditional best practices in surgical management, delving into an area of unknown risk profiles. Key challenging areas include cancelling elective operations, modifying procedures to adapt local services and updating the consenting process. We aim to provide an ethical rationale to support change in practice and guide future decision-making. Using the four principles approach as a structure, Medline was searched for existing ethical frameworks aimed at resolving conflicting moral duties. Where insufficient data were available, best guidance was sought from educational institutions: National Health Service England and The Royal College of Surgeons. Multiple papers presenting high-quality, reasoned, ethical theory and practice guidance were collected. Using this as a basis to assess current practice, multiple requirements were generated to ensure preservation of ethical integrity when making management decisions. Careful consideration of ethical principles must guide production of local guidance ensuring consistent patient selection thus preserving equality as well as quality of clinical services. A critical issue is balancing the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19 and its associated complications. As such, the need for surgery must be sufficiently pressing to proceed with conventional or non-conventional operative management; otherwise, delaying intervention is justified.

Similar models are also proposed to describe the spread of riots and, more generally, of collective behaviors in various social contexts. The use of epidemiology models to describe such social phenomena is based on the analogy between the mechanisms of contagion and social imitation. In turn, this analogy also points to the social nature of epidemics. This paper is concerned with a family of Reaction-Diffusion systems introduced in [17] that aims at unifying, generalizing, and enlarging the fields of application for epidemiology and collective behavior models. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach on these apparently various phenomena through the example of the dynamics of social unrest. The model involves two quantities, the level of social unrest, or, more general, activity u, and a field of social tension v, which play asymmetric roles: u is thought of as the actual observed or explicit quantity while v is an ambiant, sometimes implicit field of susceptibility that modulates the growth of u. In this article, we explore this class of model and prove several theoretical results based on the framework developed in [17], of which the present work is a companion paper. Here we place the emphasis on two subclasses of systems defined in [17]: tension inhibiting and tension enhancing. These are characterized by the fact that the unrest has respectively a negative or positive feedback on the social tension (though no monotonicity condition is assumed). In [17] we derive a threshold phenomenon in terms of the initial level of social tension: below a critical value, a small triggering event is quickly followed by a resumption of calm, while, above this value, it generates an eruption of social unrest spreading through space with an asymptotically constant speed. The new results we derive in the present paper concern the behavior of the solution far from the propagating edge, that is, we give a description of the new regime of the system following the initial surge of activity. We show in particular that the model can give rise to many diverse qualitative dynamics: ephemeral or limited-duration social movements-referred to as\\"riots\\"-in the tension inhibiting case, and persisting social movements-lasting upheavals-in the tension enhancing case, as well as other more complex behaviors in some mixed cases. We also investigate this model by numerical simulations that highlight the richness of this framework. We finally propose and study extensions of the model, such as spatially heterogeneous systems.","output":"Modeling propagation of epidemics, social unrest and other collective behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes, while retinal endothelial cell (REC) dysfunction is considered the primary pathological process of DR. Naringenin, a natural flavonoid compound, exhibits therapeutic potential against multiple types of endothelial cell injury. To the best of our knowledge, however, its effect on REC injury has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of naringenin on high glucose (HG)-induced REC injury and assess the underlying mechanism. To establish a retinal injury model, human (H)RECs were treated with 30 mM glucose. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and TUNEL staining were used to assess the effects of naringenin on cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and concentration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential cofactor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), were measured using a ROS detection kit and ELISA, respectively. The transfection efficiency of HRECs with guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH1) interfering plasmid was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The protein expression levels of Ki67, proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), eNOS and GTPCH1 were determined by western blot analysis. Compared with the HG-induced group alone, co-treatment with naringenin inhibited HG-induced HREC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, increased expression levels of the proliferation-associated proteins Ki67 and PCNA and effectively decreased intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, naringenin upregulated GTPCH1/eNOS signaling and promoted release of BH4. However, GTPCH1 knockdown partially reversed the ameliorative effect of naringenin on HG-induced HREC injury. In summary, the present study suggested that naringenin effectively inhibited HG-induced HREC apoptosis and intracellular oxidative stress, which may be associated with naringenin-mediated GTPCH1/eNOS upregulation.","output":"Naringenin upregulates GTPCH1/eNOS to ameliorate high glucose-induced retinal endothelial cell injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeReshoring is one of the supply chain risk management techniques suggested in literature. However, literature suggests that the decision-making involved in reshoring is complex and not fully understood. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reshoring may represent a way to reduce reliance on global sources and improve resilience of their supply chains. This paper aims to explore if the pandemic is driving reshoring decisions and if the pandemic will actually lead to companies reshoring parts of their supply chain.Design/methodology/approachThis paper critically engages with senior(-most) supply chain managers from three manufacturing companies as they proceed through reshoring decision-making. This enables to develop experiential knowledge about reshoring decision-making processes and their context, as well as insights into the relevance of existing knowledge about reshoring. While not a full multiple case study, the opportunity to engage directly with senior(-most) supply chain managers as they consider reshoring, enables near real-time learning. Not only is reshoring a very timely topic literature has also called for more event-based empirical research. Further to that, it is hoped that this can complement this special issue and support, in a timely manner, the many researchers that are actively studying the impact of the pandemic on supply chains.FindingsReshoring was being actively considered by all three companies during the research process in Q3 and Q4 of 2020. During this period the pandemic has not yet led to substantial implementation of reshoring, at least by the companies studied in this paper. In response to tariffs on Chinese imports, companies had been diversifying their supply base away from China, but doing so by developing alternative, global sources. Additionally, companies are using alternative risk management techniques, such as supplier collaboration, in the short to medium term. Reshoring decision-making is indeed found to be complex and requires a longer-term time horizon for decision-making and implementation. Logistical challenges and growth in demand do drive a willingness of consumers to pay a premium for locally sourced products. However, when supply normalizes these considerations might lose relevance well before reshoring decision-making and implementation can be completed.Originality/valueThis paper studies reshoring in a real-world setting, learning directly from insights from industry as they emerge. This paper develops four extensions to existing knowledge, develop these in frameworks and hope that this will support ongoing consideration in industry and support the many researchers that are active in this domain today. This paper also suggests several directions for further research.","output":"Towards more balanced sourcing strategies C are supply chain risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic driving reshoring considerations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Climate change presents an unprecedented and urgent threat to human health and survival. South Africas health response will require a strong and effective intersectoral organisational effort. AIM: Exploratory interview outcomes are used to advance practice and policy recommendations, as well as for broad input in the development of a draft national framework for a health risk and vulnerability assessment (RVA) for national departments. SETTING: Nationally in South Africa. METHOD: Twenty key expert interviews were conducted with South African experts in the field of climate change and health. Interview data was analysed by means of thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Findings suggest that previously poor communities are most at risk to the impacts of climate change on health, as well as those with underlying medical conditions. Climate change may also serve as a catalyst for improving the healthcare system overall and should serve as the conduit to do so. A draft climate change and health RVA should take into account existing frameworks and should be implemented by local government. It is also critical that the health and health system impacts from climate change are well understood, especially in light of the plans to implement the (South African) National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.

Life expectancy is a widely used indicator that provides a clear and cross-nationally comparable picture of the population-level impacts of the pandemic on mortality. METHODS: Life tables by sex were calculated for 29 countries, including most European countries, Chile and the USA, for 2015C2020. Life expectancy at birth and at age 60 years for 2020 were contextualized against recent trends between 2015 and 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we examined which specific age groups contributed to reductions in life expectancy in 2020 and to what extent reductions were attributable to official COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth declined from 2019 to 2020 in 27 out of 29 countries. Males in the USA and Lithuania experienced the largest losses in life expectancy at birth during 2020 (2.2 and 1.7 years, respectively), but reductions of more than an entire year were documented in 11 countries for males and 8 among females. Reductions were mostly attributable to increased mortality above age 60 years and to official COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered significant mortality increases in 2020 of a magnitude not witnessed since World War II in Western Europe or the breakup of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe.

The contribution of local anesthetic with deep sedation is unknown. The objective was to evaluate EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream as a pain reliever in conjunction with propofol in the setting of routine lumbar punctures. PROCEDURE We included patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 3-21 years requiring at least two routine lumbar punctures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive EMLA or placebo cream and the alternate treatment with the second procedure. Patients, personnel and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation. The primary outcome included three indirect measures of pain: total median propofol doses, patient movement and heart rate changes at the time of skin puncture in both treatment groups. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 25 were analyzed. With EMLA cream, 4 mg/kg (median) of propofol was required (95% CI 3.5-4.4). With placebo, 4.9 mg/kg of propofol was needed (95% CI 4.3-5.6; P = 0.008). When EMLA cream was applied, 8% of patients moved, whereas 84% moved with placebo cream (P < 0.0001). There was a lower average heart rate by seven beats in the EMLA treatment compared to placebo (95% CI -2.3-4.3; 4.1-12.4; P = 0.009). There were no adverse events in either treatment group.

CD142-EV not only can act as clotting initiation agent, contributing to disease severity, but it turned out to be useful as diagnostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients. Here we aimed at studying the prognostic capacity of CD142-EV in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods: Level of expression of CD142-EV was evaluated in 261 subjects admitted to hospital for pneumonia and with a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. The study population consisted of a discovery cohort of selected patients (n=60) and an independent validation cohort including unselected consecutive enrolled patients (n=201). CD142-EV biomarker performances were correlated with post-hospitalization course of the disease and compared to the clinically available 4C Mortality Score as referral.Findings: CD142-EV showed a reliable performance to predict patient prognosis in the discovery cohort (AUC=0.906) with an accuracy of 81.7%, that was confirmed in the validation cohort (AUC=0.736). Kaplan-Meier curves further highlighted a high discrimination power in unselected subjects with CD142-EV being able to stratify the majority of patients according to their prognosis. We obtained a comparable accuracy, being not inferior in terms of prediction of patients prognosis and risk of mortality with 4C Mortality Score.Interpretation: The detection of CD142 on the surface of EV is a cost-effective and rapid test that can be available at time of admission by using conventional flow cytometer.

Four themes emerged from students reflections on writing about this experience. First, they felt that writing was purposeful and that they were writing for a larger audience. Second, because time and space for critical reflection was provided, some level of renewed dispositions towards the self and others was experienced. Third, writing became an emotionally charged process. Finally, numerous students reflected that writing about something so personal and being encouraged to share their experiences on a public online platform brought about a sense of discomfort.

In the past decade, there has been a shift from an isolated histopathological diagnosis to a multidisciplinary acquired diagnosis consensus that is nowadays regarded to provide the highest level of diagnostic accuracy in patients with diffuse interstitial lung diseases. The 2002 ATS/ERS statement on classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias assigned a central role to high-resolution CT (HRCT) in the diagnostic workup of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (ATS/ERS consensus classification 2002). The more recent 2013 ERS/ATS statement reinforced that combined clinical data (presentation, exposures, smoking status, associated diseases, lung function, and laboratory findings) and radiological findings are essential for a multidisciplinary diagnosis (Travis et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 188(6):733C748, 2013). The traditional HRCT consisted of discontinuous 1 mm high-resolution axial slices. The primary focus was on visual pattern analysis demanding for the highest possible spatial resolution. Because of the intrinsic high structural contrast of the lung, it has been possible to substantially reduce dose without losing diagnostic information. This development has been supported by new detection and reconstruction techniques. Not only detection of subtle disease and visual comparison of disease stage but also disease classification and quantification nowadays take advantage of continuous volumetric data acquisition provided by multidetector row (MD) CT technique. The following book chapter will focus on acquisition technique with special emphasis on dose and reconstruction, advantages, and new diagnostic options of volumetric MDCT technique for interstitial lung diseases.

In this paper, we introduce a fully autonomous surveillance robot based on a quadruped platform that can promote social distancing in complex urban environments. Specifically, to achieve autonomy, we mount multiple cameras and a 3D LiDAR on the legged robot. The robot then uses an onboard real-time social distancing detection system to track nearby pedestrian groups. Next, the robot uses a crowd-aware navigation algorithm to move freely in highly dynamic scenarios. The robot finally uses a crowd-aware routing algorithm to effectively promote social distancing by using human-friendly verbal cues to send suggestions to over-crowded pedestrians.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched until 1 May 2020, for studies examining the proportion of positive chest imaging findings in asymptomatic cases diagnosed with COVID-19 and a random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Among 858 non-duplicate studies, seven studies with a total of 231 asymptomatic cases met the inclusion criteria. In the primary analysis, the pooled estimate of the overall rate of positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings among asymptomatic cases was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44-78%). Among 155/231 cases that were followed up for later symptom development, 90/155 remained asymptomatic and 65/155 developed symptoms during the study period (that ranged between seven and 30 days of follow-up). The pooled estimate of the rate of positive chest CT findings was 62% (95% CI: 38-81%) in cases that remained asymptomatic, while it was 90% (95% CI: 49-99%) in cases that developed symptoms. Among CT findings, the pooled estimate of the overall rate of ground-glass opacities (GGO) at CT alone was 71% (95% CI: 50-86%). Among other CT findings reported, 22/231 patients had GGO with consolidation, 7/231 patients had stripe shadows with or without GGO, and 8/231 patients had GGO with interlobular septal thickening.

During the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), one of the most vulnerable and actively involved in the epidemic process categories of the population were medical workers. The study of the incidence of COVID-19 among medical workers, risk factors for infection and safety measures is an important area of research in modern conditions. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among employees of medical organizations and occupational risk factors for infection in order to develop proposals for corrective measures. Materials and methods. To study the incidence of COVID-19 among employees of medical organizations, an anonymous online questionnaire developed by the authors was used, which was posted on the Google platform and distributed during the first wave of the pandemic among employees of medical organizations in several regions of the Russian Federation through corporate e-mail or specialized online resources adapted for health workers. The survey involved 1,872 medical workers of different genders, ages, positions and work experience. Results and discussion. Among the survey participants, 161 employees have already had a new coronavirus infection. In the majority (64.0%) of them, the disease occurred in the form of acute respiratory infection, in 28.6%-interstitial pneumonia, in 7.4% only the fact of isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen without clinical manifestations of infection was documented. The most affected contingents were secondary and junior medical personnel, mainly hospital staff. The likelihood of infection in the workplace was increased by factors such as providing care to patients with confirmed COVID-19, participating in procedures related to aerosol generation, working with biomaterials of patients with COVID-19, contact with surfaces in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, ignorance of infectious safety issues due to lack of instruction before admission to work. When assessing the efficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE) when they are used in the process, it was found that the highest value for the prevention of infection COVID-19 had a PPE for face protection, respiratory and eye, and hand hygiene. At the same time, many employees are faced with the problem of an insufficient number of protective equipment in the workplace. When assessing the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing to employees, it was found that only 77.4% of survey participants had the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus infection in a timely manner. Conclusion. Thus, for more effective protection of employees of medical organizations, it is necessary to have a sufficient number of personal protective equipment, especially for the face, respiratory organs and vision, the availability of hygienic hand treatment during work, regular instruction on infectious safety, using interactive forms of training, and the organization of screening examinations of previously unvaccinated and unvaccinated employees. ? 2021, Numikom.

The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 spread curves integrating global data and borrowing information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has forced providers to dramatically scale down in-person clinic visits to enforce social distancing and triage care to the neediest patients We describe our five-month experience with a hybrid gastroenterology electronic consultation programme starting in 2019 in which we perform electronic consultations for every referral regardless of indication as well as directly initiate telephone-based telehealth visits with patients without the need for in-person clinic Over five consecutive months, 1243 hybrid electronic consultations were performed with 356 (29%) resulting in a clinic appointment The remaining 887 (71%) electronic consultations were resolved without need for a clinic visit Five hundred and fourteen (41%) electronic consultations resulted in a directly scheduled procedure without clinic appointment Eighty-five per cent of electronic consultations were performed on the same day of referral and 98% of electronic consultations were completed in under 20 min A hybrid electronic consultation model which pre-emptively reviews all outpatient referrals streamlines access to specialty care Such a model may be implemented rapidly during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as well as serve as a platform for long-term improvement in efficiency of care","output":"A model for the pandemic and beyond: Telemedicine for all outpatient gastroenterology referrals reduces unnecessary clinic visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than one year of pandemic (COVID-19) and everything around is disrupted, be it human lives, communities, and businesses all over the world everybody is finding ways and making efforts to integrate in current scenario. The government or private sectors in country everybody is trying all the possible efforts proactively to support the nation and to save lives, and in this situation, CSR has become an integral platform for corporates, government, and NGOs to come in front and take collaborative actions for the welfare of the society. The study is based on the belief that corporate social responsibility is related to the societal concept of the business which states to look beyond the profits. CSR activities performed by the businesses are not confined only to the philanthropic philosophy but beyond that. CSR activities can be integrated in every business function such as while making production of goods companies can follow the production process which can cause less harm to the environment, or they can make eco-friendly products for the safety and health of the customers. By adopting green advertising and Waste disposal policy companies will cause less harm to the customers and become more environment friendly. Employees can be provided better working environment to make employees happier and more satisfied. Thus, even during pandemic situation there are numerous ways to do that. It completely depends upon the company, its resources and its willingness to behave in a socially responsible manner. Ultimately, the social development will get improved by the CSR activities of the companies and the economy will grow, and this why CSR is need of this hour. ?

It represents the third member of genus Circovirus able to infect swine, together with PCV-1, considered non-pathogenic, and PCV-2, one of the most economically relevant viruses for the swine worldwide industry. PCV-3 was originally found by metagenomics analyses in 2015 in tissues of pigs suffering from porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation. The lack of other common pathogens as potential infectious agents of these conditions prompted the suspicion that PCV-3 might etiologically be involved in disease occurrence. Subsequently, viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs, and retrospective studies indicated that PCV-3 was already present in pigs by early 1990s. In fact, current evidence suggests that PCV-3 is a rather widespread virus worldwide. Recently, the virus DNA has also been found in wild boar, expanding the scope of infection susceptibility among the Suidae family; also, the potential reservoir role of this species for the domestic pig has been proposed. Phylogenetic studies with available PCV-3 partial and complete sequences from around the world have revealed high nucleotide identity (>96%), although two main groups and several subclusters have been described as well. Moreover, it has been proposed the existence of a most common ancestor dated around 50 years ago. Taking into account the economic importance and the well-known effects of PCV-2 on the swine industry, a new member of the same family like PCV-3 should not be neglected. Studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and diagnosis are guaranteed in the next few years.

METHODS: A correlational study was conducted to examine the relationship between study variables. Participants were 400 Palestinian adults, involving 172 males and 228 females, living in the city of Tulkarem, Palestine, during the spread of coronavirus. Participants were selected using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. RESULTS: Pearsons correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between positive religious coping, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Findings revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and depressive symptoms (r = ? .17, p < .01). Results also indicated a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and perceived stress (r = ? .15, p < .01). The regression analysis for predicting depressive symptoms found that both positive religious coping (B = ? .21, SE = .05,  = ? .18) and perceived stress (B = .41, SE = .05,  = .35) were statistically significant toward explaining variance in depressive symptoms.

The systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenic mechanism shared by cancer progression and COVID-19. We investigated systemic inflammation as a driver of severity and mortality from COVID-19, evaluating the prognostic role of commonly used inflammatory indices in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer accrued to the OnCovid study. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer in Europe, we evaluated dynamic changes in neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR); Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), renamed the OnCovid Inflammatory Score (OIS); modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS); and Prognostic Index (PI) in relation to oncological and COVID-19 infection features, testing their prognostic potential in independent training (n=529) and validation (n=542) sets. RESULTS: We evaluated 1071 eligible patients, of which 625 (58.3%) were men, and 420 were patients with malignancy in advanced stage (39.2%), most commonly genitourinary (n=216, 20.2%). 844 (78.8%) had 1 comorbidity and 754 (70.4%) had 1 COVID-19 complication. NLR, OIS, and mGPS worsened at COVID-19 diagnosis compared with pre-COVID-19 measurement (p<0.01), recovering in survivors to pre-COVID-19 levels. Patients in poorer risk categories for each index except the PLR exhibited higher mortality rates (p<0.001) and shorter median overall survival in the training and validation sets (p<0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed the OIS to be most independently predictive of survival (validation set HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.20, p=0.001; adjusted concordance index score 0.611). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation is a validated prognostic domain in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and can be used as a bedside predictor of adverse outcome. Lymphocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia as computed by the OIS are independently predictive of severe COVID-19, supporting their use for risk stratification.

We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. Methods: We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, that is stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate a number of strategies including variations of social bubbles, i.e. the forming of exclusive pairs of households, for particular subsets of households (households including children and single occupancy households), as well as for all households. We test the sensitivity of the results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. Results: Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive social bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting some of the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case scenario social bubbles reduced cases and fatalities by 17% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to 1.1 and therefore beyond the epidemic threshold of one. However, strategies that allow households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles only increased the reproduction number by less than 10%. The corresponding increase in morbidity andmortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is largely focussed in older adults independently of whether these are included in the social bubbles. Conclusions: Social bubbles can be an effective way of extending contacts beyond the household limiting the increase in epidemic risk, if managed appropriately.","output":"The effectiveness of social bubbles as part of a Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy, a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic review of the literature investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological and psychosocial factors was completed.

A current concern is that lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could exacerbate the spread of childhood obesity and increase the gap in obesity risk. Recent research results indicate the aggravation of obesity after school closures. The consequences of severe childhood obesity are more devastating than those of mild to moderate obesity. Children with severe obesity are at greater risk than others for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and adult obesity. Accurately assessing and diagnosing a child with severe obesity is the key to implementing successful therapy. A detailed and accurate patient history and physical examination are important to discriminate monogenic obesity and metabolic syndrome diagnoses from severe obesity without an underlying cause. Psychosocial factors, including eating behaviors, should be assessed to facilitate better weight management outcomes. Treatment options for severe pediatric obesity include lifestyle modification therapy, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic and bariatric surgery. However, lifestyle modification should be the priority. Although progress has been made, safe and effective treatment for severe pediatric obesity is still challenging.

The study that the article draws upon revolved around qualitative interviews conducted with seven key informants who were knowledgeable about social, economic and environmental challenges as well as planning and development in the Central Karoo region. The semi-structured interviews were conducted through the online platform of Microsoft Teams. Against the background of low levels of incorporation of regional resilience in the plans that have a bearing on planning and development in the Central Karoo region, it was discovered that the lack of knowledge, financial and human resource constraints and a lack of synergy between different stakeholders were the main reasons for the inadequate incorporation of regional resilience in the subject SDFs. To improve this state of affairs, it is recommended that the stakeholders in the region be empowered on matters pertaining to regional resilience.

Case: The patient arrived with ARDS requiring intubation and distributive shock. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a small left ventricular (LV) cavity with LV hypertrophy, MVR with mean gradient of 14 mmHg, and a mid-peaking transaortic gradient of 96 mmHg consistent with fixed obstruction. This gradient was likely due to LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) from the combination of a small LV cavity and septal angulation of the MVR struts rather than AVR dysfunction. The patient underwent emergent cesarean section. Decision-making: The maternal and fetal risks of ARDS and distributive shock were primary considerations in undergoing cesarean section. Decisions regarding management thereafter were driven by three elements of her clinical presentation - anticipated peripartum hemodynamic shifts, multivalvular disease, and ARDS. The increased plasma volume from postpartum autotransfusion risked worsening her ARDS but also potentially benefited the LVOTO through increased preload. The effect of lower postpartum cardiac output and heart rate on valvular obstruction in series also had to be considered. To balance these hemodynamic demands, after delivery, her vasopressors were switched from norepinephrine to phenylephrine, and she was judiciously diuresed. A postpartum TTE demonstrated improved transmitral gradients (mean 5 mmHg) but ongoing LVOTO. Higher filling pressures than otherwise ideal in ARDS were tolerated given persistent gradients. She was liberated from hemodynamic and ventilator support and transferred out of ICU care. Though she died of infectious complications weeks later, close collaboration between the critical care, obstetrical, and cardiovascular teams were essential to her care. Conclusion: Care of the peripartum patient with cardiovascular disease, especially valvular disease, must take into consideration both their cardiac pathology and expected peripartum hemodynamic shifts.","output":"Pregnancy, Valvular Disease, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ards): a Collaborative Approach to Outcompeting Competing Hemodynamic Demands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"False-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results can negatively impact the clinical and public health response to COVID-19.

Live bacilli can be isolated by culture methods, but this is time-consuming. We developed a de novo TB diagnostic method that detects only live bacilli with high sensitivity within hours. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in Taiwan from 2017 to 2018. Sputum was collected consecutively from 1102 patients with suspected TB infection. The sputum was pretreated and heated at 46C for 1 h to induce the secretion of MPT64 protein from live Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MPT64 was detected with our ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with thionicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. We compared our data with those obtained using a culture test (MGIT), a smear test (Kinyoun staining), and a NAAT (Xpert). FINDINGS: The limit of detection for MPT64 in our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA was 2.0  10(?19) moles/assay. When the criterion for a positive response was set as an absorbance value 17 mAbs, this value corresponded to ca. 330 CFU/mL in the culture method C almost the same high-detection sensitivity as the culture method. To confirm that MPT64 is secreted from only live bacilli, M. bovis BCG was killed using 8 g/mL rifampicin and then heated. Following this procedure, our method detected no MPT64. Our rapid ultra-sensitive ELISA-based method required only 5 h to complete. Comparing the results of our method with those of culture tests for 944 specimens revealed a sensitivity of 86.9% (93/107, 95% CI: 79.0C92.7%) and a specificity of 92.0% (770/837, 95% CI: 89.9C93.7%). The performance data were not significantly different (McNemar's test, P = 0.887) from those of the Xpert tests. In addition, at a 1+ titer in the smear test, the positive predictive value of our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA tests was in a good agreement with that of the culture tests. Furthermore, our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA test had better validity for drug effectiveness examination than Xpert tests because our test detected only live bacilli. INTERPRETATION: Our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA method detects only live TB bacilli with high sensitivity within hours, allowing for rapid diagnosis of TB and monitoring drug efficacy.

The project is expected to reconfigure Santa Cruzs tourism model significantly, while applying rather undemocratic planning practices. This paper explores Santa Cruz Verde 2030, focusing on the perception of local stakeholders. My research builds on 18 qualitative interviews with planning authorities, the citys mayor, political parties, experts from the real estate sector and residents. I identify a large perception gap among the interviewees. While the projects initiators praise the participatory process, other stakeholders feel neither informed nor integrated. In particular, the behind closed doors planning approach has provoked resentment among citizens. In contrast, the possible impact on tourism of the project has given rise to less discussion. This contributes to the stealthy touristification strategy that has already transformed large areas of Santa Cruzs waterfront in past decades. Hence, this paper adds to the ongoing discussion on how to design megaprojects in a more sustainable way, for example, by ensuring political consensus and learning from former megaprojects.","output":"Planning behind Closed Doors: Unlocking Large-Scale Urban Development Projects Using the Stakeholder Approach on Tenerife, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wuhan encountered a serious attack in the first round of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in a public health social impact, including public mental health. Based on the Weibo help data, we inferred the spatial distribution pattern of the epidemic situation and its impacts. Seven urban factors, i.e., urban growth, general hospital, commercial facilities, subway station, land-use mixture, aging ratio, and road density, were selected for validation with the ordinary linear model, in which the former six factors presented a globally significant association with epidemic severity. Then, the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) was adopted to identify their unevenly distributed effects in the urban space. Among the six factors, the distribution and density of major hospitals exerted significant effects on epidemic situation. Commercial facilities appear to be the most prevalently distributed significant factor on epidemic situation over the city. Urban growth, in particular the newly developed residential quarters with high-rise buildings around the waterfront area of Hanyang and Wuchang, face greater risk of the distribution. The influence of subway stations concentrates at the adjacency place where the three towns meet and some near-terminal locations. The aging ratio of the community dominantly affects the hinterland of Hankou to a broader extent than other areas in the city. Upon discovering the result, a series of managerial implications that coordinate various urban factors were proposed.

OBJECTIVE: To determine secular changes in initial neurological severity and short-term functional outcomes of patients with acute stroke by sex using a large population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide, hospital-based, multicenter, prospective registry cohort study used the Japan Stroke Data Bank and included patients who developed acute stroke from January 2000 through December 2019. Patients with stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, who registered within 7 days after symptom onset were studied. Modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed at hospital discharge for all patients. EXPOSURE: Time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Initial severity was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage and by the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grading for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Outcomes were judged as favorable if the modified Rankin Scale score was 0 to 2 and unfavorable if 5 to 6. RESULTS: Of 183 080 patients, 135 266 (53 800 women [39.8%]; median [IQR] age, 74 [66-82] years) developed ischemic stroke, 36 014 (15 365 women [42.7%]; median [IQR] age, 70 [59-79] years) developed intracerebral hemorrhage, and 11 800 (7924 women [67.2%]; median [IQR] age, 64 [53-75] years) developed subarachnoid hemorrhage. In all 3 stroke types, median ages at onset increased, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scores decreased throughout the 20-year period on multivariable analysis. In ischemic stroke, the proportion of favorable outcomes showed an increase over time after age adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.020; 95% CI, 1.015-1.024 for women vs OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.011-1.018 for men) but then stagnated, or even decreased in men, on multivariate adjustment including reperfusion therapy (OR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.991-1.003 for women vs OR, 0.990; 95% CI, 0.985-0.994 for men). Unfavorable outcomes and in-hospital deaths decreased in both sexes. In intracerebral hemorrhage, favorable outcomes decreased in both sexes, and unfavorable outcomes and deaths decreased only in women. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, the proportion of favorable outcomes was unchanged, and that of unfavorable outcomes and deaths decreased in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, functional outcomes improved in patients with ischemic stroke during the past 20 years in both sexes presumably partly owing to the development of acute reperfusion therapy.

METHODS: This multicentre study was conducted in clinically stable, liver transplanted patients. Enrollment opened in June and finished in September 2021. Patients completed a survey including lifestyle data, quality of life (Short Form health survey), sport, employment, diet. To examine the correlations, we calculated Pearson coefficients while to compare subgroups, independent samples t\\\\tests and ANOVAs. To detect the predictors of impaired quality of life, we used multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We analysed data from 511 patients observing significant associations between quality of lifes physical score and both age and adherence to Mediterranean diet (p < .01). A significant negative correlation was observed between mental score and the sedentary activity (p < .05). Female patients scored significantly lower than males in physical and mental score. At multivariate analysis, females were 1.65 times more likely to report impaired physical score than males. Occupation and physical activity presented significant positive relation with quality of life. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was another relevant predictor. Regarding mental score, female patients were 1.78 times more likely to show impaired mental score in comparison with males. Sedentary activity and adherence to Mediterranean diet were further noteworthy predictors.

This provides an opportunity for the gastroenterologist to intervene early with an effective weight-loss therapy. We evaluated the outcomes of a multifaceted, community-based gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program compared with patient-directed weight-loss efforts after physician advice. The program is aimed at achieving a 10% total body weight (TBW) loss at three months, a known determinant for NAFLD regression. Methods This is a retrospective pre- and post-intervention study of NAFLD patients, who participated in a medically supervised weight management program in the period between May 2017 and May 2019. The program is comprised of a very-low-calorie (800 kcal/day) meal replacement diet, a recommended medical fitness program, and weekly behavioral support groups. Patients are followed on monthly basis and slowly transitioned to a whole food plant-based or Mediterranean diet after three months of participation. Patients weight trends driven by self-directed efforts to lose weight after physician advice were collected based on historical data up to two years prior to program participation. The primary outcome was defined as percentage TBW loss at three months under medical supervision (post-intervention) compared with patient-directed weight-loss efforts (pre-intervention). The secondary outcomes included percentage TBW loss in relation to behavioral support group attendance and improvement in GERD and T2DM disease status after program participation. Linear mixed and linear regression models were used to assess for a statistically significant difference in percentage TBW loss. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results A total of 114 NAFLD patients (mean age 55 years, mean BMI 39 kg/m(2), 77 females, and 37 males) completed at least three months of follow-up and were included in the study. Of those, 89 patients had a documented three-month office visit. At three months, 65% of patients had lost at least 10% of their TBW. Percentage TBW loss under medical supervision was noted to be significantly higher and occurred at a faster rate over three months when compared with patient-directed efforts after physician advice (p < 0.001). Patients who attended the behavioral support groups  50% of the time had a 3% higher TBW loss at three months compared with patients who attended <50% of the time (p = 0.006). Approximately, 52% of patients with GERD and 38% of patients with T2DM had symptoms improvement and/or medication reduction at their three-month follow-up visit. Conclusion A multifaceted, community-based, gastroenterologist supervised weight management program is effective in achieving a clinically significant TBW loss of at least 10% within three months of participation. This weight loss was greater and occurred at a faster rate when compared with patient-directed efforts. Additionally, improvement in GERD and T2DM disease status was noted in 52% and 38% of patients with these conditions, respectively. Further community-based studies of a larger scale are needed to determine the sustainability of this weight loss over one year.","output":"Effective Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Using a Community-Based Weight Management Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a respiratory tract infection has been noted to be a causative agent for acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and multiple organ failure.

METHODS Protocol is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42021261123. Eligible studies identified from four electronic databases. Meta-analysis was done to enumerate the outcomes of RIRS in between PS and NPS. Secondary sub-analysis was done to look for differences in outcomes in Asian and non-Asian cohorts. RESULTS Fourteen studies involving 3831 patients (4 prospective, 10 retrospective studies) were included. PS patients experienced higher success rates of ureteral access sheath (UAS) insertion than NPS (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p < 0.00001). PS patients had lower risk of ureteral injuries from UAS placement (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96, p = 0.03). No significant differences in intra- and postoperative complications between two groups were found. Stone-free rate (SFR) outcomes for residual fragment (RF) cut-off of < 1 mm and < 4 mm favoured the PS patients (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.002 for < 4 mm, RR1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19, p = 0.02 for < 1 mm).

CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis suggests that pre-stenting results in a higher success for UAS placement, minimising intraoperative ureteric injury, with higher overall SFR for any RF cut-off in PS cohorts. In non-Asian cohort, significant differences occurred at SFR < 4 mm but not for SFR < 1 mm. No difference was seen in our Asian cohort for any SFR cut-off in both PS and NPS patients.","output":"Role of pre-operative ureteral stent on outcomes of retrograde intra-renal surgery (RIRS): systematic review and meta-analysis of 3831 patients and comparison of Asian and non-Asian cohorts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted all facets of society globally.

However, skepticism about the vaccine efficacy and safety is constantly reported. To our knowledge, there has been no study assessing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Lebanon. The primary objective of this survey is to assess the COVID-19 vaccines acceptance and its related determinants in the Lebanese population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanon from February 16 through February 25, 2021. Data was collected using an online questionnaire via social media platforms using the snowball technique. The questionnaire consisted of 47 questions related to sociodemographic and medical history, COVID-19 experience, knowledge, practice, and beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccines, including vaccines acceptance. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 1209 questionnaires were completed; around 63.4% have reported their acceptance for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 57% of participants registered themselves on the national platform. The multivariable analysis showed that a higher knowledge scale, living in an urban residential area, having hypertension, not having a food allergy, reporting a higher fear to experience COVID-19 infection, and receiving or wanting to receive influenza vaccine, were positive predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptance.

Risk reduction behaviors included hand washing, wearing face mask and social distancing, and the mental distress was assessed by the four-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). We predicted the probability of a person adopting risk reduction behaviors and the mental distress status using the number of days since their state issued the order relative to those in the non-order states, controlling for COVID-19 prevalence in the state, self-reported symptoms and demographic characteristics.

This can affect the pulmonary health and the gastrointestinal system. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to discuss the impact of probiotics/ prebiotics and supplements on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, especially emerging pathogens. METHODS The data were searched were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google Patents, and The Lens-Patent using keywords of probiotics and viral respiratory infections in the title, abstract, and keywords. RESULT Probiotics consumption could decrease the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and simultaneously enhance vaccine efficiency in infectious disease prevention through the immune system enhancement. Probiotics improve the gut microbiota and the immune system via regulating the innate system response and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, treatment with probiotics contributes to the intestinal homeostasis restitution under antibiotic pressure and decreasing the risk of secondary infections due to viral respiratory infections. Probiotics present varied performances in different conditions; thus, promoting their efficacy through combining with supplements (prebiotics, postbiotics, nutraceuticals, berberine, curcumin, lactoferrin, minerals, and vitamins) is important. Several supplements reported to enhance the probiotics' efficacy and their mechanisms as well as probiotics related patents are summarized in this review. Using nanotechnology and microencapsulation techniques can also improve probiotics efficiency. CONCLUSION Given the global challenge of COVID-19, probiotic/prebiotic and following nutritional guidelines should be regarded seriously. Additionally, their role as an adjuvant in vaccination for immune response augmentation needs attention.","output":"Probiotics/ prebiotics in viral respiratory infections: implication for emerging pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc on the health and economy of much of human civilization.

No study has so far evaluated the persistence of endothelial injury after recovery. Purpose We report the results of a systematic biologic assessment more than 12weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19. Methods Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Strasbourg university hospital, France, and tested positive for LA were included in the microparticles in COVID-19 (MICO) study. During the prospective follow-up, blood samples were obtained at least 12weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Results Between March 3 and May 5, 2020, 56 COVID-19 patients with positive LA were included in the study. Five patients were excluded from the analysis because of direct oral anticoagulant treatment at the time of follow-up. A total of 51 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 61years. During the acute phase of COVID-19, 38 patients (74.5%) required mechanical ventilation, 10 patients (19.7%) presented a venous thrombotic event and mean von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) level was 409.5%. Follow-up visit was performed at a median of 144 (interquartile range 129C179) days after COVID-19 diagnosis. LA detection was positive only in three patients (5.9%) and mean level of vWF:Ag was 158.0% at the time of follow-up. No thrombotic event was observed during the follow-up phase (Fig. 1, Table 1). Conclusions We showed disappearance of LA in a large majority of patients and a drastic decrease of vWF:Ag levels, clinically translated by the absence of thrombosis event during the follow-up. Our results suggest that endothelial dysfunction is transient in COVID-19 patients and therefore associated to a potential temporary and limited pathophysiological effect.","output":"Transient endothelial injury and release of lupus anticoagulant in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder frequently accompanied by cognitive impairment. Contributing factors such as modern lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and gene environmental interactions have been postulated, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we attempt to investigate the potential mechanisms and interventions underlying T2DM-induced cognitive deficits from the brain-gut axis perspective. A combined analysis of the brain transcriptome, plasma metabolome, and gut microbiota in db/db mice with cognitive decline was conducted. Transcriptome analysis identified 222 upregulated gene sets and 85 downregulated gene sets, mainly related to mitochondrial respiratory, glycolytic, and inflammation. In metabolomic analysis, a total of 75 significantly altered metabolites were identified, correlated with disturbances of glucose, lipid, bile acid, and steroid metabolism under disease state. Gut microbiota analysis suggested that the species abundance and diversity of db/db mice were significantly increased, with 23 significantly altered genus detected. Using the multi-omics integration, significant correlations among key genes (n = 33), metabolites (n = 41), and bacterial genera (n = 21) were identified. Our findings suggest that disturbed circulation and brain energy metabolism, especially mitochondrial-related disturbances, may contribute to cognitive impairment in db/db mice.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the novel coronavirus disease-19. Downregulation of ACE2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after viral or bacterial infections. The aim of the present study was to examine the anti-inflammatory mechanism through which APC alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro. The present results demonstrated that LPS significantly downregulated the expression of ACE2, while APC significantly reduced LPS-induced ALI and provided beneficial effects. In addition, bioinformatics analysis indicated that microRNA (miR)-200c-3p directly targeted the 3'untranslated region of ACE2 and regulated the expression of ACE2 protein. LPS exposure inhibited the expression of ACE2 protein in A549 cells by upregulating the levels of miR-200c-3p. However, APC inhibited the upregulation of miR-200c-3p induced by LPS, as well as the downregulation of ACE2 protein, through the NF-B pathway. In conclusion, although LPS can inhibit the expression of ACE2 by upregulating the levels of miR-200c-3p through the NF-B pathway, APC inhibited this effect, thus reducing inflammation during LPS-induced ALI.","output":"Acidic preconditioning reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by upregulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we present a rapid and versatile method for capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from transport medium and saliva using affinity-capture magnetic hydrogel particles.

We report the cases of three (3) patients, one known epileptic and the other two apparently healthy, who presented a febrile seizure in a context of COVID-19 infection. The aggravation of the epileptic seizure was indicative of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first patient, while the seizure occurred after induction of chloroquine sulfate treatment in the 2 other patients. Although our current concern is to limit the spread of the disease to COVID-19, it is crucial to address its possible complications. Notably, the worsening of seizures in children with epilepsy and the occurrence of first seizures in children without epilepsy following drug treatment.

This assay measures PR activity as a function of the resonance energy transfer (RET) between a donour molecule [humanized sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase (hRLuc)] and an energy acceptor molecule, humanized green fluorescent protein (hGFP2) when expressed in mammalian cells. This is a naturally occurring phenomenon and is an emerging and powerful technology that has significant advantages over alternative in vitro PR assays. The HIV-1 Gag-p2/Gag-p7 (p2/p7) PR site was inserted between hGFP2 and hRLuc. The newly created vector, hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 was co-expressed with an HIV-1 codon-optimized PR+ or PR? Gag/Pol expressor. Expression of the hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 alone or with the PR? Gag-Pol expressor generated a BRET2 indicating that the PR cleavage site was not cleaved, whereas the inclusion of the PR+ Gag-Pol produced a significant reduction in the BRET2. The inclusion of PR inhibitors Saquinavir or Amprenavir, or the expression of a p2/p7 PR substrate mutant also blocked the cleavage to result in a stable BRET2 signal. Because the HIV-1 auxiliary protein Vif has been shown to modulate the HIV-1 p2/p7 cleavage, this assay was then validated in studies in which Vif was expressed. When Vif was overexpressed along with hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 and PR+ Gag-Pol, the decrease in BRET2 was abrogated in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that supraphysiologic levels of Vif block p2/p7 cleavage. An accumulation of a Gag processing intermediate was observed, indicating that p2/p7 cleavage was negatively affected. Overexpression of an RNA-binding-defective Staufen protein or a related dsRNA-binding protein TRBP had no effect on PR cleavage activity as shown by Western and BRET2 analyses. The p2/p7 processing data were confirmed by Western blot analyses. BRET is non-invasive and occurs within live cells, is measured in real time, and is not restricted to cellular compartments making it an especially attractive technology to identify small bioactive inhibitory molecules. This PR BRET2 biosensor assay can be adapted for high throughput screening of new HIV-1 PR inhibitors. It can be employed to screen for antiviral compounds that also target the proteases of other viruses.","output":"A human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease biosensor assay using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of disasters are increasing due to climate change and unplanned urbanization.

Methods: : Using autopsy results from 9 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the medical records of 407 patients, including 39 deceased patients whose discharge status was certain, time-sequential changes in 11 relevant indices within mild, severe and critical infection throughout hospitalization according to the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) guidelines were evaluated. Statistical tools were applied to calculate the importance of 11 indices and the correlation between those indices and the severity of COVID-19. Results: : At the beginning of hospitalization, platelet (PLT) counts were significantly reduced in critically ill patients compared with severely or mildly ill patients. Blood glucose (GLU), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and D-dimer levels in critical patients were increased compared with mild and severe patients during the entire admission period.

METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. RESULTS: A total of 1189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n = 4) and China (n = 4). The most common type of publication were letters (n = 4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n = 8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n = 7), through one-to-one contact (n = 11), telephone (n = 6) or video conference (n = 5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n = 7) as well as patient counseling (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and/or other pandemic.","output":"Role of pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The APETALA2 (AP2) genes represent the AP2 group within a large group of DNA-binding proteins called AP2/EREBP. The AP2 gene is functional and necessary for flower development, stem cell maintenance, and seed development, whereas the other members of AP2 group redundantly affect flowering time. Here we study the phylogeny of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes. Spermatophyte AP2 group genes can be classified into AP2 and TOE types, six clades, and we found that the AP2 group homologs in gymnosperms belong to the AP2 type, whereas TOE types are absent, which indicates the AP2 type gene are more ancient and TOE type was split out of AP2 type and losing the major function. In Brassicaceae, the expansion of AP2 and TOE type lead to the gene number of AP2 group were up to six. Purifying selection appears to have been the primary driving force of spermatophyte AP2 group evolution, although positive selection occurred in the AP2 clade. The transition from exon to intron of AtAP2 in Arabidopsis mutant leads to the loss of gene function and the same situation was found in AtTOE2. Combining this evolutionary analysis and published research, the results suggest that typical AP2 group genes may first appear in gymnosperms and diverged in angiosperms, following expansion of group members and functional differentiation. In angiosperms, AP2 genes (AP2 clade) inherited key functions from ancestors and other genes of AP2 group lost most function but just remained flowering time controlling in gene formation. In this study, the phylogenies of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes was analyzed, which supported the evidence for the research of gene functional evolution of AP2 group.","output":"Expansion and Functional Divergence of AP2 Group Genes in Spermatophytes Determined by Molecular Evolution and Arabidopsis Mutant Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many drugs have been approved for clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, focusing on either antiviral or anti-inflammatory approaches.

METHODS: The Effect of complex weigHt-reducing interventiOns on rhythm control in oBese subjects wITh Atrial Fibrillation (HOBIT-AF) is a single-blinded, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with 18-month follow-up to assess the effect of complex weight-reducing interventions supported by the use of smart technologies and bariatric surgery on the arrhythmia burden in obese individuals following CA for AF. One hundred and sixty individuals (age 18C70 years, body mass index  30 kg/m(2)) will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to undergo a structured weight reduction programme and sleeve gastrectomy (when indicated and preferred by the patient) aiming to achieve greater than 10% weight reduction from baseline (intervention group) or standard post-ablation medical care (control group). Two-week continuous ECG monitoring will be used 3 and 18 months after CA to assess the arrhythmia burden. Other investigations will include transthoracic echocardiography with quantification of epicardial adipose tissue, and markers of low-grade inflammation and circulating adipokines. PLANNED OUTCOMES: The main objective is to assess the effect of complex weight-reducing interventions on the arrhythmia burden and quality of life. Subgroup analyses to identify patient subgroups preferentially benefiting from weight loss related to a decrease in arrhythmia burden will be performed. Exploratory objectives will include investigation of potential mechanisms linking weight reduction with amelioration of arrhythmia burden such as changes in markers of low-grade inflammation, circulating adipokines, cytokines, monocytes or reduction of epicardial adipose tissue volume.

This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric surgical volumes at four LMIC hospitals. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective pediatric surgical data collected at hospitals in Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Nigeria, and Zambia were reviewed from January 2019 to April 2021. Changes in surgical volume were assessed using interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: 6078 total operations were assessed. Before the pandemic, overall surgical volume increased by 21 cases/month (95% CI 14 to 28, p < 0.001). From March to April 2020, the total surgical volume dropped by 32%, or 110 cases (95% CI ? 196 to ? 24, p = 0.014). Patients during the pandemic were younger (2.7 vs. 3.3 years, p < 0.001) and healthier (ASA I 69% vs. 66%, p = 0.003). Additionally, they experienced lower rates of post-operative sepsis (0.3% vs 1.5%, p < 0.001), surgical site infections (1.3% vs 5.8%, p < 0.001), and mortality (1.6% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001).

When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs","output":"Is Group Testing Ready for Prime-time in Disease Identification?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer research has led to unprecedented advances in treatment in recent decades.

MRSA pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several virulence factors allow S. aureus to become an effective pathogen. The polysaccharide intracellular adhesin allows for the production of biofilms, some strains can produce capsular polysaccharides that protect against phagocytosis, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) allow for colonization of epithelial surfaces, and S. aureus secretes several exotoxins that aid in tissue destruction. The -hemolysin exotoxin secreted by S. aureus is one of the most important virulence factors for the bacteria. The diagnosis of MRSA pneumonia can be challenging; the infection may present as a mild respiratory infection or severe respiratory failure and septic shock. Many individuals are colonized with MRSA and thus a positive nasopharyngeal swab does not confirm infection in the lower respiratory tract. The management of MRSA pneumonia has evolved. Historically, vancomycin has been the primary antibiotic used to treat MRSA pneumonia. Over the past decade, prospective studies have shown that linezolid leads to higher rates of clinical cure.

The outbreak has posed a huge challenge to countries around the world and has resulted in a global lockdown. The pandemic has especially overburdened the healthcare sector, resulting in a shortage of personnel and equipment. Along with many other manifestations, it has resulted in stress and anxiety for the physicians as well. Furthermore, many healthcare workers have been reluctant in treating COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to explore the concerns of physicians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the reasons for their reluctance to treat the patients. Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study included 235 physicians from seven hospitals of Pakistan who were actively working amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020, using a structured online questionnaire. Participants were approached via non-probability convenient sampling. Two hundred and eight respondents were included in the data analysis. SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data entry and analysis. Results A striking 83.7% (n=174) of the respondents expressed their reluctance to treat patients with COVID-19. Concerns they raised included one or more of the following four reasons; lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of self-infection, excessive workload, and fear of transmitting the infection to their family members. Of note, 92% (n=161) of the respondents reported a lack of PPE while 74.1% (n=129) reported fear of transmitting the infection to their family members as reasons for their reluctance. The vast majority of the participants reported the need for psychological training to treat the patients' anxiety (95.2%, n=198). Many participants were afraid that their own anxiety might be affecting the quality of care patients were receiving (67.3%, n=140). Hence, most of the participants reported that psychological counseling should be provided (93.3%, n=194). Participants with family members older than 60 years were found to be reluctant to treat patients due to the risk of transmitting the infection to them (69.7%, n=145, p=0.001). Therefore, a major proportion of the participants (96.2%, n=200) felt that the hospitals should provide a place for them to rest and temporarily isolate themselves to avoid coming into contact with their family members. Conclusions We conclude that a major proportion of physicians is reluctant to treat their patients due to multiple factors. The grave situation of the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health, which could be affecting the quality of care that the patients receive. Their concerns should be addressed to not only provide them with support and improve their working environment but also to ensure that they are fully equipped to provide state-of-the-art care to the patients in these grave times.","output":"Physicians' Attitudes Towards Treating Patients in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, COVID-19 cross-infection is easy to occur in dense places such as elevators.

Local air quality indicators (same day of SE) of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) were obtained from publicly available data sets of the regional authority of environmental protection. After lockdown, NO(2) concentration decreased from 19  10 to 10  4 g/m(3) (p = 0.006). After lockdown, abnormal responses remained unchanged for ischemia (21% vs 16%, p = ns) and decreased for B-lines (42% vs 5%, p = 0.008) and CFVR (84 vs 42%, p = 0.007). Changes in coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) were correlated to same-day variations in NO(2) (r = ?0.578, p = 0.010) and preceding 30-day changes in PM(2.5) (r = ?0.518, p = 0.023).

We found that exposure to Bd metabolites from the California-isolated strain significantly reduced Bd loads of frogs challenged with the live Panam-isolated strain, but no other treatments were found to confer protective effects.

Main outcome measures: Source of COVID-19 infection. Results: Of 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities.

A sequential transfer learning strategy was employed to fine-tune a convolutional neural network in phases on increasingly specific and complex tasks. The COVID-19 positive/negative classification was performed on standard images, soft tissue images, and both combined via feature fusion. A U-Net variant was used to segment and crop the lung region from each image prior to performing classification. Classification performances were evaluated and compared on a held-out test set of 1972 patients using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the DeLong test. Results: Using full standard, cropped standard, cropped, soft tissue, and both types of cropped CXR yielded AUC values of 0.74 [0.70, 0.77], 0.76 [0.73, 0.79], 0.73 [0.70, 0.76], and 0.78 [0.74, 0.81], respectively. Using soft tissue images significantly underperformed standard images, and using both types of CXR failed to significantly outperform using standard images alone.

This study aims to systematically review the evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThis review is part of an Open Evidence Review on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of intrauterine mother to fetus transmission. Literature searches were performed in the WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for SARS-CoV-2 using keywords and associated synonyms, search date up to 20 December 2020, no language restrictions. ResultsWe included 106 studies assessing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their neonates: these studies comprised 40 reviews (21 fulfilled systematic review methodology, including risk of bias assessment of included studies) and 66 primary studies including 32 case reports (of up to two cases) and 34 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, prospective and retrospective case series, observational studies (including asymptomatic screening), database studies and a quality improvement project. Almost all were conducted in a hospital setting. The 32 case reports were considered to be at high risk of bias, due to the study design; across the 34 remaining primary studies, risk of bias was low to moderate. Sixteen case reports examined vertical transmission, which was not related to maternal symptomatology. For the cohort and case series studies, the percentage of positive neonates ranged from 0% to 22% across the studies. Twenty studies reported no positive vertical transmission. Three studies that reported the highest positivity rates of 11%, 15% and 22% had specifically selected neonates with a positive test (within up to 35 days) within the study population and were therefore more selective populations. Across the cohort and case series studies there were 65/2391 (2.7%) neonates born to mothers with a diagnosis of COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of birth. No evidence correlated maternal symptomatology to vertical transmission. Mode of delivery did not correlate with rates of vertical transmission. Of 25 studies, 7 identified SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue; some of these did not demonstrate vertical transmission to the neonate. No study reported the results of viral culture to detect SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionsThe results of these studies indicate that vertical transmission is possible, but is not frequent, and factors that influence when vertical transmission occurs are unknown. Further studies using standardised methods to establish viral infection are needed to establish vertical transmission rates and to assess clinical and other conditions affecting transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and the role of vertical transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses: systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health care globally with restructuring and prioritization of health care services.

Three metaphors differ on ways in which the risk of climate change is expressed in terms of space and time.

This discursive construction of physical scarcity on climate change has significant political and psychological implications. Politically, the scarcity discourse has the risk of increasing a post-political tendency towards managerial control of the global climate (scarcity of politics). Psychologically, however, scarcity has a greater risk of generating a scarcity mindset that inhibits our cognitive capacity to imagine human life beyond managing physical scarcity. Under a narrow mindset of scarcity, the future is closed down to the point of no return that, if crossed, is destined to be the end.

The focus here is on the choice of response alternatives for the types of behavioral frequency questions used in many COVID-19 and other health surveys.

The first are vague quantifiers, like \\"rarely\\" and \\"frequently.\\" Using data from 30 countries from the Imperial COVID data hub, we show that the interpretation of these vague quantifiers (and their translations) depends on the norms in that country. If the mean amount of hand washing in your country is high, it is likely \\"frequently\\" corresponds to a higher numeric value for hand washing than if the mean in your country is low. The second type are precise numeric response alternatives and they can also be problematic. Using a US survey, respondents were randomly allocated to receive either response alternatives where most of the scale corresponds to low frequencies or where most of the scale corresponds to high frequencies. Those given the low frequency set provided lower estimates of the health behaviors.

Chemical transformations intrinsic to evolution and development were characterized by analyzing data from recent phylostratigraphic and proteomic studies.

The main results of this study are a rise in carbon oxidation state of proteins spanning the time of the Great Oxidation Event, a rise in virtual redox potential that coincides with the likely emergence of aerobic metabolism, and a rise in carbon oxidation state of proteins inferred from the transcriptome in late stages of Bacillus subtilis biofilm growth. Furthermore, stoichiometric hydration state of expressed proteins decreases through stages of biofilm development, drops at the same time as a drop in organismal water content during fruit fly development, and is lower for proteins with more recent gene ages, all of which support the inference of higher hydration potentials at earlier time points.

We investigated whether use of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and lyophilised plasma (LyoPlas) was superior to use of 09% sodium chloride for improving tissue perfusion and reducing mortality in trauma-related haemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Resuscitation with pre-hospital blood products (RePHILL) is a multicentre, allocation concealed, open-label, parallel group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done in four civilian prehospital critical care services in the UK. Adults (age 16 years) with trauma-related haemorrhagic shock and hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or absence of palpable radial pulse) were assessed for eligibility by prehospital critial care teams. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive either up to two units each of PRBC and LyoPlas or up to 1 L of 09% sodium chloride administered through the intravenous or intraosseous route. Sealed treatment packs which were identical in external appearance, containing PRBCCLyoPlas or 09% sodium chloride were prepared by blood banks and issued to participating sites according to a randomisation schedule prepared by the co-ordinating centre (1:1 ratio, stratified by site). The primary outcome was a composite of episode mortality or impaired lactate clearance, or both, measured in the intention-to-treat population. This study is completed and registered with ISRCTN.com, ISRCTN62326938. FINDINGS: From Nov 29, 2016 to Jan 2, 2021, prehospital critical care teams randomly assigned 432 participants to PRBCCLyoPlas (n=209) or to 09% sodium chloride (n=223). Trial recruitment was stopped before it achieved the intended sample size of 490 participants due to disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The median follow-up was 9 days (IQR 1 to 34) for participants in the PRBCCLyoPlas group and 7 days (0 to 31) for people in the 09% sodium chloride group. Participants were mostly white (62%) and male (82%), had a median age of 38 years (IQR 26 to 58), and were mostly involved in a road traffic collision (62%) with severe injuries (median injury severity score 36, IQR 25 to 50). Before randomisation, participants had received on average 430 mL crystalloid fluids and tranexamic acid (90%). The composite primary outcome occurred in 128 (64%) of 199 participants randomly assigned to PRBCCLyoPlas and 136 (65%) of 210 randomly assigned to 09% sodium chloride (adjusted risk difference C0025% [95% CI C90 to 90], p=0996). The rates of transfusion-related complications in the first 24 h after ED arrival were similar across treatment groups (PRBCCLyoPlas 11 [7%] of 148 compared with 09% sodium chloride nine [7%] of 137, adjusted relative risk 105 [95% CI 046C242]). Serious adverse events included acute respiratory distress syndrome in nine (6%) of 142 patients in the PRBCCLyoPlas group and three (2%) of 130 in 09% sodium chloride group, and two other unexpected serious adverse events, one in the PRBC-LyoPlas (cerebral infarct) and one in the 09% sodium chloride group (abnormal liver function test). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: The trial did not show that prehospital PRBCCLyoPlas resuscitation was superior to 09% sodium chloride for adult patients with trauma related haemorrhagic shock. Further research is required to identify the characteristics of patients who might benefit from prehospital transfusion and to identify the optimal outcomes for transfusion trials in major trauma.

However, a case has been made for the involvement of the noradrenergic system, which modulates cognitive processes, such as arousal, working memory, and response inhibition, all of which are typically affected in ADHD. Furthermore, the norepinephrine transporter (NET) is an important target for frequently prescribed medication in ADHD. Therefore, the NET is suggested to play a critical role in ADHD.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-two medication-free patients with ADHD (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [10.4] years; 15 [68%] men) without psychiatric comorbidities and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (30.9 [10.6] years; 15 [68%] men) underwent positron emission tomography once. A linear mixed model was used to compare NET BPND between groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The NET BPND in selected regions of interest relevant for ADHD, including the hippocampus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, midbrain with pons (comprising a region of interest that includes the locus coeruleus), and cerebellum. In addition, the NET BPND was evaluated in thalamic subnuclei (13 atlas-based regions of interest). RESULTS We found no significant differences in NET availability or regional distribution between patients with ADHD and healthy controls in all investigated brain regions (F1,41<0.01; P=.96). Furthermore, we identified no significant association between ADHD symptom severity and regional NET availability. Neither sex nor smoking status influenced NET availability.

The present study was designed to answer to this question. METHODS: The population study was the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort which records data about all hospitalized patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for a SARS-CoV-2 infection at Toulouse University hospital, France. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids was assessed at hospital admission. A propensity score (PS) according to corticosteroid exposure was calculated including comorbidities, clinical, radiological and biological variables that impact COVID-19 severity. The primary outcome was composite, including admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation and death occurring during the 14 days after hospital admission. Logistic regression models adjusted for the PS (overlap weighting) provided odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Overall, 253 patients were included in the study. Median age was 64 years, 140 patients (59.6%) were men and 218 (86.2%) had at least one comorbidity. Seventeen patients (6.7%) were exposed to corticosteroids before hospital admission. Chronic inflammatory disease (n = 8) was the most frequent indication. One hundred and twenty patients (47.4%) met the composite outcome. In the crude model, the OR of previous exposure to systemic corticosteroids was 1.64; 95% CI: 0.60C4.44. In the adjusted model, it was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.65C1.83). CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provide some evidences for an absence of an increased risk of unfavorable outcome with previous exposure to corticosteroids in the general setting of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Therefore, benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) is less evident. We performed an exploratory analysis of EVT results compared to conservative treatment in patients with 'carotid-I' occlusions. METHODS We report on EVT-treated and non-EVT-treated patients with carotid-I occlusions from the MR CLEAN Registry, MR CLEAN trial, and our comprehensive stroke center. CT-angiography was reviewed on primary collateral patency and choroid plexus enhancement. Perfusion deficits were assessed on CT-perfusion (CTP). Clot migration was assessed by comparing clot location on baseline CTA to its location on periprocedural digital subtraction angiography. Outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS 0-2), successful reperfusion and mortality. RESULTS We included 51 patients. Forty-one patients received EVT, ten patients did not. Intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 32 (78%) EVT-treated patients and 6 (60%) non-EVT-treated patients. CTP, available for 17 patients, showed hypoperfusion on cerebral blood flow maps in 13 (76%) patients. Successful reperfusion after EVT occurred in 23 (56%), and clot migration in 8 patients (20%). Functional independence was achieved in 54% (21/39) of EVT-treated and in 10% (1/10) of non-EVT-treated patients. Mortality was 26% (10/39) and 30% (3/10), respectively. Anterior choroidal artery patency and choroid plexus enhancement were positively associated with functional independence.

An annual global mortality of around 8 million patients places major surgery comparable with the leading causes of death from cardiovascular disease and stroke, cancer and injury. If surgical complications were classified as a pandemic, like HIV/AIDS or coronavirus (COVID-19), developed countries would work together and devise an immediate action plan and allocate resources to address it. Seeking to reduce preventable deaths and post-surgical complications would save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Part of the global problem resides in differences in institutional practice patterns in high- and low-income countries, and part from a lack of effective perioperative drug therapies to protect the patient from surgical stress. We briefly review the history of surgical stress and provide a path forward from a systems-based approach. Key to progress is recognizing that the anesthetized brain is still physiologically 'awake' and responsive to the sterile stressors of surgery. New intravenous drug therapies are urgently required after anesthesia and before the first incision to prevent the brain from switching to sympathetic overdrive and activating secondary injury progression such as hyperinflammation, coagulopathy, immune activation and metabolic dysfunction.

For disease prediction tasks, most existing graph-based methods tend to define the graph manually based on specified modality (e.g., demographic information), and then integrated other modalities to obtain the patient representation by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, constructing an appropriate graph in advance is not a simple matter for these methods. Meanwhile, the complex correlation between modalities is ignored. These factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing sufficient information about the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Multi-modal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction with multi-modality. To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with the disease, modality-aware representation learning is proposed to aggregate the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the graph manually, the latent graph structure is captured through an effective way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Our model is also applicable to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group of experiments on two disease prediction tasks demonstrates that the proposed MMGL achieves more favorable performance.

In order to investigate the relationship between tactile preference and innate sociability, mice were subjected to the classic three-chambered test of social approach, where mice displayed significant preference towards the experimenter's hand.

Main Outcome and Measures: Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, as measured through 7-day average cases, in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was compared to the rest of Washtenaw County. A generalized additive model was fitted with non-parametric trends for control and relative differences of trends in the pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention periods to compare intervention municipalities of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti to the rest of Washtenaw County.

Given that these limitations could impact successful telemedicine use, we aimed to investigate the experiences of patients with parkinsonism using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 19-item survey was emailed to patients with parkinsonism following telemedicine visits at a single US tertiary care parkinsonism specialty clinic. Seventy-four individuals responded, out of 270 invitations sent. Almost two-thirds (61.6%) of the respondents were comfortable with using technology in general, and almost all were very satisfied with their telemedicine experience. The most commonly reported benefits included cost and travel savings, ease of access to a specialist, and time savings. Issues with technology and previsit instructions were the most commonly identified challenges (28%). Urgent implementation, due to the pandemic, of telemedicine care for patients with parkinsonism was feasible and well received. The challenges most commonly reported by patients could be potentially alleviated by better education and support.","output":"Response to Telemedicine Visits From Patients With Parkinsonism During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postvisit Surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children in most cases is asymptomatic or mild, and its most severe late complication is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The aim of the study is to find clinical, laboratory and instrumental characteristics, description of therapeutic tactics, including determination of the profile of patients requiring Tocilizumab prescription and the outcomes of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Materials and methods of research: 245 children aged 3 months C 17 years old were included in the pilot prospective multicenter open-label comparative study with MIS-C associated with COVID-19, verified based on CDC criteria (2020). Results: the median age of patients was 8 [5;10] years, boys predominated among the patients (57.1%);MIS-C manifested itself as a combination of the symptom complex of Kawasaki disease (KD, 53.1% of patients), more often of atypical form, cardiovascular (66.1%), gastrointestinal (61.2%), neurological (27.3%) symptoms and signs of detection of the urinary (29.4%) and respiratory (19.6%) systems;macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was diagnosed in 19.5% of patients. Therapy included glucocorticosteroids (97.6%), antibiotics (95.5%), anticoagulants (93.9%), intravenous immunoglobulin (34.7%), vasoactive/vasopressor support (31.8%), Tocilizumab (15.1%), mechanical ventilation (2.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (0.4%). Patients receiving Tocilizumab, statistically significantly more often compared with patients without this therapy, were in the intensive care unit (ICU, 86.5% versus 40.9%, p<0.001), more often required vasopressor therapy (70.3% versus 25%, p<0.001), had statistically significantly higher markers of laboratory inflammatory activity. Treatment in 47.8% of cases was carried out in an ICU;one child has died. In 4.1%, according to echocardiography, coronaritis, ectasia of the coronary arteries without the formation of persistent aneurysms were detected. Conclusion: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 has clinical signs of KD, often of the incomplete form, accompanied by arterial hypotension/shock, MAS, which requires intensive therapy, and the prescription of Tocilizumab.

In the circulation, these membranous vesicles are mainly derived from blood or vascular cells, and they carry cargos with distinct molecular signatures reflecting the origin and activation state of parent cells that produce them, thus providing a powerful tool for diagnosis and prognosis of pathological conditions. Functionally, circulating EVs mediate tissue-tissue communication by transporting bioactive cargos to local and distant sites, where they directly interact with target cells to alter their function. Recent evidence points to the critical contributions of EVs to the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction during inflammatory response to injury or infection. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the current knowledge on EV biology and advanced techniques in EV isolation and characterization. This is followed by a discussion focusing on the role and mechanisms of EVs in regulating blood-endothelium interactions and vascular permeability during inflammation.

While contact tracing and case investigation have been carefully designed to protect privacy, the huge volume of tracing which is being carried out as part of the pandemic response in the United States is highlighting potential concerns around privacy, legality, and equity. Contact tracing during the pandemic has gained particular attention for the new use of digital technologiesboth on the consumer side in the form of Exposure Notification applications, and for public health agencies as digital case management software systems enable massive scaling of operations. While the consumer application side of digital innovation has dominated the news and academic discourse around privacy, people are likely to interact more intensively with public health agencies and their use of digital case management systems. Effective use of digital case management for contact tracing requires revisiting the existing legal frameworks, privacy protections, and security practices for management of sensitive health data. The scale of these tools and demands of an unprecedented pandemic response are introducing new risks through the collection of huge volumes of data, and expanding requirements for more adept data sharing among jurisdictions. Public health agencies must strengthen their best practices for data collection and protection even in the absence of comprehensive or clear guidance.

On the other hand, the different factors that modulate the biological activity of these compounds are less well known. Conceptualization of the work: In this review we took into account about 200 relevant and recent papers on the following topics: polyphenols bioavailability, polyphenols matrix effect, food matrix effect, polyphenols-cytochromes interaction, after having reviewed and updated information on chemical classification and main biological properties of polyphenols, such as the antioxidant, anti-radical and anti-inflammatory activity, together with the tricky link between in vitro tests and clinical trials. Key findings: the issue of polyphenols bioavailability and matrix effect should be better taken into account when health claims are referred to polyphenols, thus considering the matrix effect, enzymatic interactions, reactions with other foods or genetic or gender characteristics that could interfere. We also discovered that in vitro studies often underrate the role of phytocomplexes and thus we provided practical hints to describe a clearer way to approach an investigation on polyphenols for a more resounding transfer to their use in medicine.","output":"Polyphenols: From Theory to Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, and it continues to threaten public health. This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. from January 2020 to early April 2020. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations and teleworking trends regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical mobility interventions. All metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states before the stay-at-home mandates implemented and becomes more stable after the order with a smaller range of fluctuation. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. As the estimated teleworking rates also continue to incline throughout the study period, the teleworking trend can be another driving factor for the growing stay-at-home population. We confirm that there exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The study suggests that public mobility trends are in line with the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.","output":"Human mobility trends during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Tele-forensic interviews have the potential to aid investigations when children live far from interviewers, there is a risk of disease transmission, or when expertise is not locally available. However, it is unknown whether tele-forensic interviewing is an effective alternative to face-to-face interviewing, particularly for children most prone to suggestibility and lapses of attention. HYPOTHESES: Previous studies suggested that school-age children would provide similar amounts of information across interview modes but provided no basis for predicting how misinformation impacts accuracy across modes or how 4- and 5-year-olds would react to tele-forensic interviewing. METHOD: Children (4-8 years, N = 261, Mage = 6.42 years, 48% female) interacted with male assistants who violated a no-touching rule, parents read children a book containing misinformation about that event, and female assistants conducted interviews (usually 2 weeks after the event) face-to-face or via a video conference application. RESULTS: The children were more talkative during a practice narrative phase when interviewed face-to-face rather than on screen (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.26, 95% CI [1.06, 1.51]), and 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds said more in response to open-ended prompts when interviewed face-to-face (IRR = 1.50, 95% CI [1.08, 2.09]). Children younger than 7 years also disclosed the face touch and noncompleted handshake in response to earlier and less directive prompts when interviewed face-to-face, rs(53) = .28, p = .037, and rs(48) = .33, p = .021, respectively. Children 8 years and older, however, disclosed the face touch more readily when they spoke on screen, rs(28) = -.38, p = .036, and older 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds disclosed the noncompleted handshake more readily on screen, rs(30) = -.36, p = .042. Across interview modes, children reported comparable numbers of touch events, however, and were equally accurate on challenging source-monitoring and detail questions.

METHODS We retrospectively identified consecutive patients, between January 2005 and December 2010, treated with APC for an index diagnosis of gastric VE. Clinical and endoscopic features and APC treatment success were recorded. Treatment success was determined by resolution of symptoms and stabilization of the hemoglobin level at 30% above baseline. RESULTS A total of 62 patients [28 (45.2%) male] with a mean age of 72.6  12.8 years, who had undergone 159 upper endoscopies (mean 2.6, range 1-10), including 140 APC sessions (mean 2.3, range 1-10), were identified.

However, it is known that a dysfunctional immune response and the accompanying uncontrollable inflammation lead to troublesome outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pannexin1 channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viral infections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early on in the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1 channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels. Thusthree new inhibitors of pannexin1 channels were identified that, though currently not being used anymore for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, could be potential drug candidates for other pannexin1-related diseases.","output":"Effects of Drugs Formerly Suggested for COVID-19 Repurposing on Pannexin1 Channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discovery of durable memory B cell (MBC) subsets against neutralizing viral epitopes is critical for determining immune correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection Here, we identified functionally distinct SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cell subsets by profiling the repertoire of convalescent COVID-19 patients using a high-throughput B cell sorting and sequencing platform Utilizing barcoded SARS-CoV-2 antigen baits, we isolated thousands of B cells that segregated into discrete functional subsets specific for the spike, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and open reading frame (ORF) proteins 7a and 8 Spike-specific B cells were enriched in canonical MBC clusters, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from these cells were potently neutralizing By contrast, B cells specific to ORF8 and NP were enriched in na?ve and innate-like clusters, and mAbs against these targets were exclusively non-neutralizing Finally, we identified that B cell specificity, subset distribution, and affinity maturation were impacted by clinical features such as age, sex, and symptom duration Together, our data provide a comprehensive tool for evaluating B cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and highlight the complexity of the human B cell response to SARS-CoV-2","output":"Distinct B cell subsets give rise to antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like novel coronavirus strain first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) increased Daoy MB cell invasion, adhesion, and in vivo cellular protrusion formation. ACM conditioning of MB cells also increased CD133 surface expression, a key cancer stem cell marker of MB. Additional neural stem cell markers, Nestin and Oct-4A, were also increased by ACM conditioning, as well as neurosphere formation. By knocking down CD133 using short interfering RNA (siRNA), we showed that ACM upregulated CD133 expression in MB plays an important role in invasion, adhesion and neurosphere formation.

As a primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) exists in different hosts that are in close contact with humans, especially cats and dogs. However, the underlying mechanism of how the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 cooperates with human ACE2 (hACE2), cat ACE2 (cACE2) and dog ACE2 (dACE2) and the variation in binding remains largely unsolved. Therefore, we explored the binding behavior of the spike RBD with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2 via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. In accordance with the binding free energies and residue interactions, the spike RBD has respective binding specificities with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2, and the binding affinities decrease in the order of hACE2, cACE2, dACE2, mainly due to changes in the amino acids Q24L, H34Y, and M82T in cACE2 or dACE2. Furthermore, alanine scanning analysis results validated some key residues of the spike RBD interact with ACE2 and provided clues to the variation of amino acid that could influence the transmissibility or immune responses of SARS-CoV-2. Decreasing dynamic correlations strengths of ACE2 with the RBD were found in all hACE2-RBD, cACE2-RBD and dACE2-RBD systems. The ACE2 protein shows variable motion modes across the zinc metallopeptidase domain, which induces different interactions between ACE2 and the RBD. Our studies reveal that the motion pattern of the zinc metallopeptidase domain is critical to the binding behavior of RBD with ACE2. These findings could aid our understanding of selective recognition involving various ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and shed further light on the binding mechanisms.","output":"Molecular insights into the binding variance of the SARS-CoV-2 spike with human, cat and dog ACE2 proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the survey responses of 278 individuals who transitioned from the workplace to working from home (WFH) as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic to understand how individuals attainment of productivity in work and meaning in life are affected by WFH.

Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases.

Here, we report a novel type of phytosulfokine, PSK-, and its precursor proteins (MtPSK, LjPSK, and GmPSK1), specifically from legume species. The sulfated PSK- peptide has the sequence YSO3IYSO3TN, different from PSK- at the last amino acid. Expression pattern analysis revealed PSK--encoding precursor genes to be expressed primarily in legume root nodules. Specifically, in Medicago truncatula, MtPSK expression was detected in root cortical cells undergoing nodule organogenesis, in nodule primordia and young nodules, and in the apical region of mature nodules. Accumulation of sulfated PSK- peptide in M. truncatula nodules was detected by LC/MS. Application of synthetic PSK- peptide significantly increased nodule number in legumes. Similarly, overexpression of MtPSK in transgenic M. truncatula markedly promoted symbiotic nodulation. This increase in nodule number was attributed to enhanced nodule organogenesis induced by PSK-. Additional genetic evidence from the MtPSK mutant and RNA interference assays suggested that the PSK- and PSK- peptides function redundantly in regulating nodule organogenesis.

Self-obtained paired rectal samples, one gargle sample and one first-void urine sample were collected from participants to generate two sets of samples: one for pooled sample testing and the other for single-site testing. We used modified pooled sampling, which is defined as the use of gargle samples, instead of swabs, for the pooled sample to test for pharyngeal infection. RESULTS This study included 513 MSM. The positive rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were 20.3% and 11.7%, respectively, for single-site sample testing. Compared with the sensitivity of single-site testing as the gold standard, the sensitivities of pooled sample testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were 94.2% (95% CI 88.0% to 97.3%) and 98.3% (95% CI 90.9% to 99.9%), respectively.

Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. METHOD: Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) during November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. RESULTS: 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate=80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94C1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27C3.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD. Those who were female, aged 45 or above, reported low family income, or reported an average or poor family environment were associated with a higher risk of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries.

We showed that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1C5 M) dose-dependently promoted DiI-LDL uptake in HepG2 cells by upregulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein. In HepG2 cells, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1C10 M) dose-dependently enhanced LDLR promoter activity by elevating the mature form of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 2) protein levels on one hand, and inhibited PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) promoter activity by attenuating HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1) protein levels in nuclei on the other hand. Consequently, the expression of LDLR protein markedly increased, whereas the PCSK9-mediated LDLR protein degradation decreased. In a high-cholesterol LVG golden Syrian Hamster model, administration of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (30 mg  kg(?1)? d(?1), intragastric, for 3 weeks) significantly decreased the serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.

This can lead to under- or over-identification of DLD in this population. This study endeavors to contribute to overcoming this problem, by determining whether two specific clinical markers used with the Italian monolingual population can also be used with early L2 acquiring children, namely clitic production and non-word repetition. Our study involved two groups of 5-year-old L2 learners of Italian from various language backgrounds; 18 children had been referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) services (EL2_DLD), and 30 children were typically developing (EL2_TD). The participants completed an Italian clitic production task and a non-word repetition task based on Italian phonotactics. Data was also collected from the participants' caregivers with the ALDeQ Parental Questionnaire to obtain information about the children's L1. Our results suggest that non-word repetition and clitic production in Italian are potentially useful for identifying L2 learners of Italian with DLD, at the age of 5 years. The repetition of non-words is highly accurate in identifying children with DLD among the participants, while clitic production is somewhat less discriminative in this sample.

Multi-factorial causes include the nature and structure of work. We conducted a critical review of UK NHS (England) data pertaining to: doctors, nurses, midwives and paramedics. SOURCES OF DATA: Key demographic, service architecture (structural features of work) and well-being indicators were identified and reviewed by a stakeholder group. Data searching prioritized NHS whole workforce sources (focusing on hospital and community health services staff), which were rated according to strength of evidence. FINDINGS: Key differences between professions were: (i) demographics: gender (nursing and midwifery female-dominated, doctors and paramedics more balanced); age (professions other than doctors had ageing workforces); ethnicity (greater diversity among doctors and nurses); (ii) service architecture: despite net staffing growth, turnover and retention were problematic in all professions; 41.5% doctors were consultants but smaller proportions held high grade/band roles in other professions; salaries were higher for doctors; (iii) well-being: all reported high job stress, particularly midwives and paramedics; sickness absence rates for nurses, midwives and paramedics were three times those of doctors, and presenteeism nearly double. GROWING POINTS: Sociocultural factors known to increase risk of poor mental health may explain some of the differences reported between professions. These factors and differences in service architecture are vital considerations when designing strategies to improve well-being.

Pu22 is a mutated and shorter analog of the G4-forming sequence known as Pu27 located in the promoter of the c-myc oncogene, whose overexpression triggers the metabolic changes responsible for cancer cells transformation. The binding of tPD with the parallel Pu22 G4 was confirmed by CD spectroscopy, which showed significant changes in the CD spectrum of the DNA and a slight thermal stabilization of the G4 structure. To gain a deeper insight into the structural features of the tPD-Pu22 complex, we performed an in silico molecular docking study, which indicated that the interaction of tPD with Pu22 G4 may involve partial end-stacking to the terminal G-quartet and H-bonding interactions between the sugar moiety of the ligand and deoxynucleotides not included in the G-tetrads. Finally, we compared the experimental CD profiles of Pu22 G4 with the corresponding theoretical output obtained using DichroCalc, a web-based server normally used for the prediction of proteins CD spectra starting from their .pdb file.

Traditionally, patient glucose values are relayed by telephone for provider feedback, but digital health technology can now enable the remote sharing of glucose data via mobile apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of remote glucose monitoring in a population of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed T1D and to explore whether remote monitoring alters habits for self-review of glucose data or perceived ease of provider contact in this population as compared to a nonrandomized control group. METHODS: Data were collected from families who chose to participate in remote monitoring (intervention group) as well as from patients receiving usual care (control group). The intervention group received Bluetooth-capable glucose meters and Apple iPod Touch devices. Patient-generated glucose data were passively relayed from the meter to the iPod Touch and then to both the electronic health record (EHR) and a third-party diabetes data platform, Tidepool. The principal investigator reviewed glucose data daily in the EHR and Tidepool and contacted the participants as needed for insulin dose adjustments during the time between hospital discharge and first clinic appointment. Families in the control group received usual care, which involved keeping written records of glucose values and contacting the diabetes team daily by telephone to relay data and receive treatment recommendations. A total of 40 families (20 for the intervention group and 20 for the control group) participated in the study. All families were surveyed at 1 month and 6 months regarding self-review of glucose data and ease of contacting the diabetes team. RESULTS: Patient-generated glucose data were remotely accessible for 100% of the participants via Tidepool and for 85% via the EHR. Survey data indicated that families in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to review their glucose data using mobile health apps after 1 month (P<.001), but by 6 months, this difference had disappeared. Perceived ease of contacting the clinical team for assistance was lower for the intervention group after 6 months (when receiving usual care) in comparison to during the intervention period (P=.48) and compared with a control group who did not have exposure to remote monitoring (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Remote glucose monitoring is feasible among pediatric patients with newly diagnosed T1D and may be associated with the earlier adoption of mobile health apps for self-management. The use of broadscale remote monitoring for T1D in the future will depend on improved access to Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices for all patients, improved interoperability of mobile health apps to enable data transfer on Android as well as Apple devices, and new provider workflows to handle large-scale panel management based on patient-generated health data.

HSV-1 strains lacking ICP34.5 are attenuated in growth and pathogenesis in animal models and in primary cultured cells. While this growth defect has been attributed to the inability of an ICP34.5-null virus to counteract the induction of translational arrest through the PKR antiviral pathway, the role of autophagy in the regulation of HSV-1 replication is unknown. Here we show that HSV-1 infection induces autophagy in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts and that autophagosome formation is increased to a greater extent following infection with an ICP34.5-deficient virus. Elimination of the autophagic pathway did not significantly alter the replication of wild-type HSV-1 or ICP34.5 mutants. The phosphorylation state of eIF2alpha and viral protein accumulation were unchanged in HSV-1-infected cells unable to undergo autophagy. These data show that while ICP34.5 regulates autophagy, it is the prevention of translational arrest by ICP34.5 rather than its control of autophagy that is the pivotal determinant of efficient HSV-1 replication in primary cell culture.","output":"Analysis of the role of autophagy in replication of herpes simplex virus in cell culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale.

Over the past century, however, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems have come to the fore, justifying expansion of the meaning of \\"autonomic.\\" Additional facets include the sympathetic adrenergic system, for which adrenaline is the key effector; the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis; arginine vasopressin (synonymous with anti-diuretic hormone); the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with angiotensin II and aldosterone the main effectors; and cholinergic anti-inflammatory and sympathetic inflammasomal pathways.

While required for appropriate responses in emergencies, EAS activation in the setting of chronically decreased homeostatic efficiencies (dyshomeostasis) may reduce thresholds for induction of destabilizing, lethal vicious cycles. Testable hypotheses derived from these concepts are that biomarkers of EAS activation correlate with clinical and pathophysiologic data and predict outcome in COVID-19 and that treatments targeting specific abnormalities identified in individual patients may be beneficial.","output":"The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Follow-up study of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors has rarely been reported.

Collective interhospital transport of critically ill COVID-19 patients as a way to mitigate the localised pressure from overloaded intensive care units at a national or international level has not been reported yet. The aim of this study was to provide descriptive data about the first six collective aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC) of COVID-19 patients performed within Europe. Methods: This retrospective study included all adult patients transported by the first six collective MEDEVAC missions for COVID-19 patients performed within Europe on the 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, 31st of March and the 3rd of April 2020. Results: Thirty-six patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were transported aboard six MEDEVAC missions. The median duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU before transportation was 4 days (3-5.25). The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio obtained before, during the flight and at Day 1 after the transport was 180 mmHg (156-202,5), 143 mmHg (118,75-184,75) and 174 mmHg (129,5-205,5), respectively, with no significant difference. The median norepinephrine infusion rate observed before, during the flight and at Day 1 after the transport was 0,08 g/kg-1.min-1 (0,00-0,20), 0,08 (0,00-0,25), and 0,07 (0,03-0,18), respectively, with no significant difference.

While extensive research on the role of the Receptor Binding Domain on viral infectivity and vaccine sensitivity has been documented, the role of the spike 681PRRAR/SV687 polybasic motif is less clear. Here we monitored infectivity and vaccine sensitivity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus against sera samples that were drawn four months post administration of the third dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Our findings show that relative to Wuhan-Hu and Delta SARS-CoV-2, Omicron displayed enhanced infectivity and a sharp decline in its sensitivity to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, while the spike proteins form Wuhan-Hu (P681), Omicron (H681) and BA.2 (H681) pseudoviruses modestly promoted cell fusion and syncytia formation, Delta spike (P681R) displayed enhanced fusogenic activity and syncytia formation capability. Live-viruses plaque formation assays confirmed these findings and demonstrated that relatively to the Wuhan-Hu and Omicron SARS-CoV-2, Delta formed more plaques that were smaller in size. Introducing a single P681R point mutation within the Wuhan-Hu spike, or H681R within Omicron spike, restored fusion potential to similar levels observed for Delta spike. Conversely, a R681P point mutation within Delta spike efficiency abolished fusion potential. We conclude that over time, the efficiency of the third dose of the Pfizer vaccine against SARS CoV-2 is waned, and cannot neutralize Omicron. We further verify that the P681 position of the viral spike dictates fusogenicity and syncytia formation.","output":"P681 mutations within the polybasic motif of spike dictate fusogenicity and syncytia formation of SARS CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primatological research is often associated with understanding animals and their habitats, yet practical conservation depends entirely on human actions.

While many primatologists accept the benefits of more socially inclusive dimensions of research and conservation practice, in reality there remain many challenges. We discuss the role primatologists can play to enhance interdisciplinary working and their relationships with communities living in and around their study sites, and examine how increased reflexivity and consideration of ones positionality can improve primatological practice. Emphasis on education and stakeholder consultation may still echo colonial, top-down dialogues, and the need for greater emphasis on genuine knowledge-sharing among all stakeholders should be recognised. If we are sincere about this approach, we might need to redefine how we see, consider, and define conservation success. We may also have to embrace more compromises. By evaluating success in conservation we explore how reflexive engagements with our positionality and equitable knowledge-sharing contribute to fostering intrinsic motivation and building resilience.","output":"Working from the Inside Out: Fostering Intrinsic Motivation and Expanding Our Criteria for Conservation Success"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative online public sentiment generated by government mishandling of pandemics and other disasters can easily trigger widespread panic and distrust, causing great harm. It is important to understand the law of public sentiment dissemination and use it in a timely and appropriate way. Using the big data of online public sentiment during the COVID-19 period, this paper analyzes and establishes a cross-validation based public sentiment system dynamics model which can simulate the evolution processes of public sentiment under the effects of individual behaviors and governmental guidance measures. A concrete case of a violation of relevant regulations during COVID-19 epidemic that sparked public sentiment in China is introduced as a study sample to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. By running the model, the results show that an increase in government responsiveness contributes to the spread of positive social sentiment but also promotes negative sentiment. Positive individual behavior suppresses negative emotions while promoting the spread of positive emotions.

A growing collection of empirical literature suggests that housing can act as a low-cost recovery support system which could be effective in helping those with SUD sustain their recovery. Such settings could be already housing many residents affected by COVID-19. Many of these residents are at high risk for COVID-19 given their histories of SUD, homelessness, criminal justice involvement, and psychiatric comorbidity. Stable housing after treatment may decrease the risk of relapse to active addiction, and these types of settings may have important implications for those with housing insecurity who are at risk for being infected with COVID-19.

However, cosmopolitans lack a substantive theory of how to develop sufficient motivation to give globally. Secondly, the statists account of the motivation to give is deficient because it fails to recognise the motivational force of a common national identity among people. Thirdly, Millers account is more plausible than the statists but fails to facilitate a dynamic process whereby peoples national identities could be extended to the global level in order to support the cosmopolitan project. This needs to be supplemented by the statists understanding of democratic processone which incorporates the principles of Habermass communicative action as a mechanism for developing social solidarity among people.

A total of 1,500 urban residents of South Korea, selected from an online public panel, were surveyed using self-rating questionnaires addressing daily life changes, fear of infection, and distress related to COVID-19. Participants also completed a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale survey. We constructed regularized partial correlation networks, estimated global and local network metrics, tested network accuracy and stability, and compared the estimated networks between men and women. The network of the psychosocial responses consisted of 24 nodes that were classified into five groups: fear of infection, difficulty with outside activities, economic loss, altered eating and sleeping, and adaptive stress. The node centralities indicated that distress in obtaining daily necessities and concern about harming others were the most important issues in peoples responses to COVID-19. These nodes were connected by a negative edge, reflecting individual- and community-level issues, respectively. The overall level of perceived stress was linked to the network by the connection node anger toward others or society, which was associated with economic problems in men, but with distress from changes in daily activities in women.

Understanding balance impairments in ankle OA may help inform the management of this condition. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does balance overall performance differ between individuals with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and healthy controls? Are there any differences in mediolateral or anteroposterior balance, or confidence to perform balance tasks between these groups? METHODS: Ninety-six volunteers (31 symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, 41 asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and 24 healthy controls) completed six static balance tasks: bilateral stance on a firm surface, bilateral stance on foam, and tandem stance, all performed with eyes open and closed. Centre of pressure (COP) data were collected using force plates. Confidence to perform each balance task was collected using an 11-point numerical rating scale. RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA had greater COP area when standing on a firm surface, foam and in tandem with eyes closed (all p < 0.05) and greater total COP sway in both firm surface and tandem stance conditions (p < 0.04). Participants with symptomatic ankle OA had greater COP area (p < 0.04) and total COP sway (p = 0.01) than those with asymptomatic ankle OA during tandem stance. Total COP sway and area were similar between asymptomatic ankle OA and control participants. Some differences in mediolateral and anteroposterior balance were identified between groups. Individuals with symptomatic ankle OA had lower confidence to perform the tandem stance eyes closed task compared to controls. SIGNIFICANCE: Balance impairments and decreased balance confidence were identified in those with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA compared to asymptomatic individuals with and without radiographic ankle OA. This suggests that balance deficits in ankle OA may be related to symptoms, rather than radiographic evidence of disease.","output":"Balance is impaired in symptomatic ankle osteoarthritis: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Catechin and their derivatives have been studied to have antiviral potential against COVID-19 through in silico method pharmacokinetics screening and molecular docking.

Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. METHODS: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. RESULTS: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine.

To estimate all-cause excess deaths in Mexico City (MXC) and New York City (NYC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We estimated expected deaths among residents of both cities between March 1 and August 29, 2020, using log-linked negative binomial regression and compared these deaths with observed deaths during the same period. We calculated total and age-specific excess deaths and 95% prediction intervals (PIs). Results. There were 259 excess deaths per 100 000 (95% PI = 249, 269) in MXC and 311 (95% PI = 305, 318) in NYC during the study period. The number of excess deaths among individuals 25 to 44 years old was much higher in MXC (77 per 100 000; 95% PI = 69, 80) than in NYC (34 per 100 000; 95% PI = 30, 38). Corresponding estimates among adults 65 years or older were 1263 (95% PI = 1199, 1317) per 100 000 in MXC and 1581 (95% PI = 1549, 1621) per 100 000 in NYC. Conclusions. Overall, excess mortality was higher in NYC than in MXC; however, the excess mortality rate among young adults was higher in MXC. Public Health Implications. Excess all-cause mortality comparisons across populations and age groups may represent a more complete measure of pandemic effects and provide information on mitigation strategies and susceptibility factors.

Particularly, this study analyzes stock response to eight pandemic related news in 2020 across different industries. This study also investigates the role that the market risk, beta, plays in such stock reactions. Design/methodology/approach: This study computes the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) around COVID-19 events using adjusted daily stock returns of all stocks in the S&P 500 index between January 2, 2020 and December 31, 2020. This study also sorts all stocks by beta into quintiles and measures the CAR [0, +3] for each quintile around each event date. Findings: This study finds that low beta portfolios exhibit greater abnormal returns (in absolute value) than high beta portfolios during down markets while high beta portfolios exhibit greater abnormal returns (in absolute values) when the market starts to recover. However, this study finds that beta does not seem to explain the abnormal returns reported in various industries during times of negative sentiment. During times of positive sentiment, both the beta effect and industry effect are present. Originality/value: Extant literature almost unanimously concurs that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about negative stock reactions to financial markets across the globe. Nevertheless, three interrelated issues have not been explored: market reactions during the subsequent recovery, industry heterogeneity and individual stocks risk profile.

What challenges do these children face when they switch to a different school system and language? This paper addresses these questions in the context of family return migration to Latvia, based on 40 in-depth interviews with children, their parents and key informants  teachers, school support staff and return-migration coordinators. We find that imaginings of a smooth reintegration into a parental homeland of extended family and friends may not be realised; instead, many children, particularly those of secondary and upper primary-school age, experience the move as a rupture in their lives. School may be fraught with unrealistic expectations on all sides, not helped by poor communication between parents, teachers and support staff. The lack of fluency in the Latvian language is seen by teachers as an obstacle, rather than something to be accepted and worked with. Most teachers are unfamiliar with children from different backgrounds and origins and need training in diversity, tolerance and differentiated learning. This will become increasingly necessary in a country like Latvia, with its ongoing high rates of international migration and return. Our findings show that the educational system and childrens experiences of schooling play a crucial role in returnee families overall reintegration. This raises the importance of return preparedness for the children, including language preparation and awareness of pedagogical and curriculum differences.","output":"The Challenges of Educational Reintegration and the Psychosocial Wellbeing of Returnee Children: Evidence from Latvia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study methods of diagnosis and treatment for atypical pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), outbreak of the illness in Guangzhou during Jan. - Mar., 2003.

METHODS: From 13 March to 9 April 2020, all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and discharged alive were included in this retrospective observational study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of 30-day readmission, and a restricted cubic spline function was utilized to assess the linearity of the association between continuous predictors and 30-day readmission.

We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces.

To have a baseline data and to form the basis for further vaccination drive, we carried out this study with an objective to understand the perception and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs). Methods: A correctional study was carried out at one of the multispecialty hospital in North India where COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs was planned and 675 HCWs were taken into the study. Data were collected by means of personal interview using pretested semi-structured questionnaire and Epi Info version 6 was used for analysis. Results: The mean age of the participants was 32.78 years. Majority were male (89.48%), working in government sector (87.7%) and paramedic (88.15%). While 94.67% were accepting vaccine voluntarily while remaining were not confident enough on their own, only 26.96% were ready to take vaccine even on payment.

On the last day of the experiment, all birds and remaining feed were weighed individually and a sample of blood was taken to measure the serum activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The capacity of intestinal cells for the absorption of D-xylose was measured. Finally all birds were killed humanely and the intestine and liver were weighed. 4. The results showed that TA significantly reduced BWG and FCR, as well as the activity of LDH, AST and ALT. 5. TA also increased the relative weight of the intestine. Adding PEG alone had no effect on any of the measured parameters. 6. However, PEG improved significantly BWG, FCR and the activity of LDH and AST of TA-fed birds. 7. The plasma D-xylose concentration of experimental birds was similar for all dietary treatments most likely because of temporal separation between feeding the dietary TA and administering the D-xylose. 8. It was concluded that the presence of tannins in the GI lumen of the bird was necessary to affect the processes involved in the absorption of simple sugars such as D-xylose, at the level of intestinal absorptive cells.","output":"Influence of dietary tannic acid and polyethylene glycol on growth and intestinal D-xylose absorption of broiler cockerels and activity of serum enzymes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surging COVID-19 pandemic has raised ethical and moral dilemmas that Western nations with first-rate medical care facilities rarely confront-how to best allocate standard life-saving medical resources when escalating demand outstrips supply.

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","output":"Physicians' Attitudes Toward Telemedicine Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND HIV testing and counselling (HTC) is an essential component for HIV prevention and a critical entry point into the HIV continuum of care and treatment. Despite the importance of HTC for HIV control, access to HTC services among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains suboptimal and little is known about factors influencing FSWs' access to HTC. Guided by the client-centred conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic review to understand the facilitators and barriers influencing FSWs in SSA to access HTC services. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, POPLINE and Web of Science databases for literature published between January 2000 and July 2017. References of relevant articles were also searched. We included primary studies of any design, conducted in SSA and published in the English language. Studies conducted in multi-sites inclusive of SSA were included only if data from sites in SSA were separately analysed and reported. Similarly, studies that included other subpopulations were only eligible if a separate analysis was done for FSWs. This review excluded papers published as systematic reviews, editorial comments and mathematical modelling. The protocol for this review is registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42017062203. RESULTS This review shows that factors related to approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness of the services are crucial in influencing access to HTC services among FSWs in SSA. These factors were mediated by individual attributes such as HIV risk perceptions, awareness of the availability of HTC, and perceptions of the importance and quality of HTC services. The decision to utilise HTC was predominantly hampered by discriminatory social norms such as HIV stigma and criminalisation of sex work. CONCLUSIONS FSWs' access to HTC is facilitated by multiple factors, including individual awareness of the availability of HTC services, and perceived quality of HTC especially with regard to assured confidentiality. Concerns about HIV stigma and fear about discrimination due to community intolerance of sex work acted as major barriers for FSWs to seek HTC services from the facilities offering health services to the general population.","output":"Determinants of access to HIV testing and counselling services among female sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses have marked their significant emergence since the twenty-first century with the outbreaks of three out of the seven existing human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These viruses have not only acquired large-scale transmission during their specified outbreak period, but cases of MERS-CoV still remain active, although there is only limited transmission. While, on the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a rising threat to global public health. The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects-all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus' differing deadly pattern.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: a new dimension to our understanding of coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are zoonotic pathogens that originated in wild animals.

A paucity of data exists on outcome of patients with vasculitis following COVID-19, but mortality is higher than in the general population and comparable to patients undergoing haemodialysis or kidney transplant recipients (reported mortality rates of 20C25%). Delays in diagnosis have been reported, which are associated with sequelae such as dialysis-dependency. Management of ANCA-associated vasculitis has not changed with the aim to suppress disease activity and reduce burden of disease. The use of rituximab, an important and widely used agent, is associated with a more severe hospital course of COVID-19 and absence of antibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infections, which prone patients to re-infection. Reports on vaccine antibody response are scarce at the moment, but preliminary findings point towards an impaired immune response, especially when patients receive rituximab as part of their treatment. Seropositivity was reported in less than 20% of patients when rituximab was administered within the prior six months, and the antibody response correlated with CD19+ B-cell repopulation. A delay in maintenance doses, if disease activity allows, has been suggested using a CD19+ B-cell guided strategy. Other immunosuppressive measures, which are used in ANCA-associated vasculitis, also impair humoral and cellular vaccine responses.

We characterized Black/White disparities among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 in Cuyahoga County which has some of the most extreme health disparities in the U.S., such as a rate of Black infant mortality that is three times that of White counterparts. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using data collected as part of public health surveillance between March 16, 2020 until October 1, 2020. This study aimed to compare Black and Non-Black pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to understand how the distribution of risk factors may differ by race. Outcomes included age, gestational age at infection, medical co-morbidities, exposure history, socio-economic status, occupation, symptom severity and pregnancy complications. FINDINGS: One hundred and sixty-two women were included. 81 (50%) were Black, 67 (41%) White, 9 (005%) Hispanic, 2 (001%) Asian; and three did not self-identify with any particular race. More than half who supplied occupational information (n = 132) were essential workers as classified by the CDC definition (55%, n = 73). Black women were younger (p = 00062) and more likely to identify an occupational contact as exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0020). Non-Black women were more likely to work from home (p = 0018) and indicate a personal or household contact as their exposure (p = 0020). Occupation was a risk factor for severe symptoms (aOR 4487, p = 0037). Most Black women lived in areas with median income <$39,000 and Black women were more likely to have a preterm delivery (222% versus 0%, p = 0026). INTERPRETATION: Many pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 are essential workers. Black women are more likely than White counterparts to have occupational exposure as the presumed source for their infection. Limitations in occupational options and controlling risk in these positions could be related to lower socio-economic status, resulting from a long history of structural racism in Cuyahoga County as evidenced by redlining and other policies limiting opportunities for people of color.

Copeptin, C-terminal portion of Vasopressin (AVP) precursor is stable;however, evidence about impact of PSS on copeptin levels is limited. Aim: The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of psychological stress on copeptin levels among HCP working in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: A total of 70 HCP served in quarantine ICU participated in this prospective study;35 physicians (28 males and 7 females) and 35 nurses (10 males and 25 females). A control group of 40 HCP matched age, BMI and specialty in non- quarantine hospitals. Fasting morning blood samples were withdrawn for determination of copeptin, cortisol, insulin at three points;pre-quarantine at ICU. Second point at end of first week and third point was two weeks' post quarantine. A questionnaire was conducted to all participants to assess stress (PSS). Cortisol was determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay while insulin and Copeptin were measured by ELISA. Results: Baseline plasma copeptin level pre-quarantine was significantly increased 15.76 +/- 8.6 pmol/l (P = 0.001*) and was positively correlated with high stress PSS score mean 66.9 +/- 18.3. Post-quarantine copeptin was markedly reduced 3.98 +/- 1.28 pmol/l and mean PSS was 23.0 +/- 7.95 (P = 0.001*). Also, there was positive correlation between plasma copeptin and PSS, systolic blood pressure and serum insulin. On the other hand, there was no correlation between copeptin and serum cortisol.

METHODS Thirty rats were randomized into the SM, IR, NI, MI, and DI group (n = 6). The rats in the SM group were shamly operated, and those in the IR group were subjected to 4-hour ischemia of the right hindlimb that was followed by 4-hour reperfusion. Intraperitoneal administration of Nec-1 1 mg/kg, Mdivi-1 1.2 mg/kg and same volume of DMSO were given before ischemia in the NI, MI and DI groups, respectively. Upon reperfusion, the soleus muscles were harvested to determine morphological changes and the expression of RIP1, total Drp1 and p-Drp1 (Ser616). Moreover, the muscular oxidative stress indicators and plasma muscle damage biomarkers were detected. RESULTS IR led to impaired histopathological structures and mitochondrial fragmentation in the soleus muscle tissue, accompanied with increased muscular oxidative stress and muscle injury biomarkers, which could be similarly alleviated by Mdivi-1 and Nec-1 (p < 0.05). RIP1 and p-Drp1 (Ser616) protein levels were significantly upregulated in the soleus muscle subjected to IR injury, this upregulation was attenuated in the NI group, and Mdivi-1 downregulated the protein expression of p-Drp1 (Ser616) but not of RIP1 (p < 0.05).

Sleep problems lead to secondary effects on other aspects of wellbeing and cognitive functioning, increasing the risk of errors and workplace accidents. A wide range of interventions has been proposed to improve the sleep quality of nurses and promote an increase in attention levels. In recent years, particular attention has been paid to individual and environmental factors mediating the subjective ability to cope with sleep deprivation during the night shift.

Our study aimed to acquire a snapshot of the practice of multidisciplinary team (MDT) management and variability in response to rapidly emerging guidelines. METHODS The survey was disseminated to 150 colorectal cancer MDTs across England and Wales taken from the National Bowel Cancer Audit data set between 15 April and 30 June 2020 for completion by colorectal surgeons. RESULTS Sixty-seven MDTs responded to the survey. Fifty-seven centres reported that they continued to perform colorectal cancer resections during the initial lockdown period. Fifty centres (74.6%) introduced routine preoperative COVID-19 testing and 50 (74.6%) employed full personal protective equipment for elective cases. Laparoscopic resections were continued by 25 centres (42.1%), whereas 28 (48.3%) changed to an open approach. Forty-nine (79.0%) centres reported experiencing patient-led surgical cancellations in 0-25% of their listings. If surgery was delayed significantly then 24 centres (38.7%) employed alternative neoadjuvant therapy, with short-course radiotherapy being their preferred adjunct of choice for rectal cancer. Just over 50% of the MDTs stated that they were uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with their management strategies.

Adopting this perspective brings attention to how conditions in neighbourhoods (directly and indirectly) affect their inhabitants physical health and mental wellbeing. However, considerably less attention has been paid to how to alleviate such conditions through integrated interventions designed to operate specifically at the neighbourhood scale. To address this gap, this paper introduces the term unhealthy neighbourhood syndrome (UNS). The conceptual clar-ity and practical utility offered by using this term are critically examined. The paper contains a rigorous review and critical analysis of academic and grey literature on what are held to be the relationships between key features of the built environment and peoples health and wellbeing. It also examines literature offering advice on how urban designers should make neighbourhoods healthier. It illustrates the complexity of the range of issues involved and the complicated web of top down, bottom up and middling out actors that need to be involved in making decisions about them. Despite having inherent weaknesses, the term unhealthy neighbourhood syndrome is judged to be useful. It illustrates how seemingly separate issues operate in urban design, promoted for tackling specific symptoms of ill health, need to be addressed jointly through an integrated programme of parallel work streams operating at the neighbourhood scale. The paper is innovative in identifying the wide cluster of symptoms used to describe unhealthy neighbourhoods in the literature as being a syndrome. Its significance lies in its injunction that this syndrome needs to be tackled through integrated streams of remedial action drawing on experience and expertise that lie beyond those offered by the traditional membership of urban design teams. ? 2021 by the authors.

Despite the critical role in regulating infectivity, its distinctive features, origin, and evolution are scarcely understood. Thus, we undertook a structure-guided positional and compositional analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 FC, in comparison with FCs of related viruses, tracing its origin and ongoing evolution. We found that clustered amino acid substitutions within HR1, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1, enhance local heptad stereotypy and increase sharply the FC serine-to-glutamine (S/Q) ratio, determining a neat alternate layering of S-rich and Q-rich subdomains along the post-fusion structure. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 ranks among viruses with the highest FC S/Q ratio, together with highly syncytiogenic respiratory pathogens (RSV, NDV), whereas MERS-Cov, HIV, and Ebola viruses display low ratios, and this feature reflects onto S/Q segregation and H-bonding patterns. Our evolutionary analyses revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 FC occurs in other SARS-CoV-1-like Sarbecoviruses identified since 2005 in Hong Kong and adjacent regions, tracing its origin to >50 years ago with a recombination-driven spread. Finally, current mutational trends show that the FC is varying especially in the FC1 evolutionary hotspot. These findings establish a novel analytical framework illuminating the sequence/structure evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 FC, tracing its long history within Sarbecoviruses, and may help rationalize the evolution of the fusion machinery in emerging pathogens and the design of novel therapeutic fusion inhibitors.","output":"Heptad stereotypy, S/Q layering, and remote origin of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion core"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While current research efforts focus primarily on identifying patient level interventions that mitigate the direct impact of COVID-19, it is important to consider the collateral effects of COVID-19 on antimicrobial resistance Early reports suggest high rates of antibiotic utilization in COVID-19 patients despite their lack of direct activity against viral pathogens The ongoing pandemic is exacerbating known barriers to optimal antibiotic stewardship in the ED, representing an additional direct threat to patient safety and public health There is an urgent need for research analyzing overall and COVID-19 specific antibiotic prescribing trends in the ED Optimizing ED stewardship during COVID-19 will likely require a combination of traditional stewardship approaches (e g academic detailing, provider education, care pathways) and effective implementation of host response biomarkers and rapid COVID-19 diagnostics Antibiotic stewardship interventions with demonstrated efficacy in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on ED prescribing should be widely disseminated and inform the ongoing pandemic response","output":"COVID-19: An Emerging Threat to Antibiotic Stewardship in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: The novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with worse outcomes for hospitalized patients across the US and worldwide.

Methods: We performed retrospective chart review of 7689 consecutive patients seen through two Tele-Stroke networks (Medical University of South Carolina and Augusta University) from July 2019 through May 2020. Discharge outcomes were assessed using modified Rankin scale (mRS). We dichotomized patients to preCOVID-19 pandemic (July 2019 to February 2020) and during COVID- 19 pandemic (March to May 2020). Results: During COVID, a higher percentage of patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (14.2% vs 11.3% before, p=0.001), despite a similar baseline NIHSS. Also, patients during the pandemic had a shorter symptom-onset to hospital door time (288 vs 353, P=0.012).

In this paper, we will review a few vaccine trials equipped with adaptive design features, Bayesian designs that accommodate historical data borrowing, the master protocol strategy emerging during COVID-19 vaccine development, Real-World-Data (RWD) embedded trials and the correlate of protection framework and relevant research works. We will also discuss some statistical methodologies that improve the vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity analyses. Innovative clinical trial designs and analyses, together with advanced research technologies and deeper understanding of the human immune system, are paving the way for the efficient development of new vaccines in the future.","output":"Innovative trial designs and analyses for vaccine clinical development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: To provide an overview of compounding under sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and to describe the pharmacist's role within the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Compounding Incidents Program, whose efforts are aimed at protecting the public against poor-quality compounded drugs through surveillance, review and response to adverse events and complaints. SUMMARY: Compounded drugs may serve an important medical need for patients who cannot be treated with medications approved by FDA; however, compounded drugs are not approved by FDA and are not subject to premarket review for safety, efficacy, or manufacturing quality; thus, they may pose safety risks to patients. Prompt reporting of adverse events or complaints related to compounding is important in identifying these risks and implementing safeguards to protect the public. FDA's Compounding Incidents Program consists of a team of pharmacists dedicated to the surveillance and review of adverse events and complaints and follow-up actions related to safety risks associated with compounded drugs. Pharmacists are a vital component of FDA's Compounding Incidents Program, utilizing their clinical skill set and regulatory knowledge to review and act on safety issues that affect public health. CONCLUSION: As FDA continues to expand the Compounding Incidents Program and its efforts to protect the public against poor-quality compounded drugs, we encourage the continued submission of adverse event reports by healthcare professionals and consumers to FDA's MedWatch reporting system in addition to adverse event reporting compliance by outsourcing facilities.","output":"A pharmacist-driven Food and Drug Administration incident surveillance and response program for compounded drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 as a viral pandemic in early 2020 resulted in notable changes to the daily practice, workflow, and education of orthopaedic residencies internationally. In particular, social distancing, residency restructuring, and redeployment to other services has increased heterogeneity in schedules and made the in-person gathering of trainees for education increasingly challenging. These changes may last until 2024 based on some mathematical models, resulting in notable disruptions to orthopaedic education, especially for junior residents.

Based on a systematic review of previous studies, this paper summarizes the research progress on factors influencing the spatial spread of COVID-19 from the research content and method and proposes the main development direction of geography in epidemic prevention and control research in the future. Overall, current studies have explored the factors influencing the epidemic spread on different scales, including global, national, regional and urban. Research methods are mainly composed of quantitative analysis. In addition to the traditional regression analysis and correlation analysis, the spatial lag model, the spatial error model, the geographically weighted regression model and the geographic detector have been widely used. The impact of natural environment and economic and social factors on the epidemic spread is mainly reflected in temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pollutants, population movement, economic development level and medical and health facilities. In the future, new technologies, new methods and new means should be used to reveal the driving mechanism of the epidemic spread in a specific geographical space, which is refined, multi-scale and systematic, with emphasis on exploring the factors influencing the epidemic spread from the perspective of spatial and behavioral interaction, and establish a spatial database platform that combines the information of residents cases, the natural environment and economic society.

METHODS: Internet-based survey by invitation of IBD services across the UK from 8 to 14 April 2020. RESULTS: Respondents from 125 IBD services completed the survey. The number of whole-time equivalent gastroenterologists and IBD nurses providing elective outpatient care decreased significantly between baseline (median 4, IQR 4C7.5 and median 3, IQR 2C4) to the point of survey (median 2, IQR 1C4.8 and median 2, IQR 1C3) in the 6-week period following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Almost all (94%; 112/119) services reported an increase in IBD helpline activity. Face-to-face clinics were substituted for telephone consultation by 86% and video consultation by 11% of services. A variation in the provision of laboratory faecal calprotectin testing was noted with 27% of services reporting no access to faecal calprotectin, and a further 32% reduced access. There was also significant curtailment of IBD-specific endoscopy and elective surgery. CONCLUSIONS: IBD services in the UK have implemented several adaptive strategies in order to continue to provide safe and high-quality care for patients. National Health Service organisations will need to consider the impact of these changes in current service delivery models and staffing levels when planning exit strategies for post-pandemic IBD care.

The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential biomarkers specific for TB. METHODS: The surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from 180 cases of TB and 211 control subjects. A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), identified by MALDI-TOF MS, LC-MS/MS and validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: A total of 35 discriminating m/z peaks were detected that were related to TB (P < 0.01). The model of biomarkers based on the four biomarkers (2554.6, 4824.4, 5325.7, and 8606.8 Da) was established which could distinguish TB from controls with the sensitivity of 83.3% and the specificity of 84.2%. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 2554.6 Da was found to be up-regulated in TB patients, and was identified as a fragment of fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide isoform alpha-E preproprotein.

We piloted a BC early-detection program in Eswatini aimed at increasing breast health knowledge and clinical skills. We also aimed to determine the proportion of patients with breast abnormalities who completed referral to breast specialty clinics. METHODS: Nurses and counselors from five human immunodeficiency virus and/or antiretroviral therapy clinics underwent training in BC and clinical breast examination (CBE). We compared knowledge and skill examinations completed before, immediately after, and 90 days after training. Nurses then screened female clinic patients  18 years for breast symptoms, examined those with symptoms, and referred women with CBE abnormalities to a surgeon or the national breast clinic. Consenting women were contacted at 30 and 60 days after screening to determine if they had completed referral. RESULTS: In 2019, 44 nurses underwent training. Median scores (interquartile range) on pretraining, immediate post-training, and 90-day post-training knowledge examinations were 17.5 (16-19), 20 (19-21), and 20 (19-21), respectively. Median scores (interquartile range) on pretraining, immediate post-training, and 90-day post-training skills examinations were 10 (7-11), 23 (21.5-25), and 23 (22-24), respectively. Compared with pretraining scores, post-training scores were significantly improved (P < .0001 for all comparisons). From June 2019 to April 2020, a total of 9,502 clinic patients were screened for breast symptoms: 150 (2%) underwent CBE, 93 (62%) were referred for further evaluation, and 88 (97%) were included in the study. Of those, 54 (61%) completed referral. Referral completion was not associated with age, employment, relationship status, or prior experiences related to BC.

San Jose Animal Care and Services implemented a new strategy designed to control overall feral cat reproduction by altering and returning feral cats entering the shelter system, rather than euthanizing the cats. The purpose of this case study was to determine how the program affected the shelter cat intakes over time. In just over four years, 10,080 individual healthy adult feral cats, out of 11,423 impounded at the shelter during this time frame, were altered and returned to their site of capture. Included in the 11,423 cats were 862 cats impounded from one to four additional times for a total of 958 (9.5%) recaptures of the previously altered 10,080 cats. The remaining 385 healthy feral cats were euthanized at the shelter from March 2010 to June 2014. Four years into the program, researchers observed cat and kitten impounds decreased 29.1%; euthanasia decreased from over 70% of intakes in 2009, to 23% in 2014. Euthanasia in the shelter for Upper Respiratory Disease decreased 99%; dead cat pick up off the streets declined 20%. Dog impounds did not similarly decline over the four years.

Single-incision surgery, as its possible advancement, has also received more attention. Traditional laparoscopic surgery with carbon dioxide insufflation precluded patients with underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease from minimal invasive surgery. We report our early experience with gasless single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair via totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. METHODS Between 2010 and 2012, 15 consecutive patients underwent gasless laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by the same surgeon, using abdominal wall lifting technique with a self-tailored device. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operative findings and postoperative outcomes were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS Of the 15 patients, all had unilateral hernia. Two presented with acute incarceration, in which one required bowel resection. There was no conversion to open surgery or insertion of additional ports. The median operating time was 80 min (range 51-130) for elective repair and 178 min (range 135-220) for emergency repair. The median hospital stay was 1 day (range 1-6) with minimal requirement of analgesics. Median time taken to resume normal activity was 2 days (range 1-6). No major medical complications or mesh infection was encountered. One patient developed hematoma and was successfully managed by salvage laparoscopic reoperation. During a median follow-up of 54 months (range 38-60), none experienced recurrence. CONCLUSION Gasless single-incision TEP is feasible with favorable results, even in high-risk patients with compromised cardiorespiratory status.

Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1st of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support.

We used PyMOL to analyse the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 14 compounds from Psidium guajava and three antiviral (lopinavir, remdesivir and ritonavir) used as positive control. Results Based on the molecular docking analysis, it was found there are two potential compounds that showed higher binding affinity score namely gamma sitosterol and peri-xanthenoxanthene-4,10-dione,2,8-bis (1-methylethyl). Conclusions Gamma sitosterol and peri-xanthenoxanthene-4,10-dione,2,8-bis (1-methylethyl) from Psidium guajava have potential as antiviral candidates for SARS-CoV-2 multiple proteins such as main protease (3CLPro), Papain Like Protease (PL Pro), MPro, Spike and ACE2.","output":"Active constituents and Molecular Analysis of Psidium guajava Against Multiple Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns as to its impact on other health programs. One program that appears particularly vulnerable is HIV and AIDS. We undertook an assessment of COVID-19 impact on HIV control efforts in Indonesia for a sub-population that has received little attention in the global literaturefemale sex workers (FSW). METHODS: The study was undertaken in 23 National AIDS program priority districts. Four sources of monthly data during JanuaryCJuly 2020 were considered. COVID-19 infection data were extracted from national and district surveillance systems. Combination prevention program outputs were reported by civil society organizations (CSOs) providing community support services to FSW. These organizations also undertook monthly scans of levels of commercial sex activity and HIV testing availability. We also considered data from an ongoing HIV community screening trial. The primary mode of analysis entailed comparisons of levels and trends of indicators from the four data series. RESULTS: Commercial sex activity was severely curtailed in AprilCMay in many districts. While recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels in Localization areas, the number of active FSW in July was one-third below that in February. HIV testing service availability declined by 50% at health facilities before recovering slowly, while mobile clinic services largely ceased during AprilCJune. Numbers of FSW reached, condoms distributed, FSW tested for HIV, HIV cases detected, and FSW starting treatment all declined precipitously in April/May but had largely recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels by July. We found only a temporary dip in treatment initiation rates among HIV positive FSW and no discernible impact on treatment retention. The HIV community screening trial data revealed significant demand for HIV testing among FSW that was not being met even before the onset of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had at least short-run economic effects on FSW and the national response to HIV and AIDS targeting FSW. However, the effects appear to have been cushioned by community-based services and support in study districts. The findings make a compelling case for the expansion of community-based services irrespective of the future trajectory of COVID-19. As COVID-19 has not yet been contained, the trajectory of economic activity and service delivery is uncertain.","output":"The short-term effects of COVID-19 on HIV and AIDS control efforts among female sex workers in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Art education interventions improve observation skills among dermatology residents, but there is limited data regarding their benefits to wellness and clinical communication. METHODS: Residents in the Stanford dermatology residency program participated in an arts-based education session, repeated in the fall of 2018 and 2019, that included a rotation of observational exercises adapted from the Artful Thinking program through Harvard Project Zero. The 2018 session featured exercises on identification and understanding of visual observation, while the 2019 session featured exercises on perspectives and objectivity of visual observation. Participants completed preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys in fall 2018 and a postintervention survey in fall 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-one residents participated in the 2018 education session and produced an adequate response rate (62%-90%) across surveys. At 3 months, five of 13 residents (39%) reported new use of art for mindfulness and stress reduction, 12 of 13 (92%) could recall an example of use of observation to improve patient communication, and four of 13 (31%) confirmed and described adjustments to their handoff technique. In 2019, 13 out of 18 participants (72%) completed the postintervention survey. Responses reinforced themes from the prior iteration but focused on perspective, objectivity, context, and uncertainty in observations. Respondents also identified additional arenas of communication to benefit from these observational techniques. DISCUSSION: Dermatology residents increased use of art for personal wellness and adjusted clinical communication strategies after a single arts-based education session.

Materials and Methods Lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres were prepared by thin-film hydration method using lentil lectin derivatives (LCA-HQ) and cholesterol as raw materials. Alpha-fetoprotein variants (AFP-L3) in serum from healthy people, liver disease and liver cancer patients were isolated using the prepared lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 were detected by fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Results The lectin polymer lipid magnetic sphere prepared in this study was superparamagnetic and encapsulated by a lectin derivative. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate of AFP-L3 between avidin magnetic ball-automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay and manual micro-affinity column method (p>0.05). We found that AFP-L3 can be used as a differential indicator between liver cancer and liver disease. The positive rate of AFP and AFP-L3 in liver cancer patients was higher than that in healthy people and liver disease patients (p<0.001). The AUC (95% CI) of AFP and AFP-L3 were 0.743  0.031 and 0.850  0.024, respectively. AFP-L3 AUC value is greater than AFP; therefore, AFP-L3 distinguishes liver cancer more accurately, and the difference is statistically different, p<0.05. Conclusion We proposed a novel method for integration of the lectin polymer lipid magnetic spheres and time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay that enables simple, accurate and rapid determination of AFP-L3 in clinical samples. To be noted, fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay compared with the commonly used techniques in clinical practice, the measurement procedure is simple and is expected to be used for the detection and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer.","output":"Automatic Time-Resolved Fluorescence Immunoassay of Serum Alpha Fetoprotein-L3 Variant via LCA Magnetic Cationic Polymeric Liposomes Improves the Diagnostic Accuracy of Liver Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian translation of the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-2 (SNAP-2) diagnostic scales, 837 Italian community-dwelling adults and 429 consecutively admitted Italian psychiatric adults were administered the SNAP-2.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the robustness of statistically significant findings from RCTs for COVID-19 using the fragility index. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included COVID-19 trial articles that randomly assigned patients 1:1 into 2 parallel groups and reported at least 1 binary outcome as significant in the abstract. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed to identify RCTs on COVID-19 published until August 7, 2021. EXPOSURES: Trial characteristics, such as type of intervention (treatment drug, vaccine, or others), number of outcome events, and sample size. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fragility index. RESULTS: Of the 47 RCTs for COVID-19 included, 36 (77%) were studies of the effects of treatment drugs, 5 (11%) were studies of vaccines, and 6 (13%) were of other interventions. A total of 138 235 participants were included in these trials. The median (IQR) fragility index of the included trials was 4 (1-11). The medians (IQRs) of the fragility indexes of RCTs of treatment drugs, vaccines, and other interventions were 2.5 (1-6), 119 (61-139), and 4.5 (1-18), respectively. The fragility index among more than half of the studies was less than 1% of each sample size, although the fragility index as a proportion of events needing to change would be much higher. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found a relatively small number of events (a median of 4) would be required to change the results of COVID-19 RCTs from statistically significant to not significant.

A Swedish isolate of PCV2 (S-PCV2) retrieved in 1993 from a healthy pig has been used in this model to reproduce PMWS in pigs from Northern Ireland. This virus has been present in the Swedish pig population for at least a decade without causing any known PMWS disease problems, despite its potential pathogenicity. The reasons for this are unknown, but could be related to genetics, absence of triggers for PCV2 upregulation (infectious agent and/or management forms) within Swedish pig husbandry. In order to confirm the pathogenicity of S-PCV2, Swedish and Danish pigs were experimentally infected with this isolate according to the established model. Swedish pigs were also infected with a reference isolate of PCV2 (PCV2-1010) to compare the severity of disease caused by the two isolates in Swedish pigs. Both Danish and Swedish pigs developed PMWS after the experimental infection with S-PCV2. Antibodies to PCV2 developed later and reached lower levels in serum from pigs infected with S-PCV2 than in pigs inoculated with PCV2-1010. In general, pigs infected with S-PCV2 showed more severe clinical signs of disease than pigs infected with PCV2-1010, but pigs from all PCV2-inoculated groups displayed gross and histological lesions consistent with PMWS. All pigs inoculated with PPV, alone or in combination with PCV2, displayed interleukin-10 responses in serum while only pigs infected with PPV in combination with PCV2 showed interferon- in serum on repeated occasions. Thus, the pathogenicity of S-PCV2 was confirmed and a role for cytokines in the etiology of PMWS was indicated.","output":"Experimental reproduction of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in pigs in Sweden and Denmark with a Swedish isolate of porcine circovirus type 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that causes novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major health problem worldwide and been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by WHO. One special population that poses a challenge is pregnant women with COVID-19. There have not been many studies related to COVID-19 in pregnancy. In this study, we present five serial cases of Remdesivir treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms. Case Illustration: We briefly describe five serial cases being treated with Remdesivir therapy during hospitalization. Four cases were delivered by cesarean section, and one was delivered vaginally in gestation week 37. All cases showed a shortened duration of hospitalization, rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, and no adverse events were observed in mothers, fetuses, and neonates. Discussion: Remdesivir, an inhibitor RNA Polymerase, has been used in COVID-19 treatment and is known to shorten recovery time in nonpregnant women. Some studies have shown no adverse effects on Remdesivir for pregnant women. Based on randomized control trial (RCT) during the Ebola epidemic, Remdesivir was safe to use for pregnant women. All cases showed reduced hospitalization time and better clinical outcomes without maternal, fetal, or neonatal adverse events. Conclusion: Remdesivir protocol for pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 has resulted in better clinical improvement with a shorter recovery period and no adverse effects during the hospitalization period.

The main factors taken into account in the economic assessment are excess mortality and lower productivity. METHODS: This study links three methodologies. First, we estimate the association between physical inactivity and workplace productivity using multivariable regression models with proprietary data on 120 143 individuals in the UK and six Asian countries (Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Sri Lanka). Second, we analyse the association between physical activity and mortality risk through a meta-regression analysis with data from 74 prior studies with global coverage. Finally, the estimated effects are combined in a computable general equilibrium macroeconomic model to project the economic benefits of physical activity over time. RESULTS: Doing at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, as per lower limit of the range recommended by the 2020 WHO guidelines, would lead to an increase in global gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.15%C0.24% per year by 2050, worth up to US$314C446 billion per year and US$6.0C8.6 trillion cumulatively over the 30-year projection horizon (in 2019 prices).

Some adolescents might be particularly vulnerable in this situation, including those who are deprived of psychological, social or health care services and/or are exposed to abuse or neglect in their home environment. The aims of the current international multicentre follow-up study are to: 1. collect data on the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after the pandemic; 2. improve their mental health by providing an online prevention program that addresses their actual needs; 3. accelerate the development of culturally adapted prevention programs by involving an international team, and 4. to contribute to adequate preparation for any potentially occurring, similar situationin the future. METHODS Participants aged 11-18 years and their parents/caregivers from diff erent parts of Europe and non-European countries are recruited online. Data are collected regularly in a follow-up study by means of structured self-administered online questionnaires on adolescents' mental health, quality of life and current attitudes and needs. The baseline data collection was in March 2020 at first restrictions of the COVID pandemic in Europe. It is followed up several times (at the beginning weekly, later monthly, bi-monthly, three-monthly) to study changes in mental health, quality of life and attitudes of children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease pandemic. Data were collected by means of structured questionnaires (see below). The time frame of the study is set to one year from study start, March 2021. The last data collection was done in December 2020. The prevention program is developed and provided based on continuously analysed incoming data. CONCLUSIONS Prevention based on the results of the study is expected to contribute to maintaining adolescents' mental health, improve their quality of life, increase their and their environment's cooperation with the necessary restrictions during the pandemic, and to make reintegration easier once the restrictions are over. Furthermore, the study has the potential to inform on the wellbeing of children and adolescents in extreme situations in general, thus contribute to future preventive measures and policymaking. Implications and Contribution: The proposed international online follow-up study is expected to provide scientifi c evidence for 1. possible changes in the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after a pandemic situation, 2. the eff ectiveness of a culturally adapted prevention program developed to address challenges associated with these changes.","output":"[Coronavirus Pandemic - #STAYHOME: How Are You Holding Up?

In particular, estimating the patient numbers and achieving an informed management of the dilemma are crucial in terms of the strategic decisions to be taken. The Covid-19 pandemic presents an important case in this context. Sustaining the efforts to cope with and to put an end to this pandemic requires investigation of the spread and infection mechanisms of the disease, and the factors which facilitate its spread. Covid-19 symptoms culminating in respiratory failure are known to cause death. Since air quality is one of the most significant factors in the progression of lung and respiratory diseases, it is aimed to estimate the number of Covid-19 patients corresponding to the pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO(2), NO(X), NO(2), CO, O(3)) after determining the relationship between air pollutant parameters and Covid-19 patient numbers in Turkey. For this purpose, artificial neural network was used to estimate the number of Covid-19 patients corresponding to air pollutant parameters in Turkey. To obtain highest accuracy levels in terms of network architecture structure, various network structures were tested. The optimal performance level was developed with 15 neurons combined with one hidden layer, which achieved a network performance level as high as 0.97342. It was concluded that Covid-19 disease is affected from air pollutant parameters and the number of patients can be estimated depending on these parameters by this study.

METHODS: We outline the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the CNS system, the effect of the virus in inducing catatonia, and its outcome. The literature used in the article is mostly case reports from different parts of the world thus; we have generalized our review taking into consideration multiple factors. RESULTS: In patients with COVID-19, neuropsychiatric manifestations are very commonly appreciated. Catatonia has been documented in many patients along with respiratory symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough. There are multiple etiologies associated with this presentation which have been discussed in detail in this article. In many patients, there was no history of any psychiatric illness. The timing of presenting with catatonic features was also different for different individuals. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been believed to contribute to the presentation of catatonia. There is no specific timeline between the onset of symptoms and the presence of COVID-19 infection. However, coronavirus can be responsible in a few ways for inducing catatonia in patients with or without any previous psychiatric illness. Therefore, COVID-19 should be considered as one of the major factors in this complex psychiatric disease, catatonia.","output":"Covid-19 Induced Catatonia: A Review Of This Rare Phenomenon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the introduction of smallpox vaccination more than two centuries ago, vaccines have beenand still areinstrumental in the prevention of infectious diseases.

While there is a spectrum of disease severity and presenting symptoms in infected patients, hypoxemic respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. Decision to intubate in rapidly deteriorating patients plays a significant role in determining patient outcome. In most patients, COVID-19 pneumonia initially causes worsening hypoxemia but minimal impairment of lung compliance which determines the work of breathing (WOB). Once adequate arterial oxygenation is established, a tool to determine WOB independent of oxygen needs can guide the decision to intubate for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We monitored oxygen requirements and WOB in 14 patients admitted to our ICU with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients had radiographic evidence of extensive lung disease, significant hypoxemia and multiple comorbidities. Hypoxemia was managed through non-invasive means, predominantly using highflow nasal cannula. To assess WOB, we used a scale developed by us assigning points to the respiratory rate and use of respiratory accessory muscles (range, 1 to 7) (Figure 1a). This was used at the time of initial evaluation and throughout the ICU stay. Out of 14 patients, 10 did not require intubation and recovered while 4 were intubated. We compared the maximum and average WOB of the non-intubated patients throughout their ICU stay with the WOB of intubated patients measured within 24 hours before intubation (Figure 1b). The maximal and the average WOB were higher in patients requiring intubation (mean  SD, maximal 4.3  0.9 vs 5.5  1.0 pts, p = 0.028 and average 2.7  0.6 vs 3.9  0.5 pts, p = 0.002). Breakdown of the various WOB components demonstrated a statistically significantly higher maximal and average use of respiratory accessory muscles (assessed as their aggregate sum) and higher average respiratory rate in intubated patients. However, the maximal respiratory rate was not significantly higher. Our data illustrates the initial response to COVID-19 lung injury is tachypnea which can be sustained with adequate oxygenation. As lung injury progresses with more recruitment of respiratory accessory muscles, intubation for IMV becomes necessary. Our WOB scale becomes a useful tool to assist in the decision of when to intubate. It is simple to teach, apply and incorporate into routine patient assessment. We recommend routine and systematic WOB assessment to plan for orderly nonemergent intubations for IMV. Further refinement on the interventions recommended based on specific WOB level and other modifying factors is awaited.","output":"COVID-19 pneumonia: Guiding the decision to intubate based on independent assessment of oxygenation and work of breathing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental transmission of viruses to humans has become an early warning for potential epidemic outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus outbreaks.

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. The data were collected through one-to-one, semistructured interviews and analysed through the framework of thematic analysis. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study was conducted from December 2019 to May 2020 at one general intensive care unit (ICU) and one emergency ICU in a general tertiary hospital with 3200 beds in Hangzhou, China. The sampling strategy was combined maximum variation sampling and criterion sampling. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians participated in the study. The reason why critical care clinicians implemented physical restraints to prevent unplanned extubation was that the tense healthcare climate was caused by family members rejection of mismatched expectations. As unplanned extubation was highly likely to create medical disputes, hospitals placed excessive emphasis on unplanned extubation, which resulted in a lack of analysis of the cause of unplanned extubation and strict measures for dealing with unplanned extubation. The shortage of nursing human resources, unsuitable ward environments, intensivists attitudes, timely extubation for intensivists, nurse experiences and the patients possibility of unplanned extubation all contributed to the decision-making resulting in the use of physical restraints. CONCLUSIONS: Although nurses played a crucial role in the decision-making process of using physical restraints, changing the healthcare climate and the hospital management mode for unplanned extubation are fundamental measures to reduce physical restraints use.","output":"Why are physical restraints still in use?

Pestivirus particles contain three glycosylated envelope proteins, E(rns), E1, and E2. Among them, E1 is the least characterized concerning both biochemical features and function. E1 from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain CP7 was analyzed with regard to its intracellular localization and membrane topology. Here, it is shown that even in the absence of other viral proteins, E1 is not secreted or expressed at the cell surface but localizes predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using engineered chimeric transmembrane domains with sequences from E1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, the E1 ER-retention signal could be narrowed down to six fully conserved polar residues in the middle part of the transmembrane domain of E1. Retention was observed even when several of these polar residues were exchanged for alanine. Mutations with a strong impact on E1 retention prevented recovery of infectious viruses when tested in the viral context. Analysis of the membrane topology of E1 before and after the signal peptide cleavage via a selective permeabilization and an in vivo labeling approach revealed that mature E1 is a typical type I transmembrane protein with a single span transmembrane anchor at its C terminus, whereas it adopts a hairpin-like structure with the C terminus located in the ER lumen when the precleavage situation is mimicked by blocking the cleavage site between E1 and E2. IMPORTANCE The shortage of specific antibodies against E1, making detection and further analysis of E1 difficult, resulted in a lack of knowledge on E1 compared to E(rns) and E2 with regard to biosynthesis, structure, and function. It is known that pestiviruses bud intracellularly. Here, we show that E1 contains its own ER retention signal: six fully conserved polar residues in the middle part of the transmembrane domain are shown to be the determinants for ER retention of E1. Moreover, those six polar residues could serve as a functional group that intensely affect the generation of infectious viral particles. In addition, the membrane topology of E1 has been determined. In this context, we also identified dynamic changes in membrane topology of E1 with the carboxy terminus located on the luminal side of the ER in the precleavage state and relocation of this sequence upon signal peptidase cleavage. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of the pestiviral E1 protein with regard to its biochemical and functional characteristics.","output":"Characterization of Membrane Topology and Retention Signal of Pestiviral Glycoprotein E1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in 3 districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines.

In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination.

The World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 current guidelines recommend corticosteroids administration in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Herein, we report a case series of seven patients with COVID-19; three mild, three moderate, and one severe, from Lahore, Pakistan; all were using corticosteroids for managing their early mild symptoms of COVID-19 at home for around 2C3 weeks without a physicians advise, presented, and admitted with ROCM to Mayo hospital, Lahore, from March to June 2021. Out of the seven patients, five patients had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) as comorbidity. Eye pain, facial swelling and pain, nasal blockage, and black coloration around eyes, on palate, and oral mucosa were the presenting complaints at the time of admission. All the patients had radiographic imaging, including computed tomography (CT), paranasal sinuses (PNS), or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carried out at the hospital, which confirmed mucosal thickening and adjacent sinus bony erosions with intracranial extension. All the patients were treated with local debridement of the infected necrotic tissue along with intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B and Posaconazole or Amphotericin B depending on the case. Due to timely management, in six out of seven patients, prognosis was good due to early diagnosis and treatment, while one patient with severe COVID-19 illness deteriorated and died. The misuse of corticosteroids for managing early mild symptoms of COVID-19 in diabetic and other immunocompromised patients can lead to fatal ROCM, which can further increase their risk of developing severe COVID-19 and mortality. It is stressed that only physicians recommended therapeutic advice should be followed for managing early mild symptoms of COVID-19 in self-isolation and avoid the unnecessary use of corticosteroids. This case series also emphasizes that COVID-19 diabetic patients treated with corticosteroids need more vigilant monitoring and high suspicion of early diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infection.

It has been used extensively to describe the molecular epidemiology and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the origins and subsequent evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SCoV), and, more recently, the evolving epidemiology of avian influenza as well as seasonal and pandemic human influenza viruses. Recent advances in phylogenetic methods can infer more in-depth information about the patterns of virus emergence, adding to the conventional approaches in viral epidemiology. Examples of this information include estimations (with confidence limits) of the actual time of the origin of a new viral strain or its emergence in a new species, viral recombination and reassortment events, the rate of population size change in a viral epidemic, and how the virus spreads and evolves within a specific population and geographical region. Such sequence-derived information obtained from the phylogenetic tree can assist in the design and implementation of public health and therapeutic interventions. However, application of many of these advanced phylogenetic methods are currently limited to specialized phylogeneticists and statisticians, mainly because of their mathematical basis and their dependence on the use of a large number of computer programs. This review attempts to bridge this gap by presenting conceptual, technical, and practical aspects of applying phylogenetic methods in studies of influenza, HIV, and SCoV. It aims to provide, with minimal mathematics and statistics, a practical overview of how phylogenetic methods can be incorporated into virological studies by clinical and laboratory specialists.","output":"Use of phylogenetics in the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary studies of viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the hedging and safe-haven properties of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for emerging stock market (ESM) indices.

We investigate whether the timing of disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing strategy of the retailer. We derive the optimal pricing strategy and ordering levels with both disruption timing and product substitution. By exploring both the Nash and Stackelberg games, we find that the order quantity with the disrupted supplier depends on price leadership and it tends to increase when the non-disrupted supplier is the leader. Moreover, the equilibrium market retail prices are higher under higher levels of disruption for the Nash game, compared to the Stackelberg game. We also uncover that the non-disruptive supplier can always charge the highest wholesale price if the disruption occurs before orders are received. This highlights the critical role of order timing.

Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. RESULTS Mean age was 66.0  8.1 years and 97.6% of the patients were men. Mean SVG age was 11.1  0.4 years. First-generation DES were sirolimus-eluting (n = 17) and paclitaxel-eluting (n = 64) stents. Second-generation DES were everolimus-eluting (n = 115) and zotarolimus-eluting (n = 51) stents. Median follow-up was 41 months. At 2-years post-procedure, patients with first- and second-generation DES had similar rates of death (20.91% vs. 20.27%, P = 0.916), target lesion revascularization (16.39% vs. 20.00%, P = 0.572), target vessel revascularization (20.97% vs. 23.16%, P = 0.747), myocardial infarction (26.15% vs. 23.00%, P = 0.644), and MACE (43.5% vs. 40.87%, P = 0.707), respectively.

METHODS We performed a descriptive, retrospective, 6-month study of all patients who underwent laser therapies, at an accredited regional burn center, to improve the vascularity, texture, thickness, and stiffness of symptomatic burn scars. Data regarding skin type, mechanism, area treated, and laser parameters were collected. Main outcome measures included pigmentation changes, blistering, rash, infection.  analysis and Student t test were used to evaluate associations between variables. RESULTS A total of 95 patients underwent 163 treatment sessions (mean, 2.7 sessions/patient) with pulsed dye laser (71%), CO2 laser (22%), and other lasers (7%). Forty-one adverse events were recorded: hyperpigmentation (2%), hypopigmentation (12%), mild blistering (27%), pain (37%), rash (7%), fever (10%), and infection (2%). Patients with scald burns were more likely to develop blistering, rash, and fever after treatment (all P < 0.05).

Research involving patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated with tocilizumab and compared with the standard of care (SOC) was included in this study. We conducted a systematic review to find data about the risks and benefits of tocilizumab and outcomes from different baseline criteria for administration of tocilizumab as a treatment for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 26 studies, consisting of 23 retrospective studies, one prospective study, and two randomised controlled trials with 2112 patients enrolled in the tocilizumab group and 6160 patients in the SOC group, were included in this meta-analysis.

METHODS: Dust mite-allergic adults with mild asthma underwent inhalation challenge with Dermatophagoides farinae. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), induced sputum and peripheral blood samples were obtained pre- and 24 h post-challenge. Spirometry was performed before and throughout the challenge at 10-min intervals, and allergen responsiveness was defined by a 20% fall in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Sputum samples were analyzed for inflammatory cells, cytokines and chemokines. Multiple linear regression was employed to test the association between sputum IL-1 concentration and biomarkers of T helper type 2 (T2)-dominant inflammation. RESULTS: Fourteen volunteers underwent inhaled allergen challenge. Allergen responsive volunteers showed a greater positive change in IL-1 in sputum following allergen challenge compared to non-responders. Higher pre-challenge sputum IL-1 was associated with greater increase in sputum IL-5 (p = 0.004), sputum eosinophils (p = 0.001) and blood IL-5 (p = 0.003) following allergen challenge.

For the SJTs, respondents saw hypothetical scenarios on these themes and had to indicate how they would react. The objective is to give an impression of beliefs and norms on specific behaviors, which provide insights for social and behavior change interventions. Data was collected by enumerators traveling to villages randomly selected in six districts of the country. The sample is composed of 566 respondents. Results show that FGM in particular seem to be a priority topic, in comparison to the other topics for which the norms seem to be stronger against those practices. Age differences emerged and suggest priority groups to be targeted (e.g., on the topic of female genital mutilation, younger female respondents, and older male respondents gave the lowest coded responses which reflected to less appropriate behavior in our coding). In terms of validity of the measurement methods, situational judgment test answers correlated positively with other items in the survey, but the magnitude of the association is often small, and sometimes not significant. Thus, more studies are needed to further explore the validity of this measure by comparing against a reference value.

CONCLUSIONS: Some participants reported very personal perceptions and deficits of the healthcare system, especially when caring for COVID-19 patients. Uniform interdisciplinary guidelines for symptom control, more education, and support by trained staff confident in symptom control should be increasingly considered in the future.","output":"Wahrnehmungen zum Umgang mit Opioiden: Fokus COVID-19: Freitext-Analyse einer Umfrage in An?sthesiologie/Intensivmedizin, Innerer Medizin und Palliativmedizin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a major negative impact on public mental health particularly among health care workers. Alcohol use is a common maladaptive response to stress that is associated with adverse health consequences and that could impair productivity in the workplace for the health workforce. The aim of this study is to document the burden and factors associated with harmful alcohol use among health care workers at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Methods: : This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from a parent online survey that investigated the prevalence and factors associated with mental disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Analyses for this study were conducted to examine the burden and factors associated with harmful alcohol use among a sub-group of 887 participants who completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire. Results: : Three hundred and eighty nine (43.9%) participants reported harmful alcohol use. The factors significantly associated with increased odds of endorsing harmful alcohol use were: being male (AOR= 1.56;95% CI=1.14, 2.14;p=0.006), being not married (AOR= 2.06;95% CI=1.48, 2.89;p<0.001), having 11-20 years of experience as compared to having 20+ years of experience (AOR= 1.91;95% CI=1.18, 3.12;p=0.009), and being a specialist (AOR=2.78;CI=1.64, 4.78;P=<0.001) or doctor (AOR= 2.82;95% CI=1.74, 4.63;p<0.001) as compared to being a nurse. Conclusions: : A high proportion of health care workers reported harmful alcohol use at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Males, the unmarried, those with 11-20 years of experience in the health field, doctors and specialists were more likely to report harmful alcohol use. These findings highlight the need to institute interventions for harmful alcohol use targeting these groups of health care workers in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Harmful Alcohol Use Among Healthcare Workers at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Point-of-care lung ultrasound is a widely used tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with pulmonary diseases and now with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression. Results: A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p <0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation. Conclusions: The ongoing outbreak of KD in the Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS and African ancestry.","output":"Outbreak of Kawasaki disease in children during COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective observational study in Paris, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak, called COVID-19, has destabilized the worldwide economy The evolution of the disease and therewith the measures taken by each of the goverments has affected local economies in an uncertain way, and a priori to the facts, measures have been taken to keep safe one of the most affected sectors such as the tourism In order to learn about the measures taken by the governments of Colombia and Ecuador, this document analyses the governmental provisions of each country for the sector In this way, it will be determined whether or not the strategies of each country where correct to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic ? 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao All rights reserved","output":"Analysis of the measures taken by the governments of Colombia and Ecuador in favor of the tourism industry during the pandemic generated by covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spa tourism has been experiencing over the last decades significant changes in its nature Supply and demand have changed in recent years, impacting on the function of thermal centers in general, and on the use of their base resource, mineral-medicinal water, in particular Recently, this productive sector has been forced to resituate itself due to the unexpected outbreak of the Covid pandemic whose impacts on the sector are still to be fully calibrated, although it has already halted a large part of economic activity and global flows of people and goods The present investigation examines the function and potential that spas have as health agents In the case of Spain, this research note reflects on the opportunities, for a repositioning of this activity in the tourist dynamics that arise during and after a period of crisis","output":"Spa tourism opportunities as strategic sector in aiding recovery from Covid-19: The Spanish model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In accordance with the International Labour Organizations Maternity Protection Convention (No. 183) and European Union Directive 92/857CEE (1992), Switzerlands Labour Law and its Maternity Protection Ordinance (OProMa) aim to protect the health of pregnant employees and their future children while enabling them to pursue their working activities. Gynaecologists-obstetricians have a key role in this legislation, particularly through the prescription of preventive leave for patients who would otherwise face dangerous or arduous tasks in the absence of an adequate risk analysis or suitable protective measures. However, international and national literature suggests that gynaecologists-obstetricians may encounter difficulties in fulfilling their role. AIMS This study aimed to: (1) describe the practices and difficulties encountered by gynaecologists-obstetricians in the practical implementation of the OProMa; and (2) compare the evolution of these practices and difficulties between 2008 and 2017. METHODS A survey by questionnaire was conducted in 2008 and repeated in 2017. Both surveys focused on gynaecologists-obstetricians working in the French-speaking part of Switzerland (in private practices, hospitals or both). Descriptive and comparative analyses were carried out. RESULTS 83 gynaecologists-obstetricians responded in 2008 and 93 in 2017: response rates of 47% and 32%, respectively. In 2017, gynaecologists-obstetricians were more likely to ask questions about occupational risks faced by their patients when consulted by working mothers about their pregnancies. The estimated percentage of patients exposed to an occupational risk remained constant (20% in 2008 and 22% in 2017). Communication and collaboration with employers were reported to be difficult in both surveys, even though these are key elements in the implementation of the OProMa. Collaboration with occupational physicians, however, was more frequent in 2017. CONCLUSION In 2017, gynaecologists-obstetricians showed a greater awareness of occupational risks and collaborated more frequently with occupational health specialists. However, the application of the OProMa remained limited over the studied time period. Improving training of gynaecologists-obstetricians in this field could be a significant factor in encouraging better implementation of the current legislation. Moreover, gynaecologists-obstetricians need to be given the necessary support to enable their clinical practice to evolve towards a more preventive type of medicine. Collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including occupational physicians, midwives and workers, should be encouraged.","output":"Evolution of gynaecologists' practices regarding the implementation of Swiss legislation on maternity protection at work between 2008 and 2017."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper compares and contrasts the spread and impact of COVID-19 in the three countries most heavily impacted by the pandemic: the United States (US), India and Brazil. All three of these countries have a federal structure, in which the individual states have largely determined the response to the pandemic. Thus, we perform an extensive analysis of the individual states of these three countries to determine patterns of similarity within each. First, we analyse structural similarity and anomalies in the trajectories of cases and deaths as multivariate time series. Next, we study the lengths of the different waves of the virus outbreaks across the three countries and their states. Finally, we investigate suitable time offsets between cases and deaths as a function of the distinct outbreak waves. In all these analyses, we consistently reveal more characteristically distinct behaviour between US and Indian states, while Brazilian states exhibit less structure in their wave behaviour and changing progression between cases and deaths.","output":"Comparing the dynamics of COVID-19 infection and mortality in the United States, India, and Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promising therapy is needed for treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) to overcome current treatment that inefficient and associated with unnecessary health risks. Recently, the concept of incorporating natural products into nanocarriers has been intended as a promising therapy for treating IBD via modulating their stability and bioavailability. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential alleviating effects of dietary nano-supplement combined with bacillus strains (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; BANPs) in colitis model. Rats were orally gavaged by 5% DSS and the efficacy and mechanistic actions of BANPs were evaluated by assessing the severity of clinical signs and inflammatory and apoptosis response, histopathological and immunohistochemistry examination in colonic tissues. The severity of clinical signs was successfully alleviated and fecal Lcn-2 levels, an important colitic marker, were decreased in BANPs then free BA treated groups. In contrast, inflammatory markers overexpression IL-6, IL-1, TNF, COX-2, and iNOS in the colitic group were reduced more prominently in BANPs treated group, unlike free BA. The amelioration of BANPs to colon injury was also correlated with oxidative stress suppression along with restoring total antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, BANPs treatment modulated apoptotic markers as proved by downregulation of cytochrome c, and caspase-3 and upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bax than free BA. The severity of the histopathological alterations in the colon was greatly reduced in BANPs than free BA groups. Remarkably, over-expression of ki67 and IL-6 in colonic tissues were suppressed in BANPs group. These findings together highlighted the beneficial efficacy of BANPs in IBD treatment which are evidenced by colonic inflammation alleviation. Taken together, these results recommend that BANPs is a promising agent that encourages its possible therapeutic role in colitis treatment.","output":"Probiotics-loaded nanoparticles attenuated colon inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in colitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The confluence of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 disease during Fall 2020 will give rise to considerable morbidity and mortality, likely stressing the U.S. healthcare system. Firefighter/paramedic first responders are at risk of being exposed to pathogens such as coronavirus and the avian flu, that can be transmitted between the patients they serve. We estimate influenza vaccination rates by coronavirus infection status in one large metropolitan Florida career fire department. Methods: We used a cross-sectional study design to estimate flu vaccination prevalence among all frontline firefighter/paramedic workers from a fire department participating in a seroprevalence study. Participants initially provided consent and completed a 76-item web-based survey. Seasonal influenza vaccination was assessed in the 12-months prior to coronavirus testing. Off- and on-duty firefighters/paramedics were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined lateral flow immunoassay during April/May 2020. Results: Among the 1,555 participating firefighters/paramedics, 8.5% reported receipt of the seasonal flu vaccine, and 4.1% tested SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. None of the antibody-positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to those who tested negative (0.0% vs. 8.5%;p=0.012). After controlling for potential confounders, firefighters/paramedics who were Hispanic/Latino vs non-Hispanic/Latino (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval=0.20C0.55]), former smokers vs never smokers (AOR:0.47 [0.24-0.93]), and had one or more chronic conditions vs no chronic diseases(AOR:0.33 [0.15-0.75]) were significantly less likely to report seasonal influenza vaccine receipt. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination rates were very low among frontline firefighters/paramedics in a large Florida fire department.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to a high risk of occupational infection, partially due to insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. This study aimed to describe the practices, availability, training, confidence in PPE use and the adverse effects due to extended PPE use, as reported by HCWs in Italy. We also aimed to provide a comparison between Italian data and those from other countries. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a previously published international study, the PPE-SAFE Survey, conducted in April 2020. Data were analysed from the original study database. RESULTS: We analysed the responses from 380 healthcare workers based in Italy, out of the 2711 respondents to the international survey. Among the Italian respondents, FFP2 and FFP3 respirators or equivalent were the most used masks for routine tasks (respectively 188/380, 50%; and 163/380, 43%). The median time of wearing PPE without taking a break was 5 h [interquartile range (IQR) 4C6], with statistically significant difference from other countries [median 4 h (IQR 2C5) p < 0.0001]. In Italy, 249 out of 380 (65%) HCWs had never performed a formal fit test for a N95 mask or equivalent and 91/380 (24%) never had a partner for donning and doffing procedures. Most of the respondents (299/380, 79%) had received formal training in PPE use at any time. CONCLUSION: Most of the surveyed Italian HCWs reported working at above usual capacity, long shifts with PPE without breaks and routine use in intensive care unit of aerosol protection (e.g. FFP2/FFP3), hazmat suits and face shields/visors. The correct adherence to safety procedures (e.g. donning/doffing in pairs, performing fit test) has substantial scope for improvement in the future.","output":"Personal protective equipment use by healthcare workers in intensive care unit during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: a secondary analysis of the PPE-SAFE survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often requires controlled ventilation, yielding high mechanical power and possibly further injury. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) can be used as a bridge to recovery, however, if this fails the end result is destroyed lung parenchyma. This condition is fatal and the only remaining alternative is lung transplantation. In the case study presented in this paper, lung transplantation was not an option given the critically ill state and the presence of HLA antibodies. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may be valuable in ARDS, but APRV settings recommended in various patient and clinical studies are inconsistent. The Time Controlled Adaptive Ventilation (TCAV?) method is the most studied technique to set and adjust the APRV mode and uses an extended continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Phase in combination with a very brief Release Phase. In addition, the TCAV? method settings are personalized and adaptive based on changes in lung pathophysiology. We used the TCAV? method in a case of severe ARDS, which enabled us to open, stabilize and slowly heal the severely damaged lung parenchyma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old woman presented with Staphylococcus Aureus necrotizing pneumonia. Progressive respiratory failure necessitated invasive mechanical ventilation and VV-ECMO. Mechanical ventilation (MV) was ultimately discontinued because lung protective settings resulted in trivial tidal volumes. She was referred to our academic transplant center for bilateral lung transplantation after the remaining infection had been cleared. We initiated the TCAV? method in order to stabilize the lung parenchyma and to promote tissue recovery. This strategy was challenged by the presence of a large bronchopleural fistula, however, APRV enabled weaning from VV-ECMO and mechanical ventilation. After two months, following nearly complete surgical closure of the remaining bronchopleural fistulas, the patient was readmitted to ICU where she had early postoperative complications. Since other ventilation modes resulted in significant atelectasis and hypercapnia, APRV was restarted. The patient was then again weaned from MV. CONCLUSIONS: The TCAV? method can be useful to wean challenging patients with severe ARDS and might contribute to lung recovery. In this particular case, a lung transplantation was circumvented.","output":"Time controlled adaptive ventilation? as conservative treatment of destroyed lung: an alternative to lung transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 is a new viral infection that has a significant impact on global health and economy.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. CASES: We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). DISCUSSION: The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","output":"Delirium in COVID-19: A case series and exploration of potential mechanisms for central nervous system involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Body mass index (BMI) at child and adolescent ages is positively associated with adult coronary heart disease (CHD) whereas height at these ages may be inversely associated with CHD.

They exert these effects by modulating the gut microbial composition and dynamics. In the present study, we performed a comparative whole metagenome shotgun sequencing analysis (WMGS) to elucidate the gut microbiota and secretary Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) dynamics as a result of 5% (w/w) FOS supplementation over a period of 7 days (fecal samples were collected every day). A number of taxa including Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Clostridia, Faecalibaculum, and Enterorhabdus were found to be modulated with SIgA production in the murine gut. The process of SIgA production from FOS metabolization was found to be carried out via the production of short-chain fatty acids in the gut. Species of Bacteroides and Roseburia; namely, B. caccae, B. finegoldii, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotamicron, and Roseburia intestinalis, respectively, are predominantly responsible for FOS metabolization in the murine gut. The abundances of these bacterial species and their corresponding functions involved in FOS metabolization decreased over time even though these prebiotics were administered continuously for seven days. This suggests that there is a decrease in FOS metabolization over time. In addition, the present analysis suggests that the administration of FOS may help to reduce the pathogenic bacteria from the gut via SIgA production.

Their goals are to improve management of the older cancer patients through education, dedicated resources and guidelines and to raise awareness on their specific needs and requirements. Therefore, the WG initiated a survey to describe the practice patterns worldwide. Methods: All ESMO and SIOG members received a request by email to complete the survey online on 17 Feb 2020 with subsequent reminders. Questions were focused on clinical practices, perception of geriatric oncology (GO), use of screening tools such as geriatric-8 (G8), education and knowledge of guidelines. The survey was closed on 5 Apr 2020. Results: A total of 168 participants fully completed the survey. Most of them were female (65%), aged 30-39 (58%), medical oncologists (70%) and from Europe (50%). Professionals predominantly in charge of front-line care of older patients with cancer were medical oncologists (68%);however, only 19% had a physician coordinating a GO programme at their institution. According to respondents, GO brings to oncology: detection of frailty (83%), prediction of toxicity (77%), integrative management (70%), improving older patients understanding of treatment and adherence (64%), providing practice guidelines (46%) and prediction of survival (41%). Most of the respondents (95%) felt the need for other scales than ECOG Performance Status, 66% knew about the G8 scale and 52% used it in their clinical practice. Non-SIOG members were significantly less aware of the G8 screening tool (56% vs 97% for SIOG members;p<0.001) and less prone to use it in clinical practice (50% vs 61% for SIOG members;p=0.002). G8 use (or knowledge) was not affected by place of work nor region of the world. Finally, 76% felt that all oncologists should be geriatric oncologists and 96% that they needed more information and education in GO. Conclusions: The care of older patients with cancer is very heterogeneous. Despite the low number of responses, probably affected by the first lockdown of COVID-19 pandemic, there is a clear need for training in GO and information about the screening tools.

Various methods have been developed to construct such networks, using for example a multiple sequence alignment or multiple phylogenetic trees as input data. Coronaviruses are known to recombine frequently, but rooted phylogenetic networks have not yet been used extensively to describe their evolutionary history. Here, we created a workflow to compare the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like viruses using several rooted phylogenetic network inference algorithms. This workflow includes filtering noise from sets of phylogenetic trees by contracting edges based on branch length and bootstrap support, followed by resolution of multifurcations. We explored the running times of the network inference algorithms, the impact of filtering on the properties of the produced networks, and attempted to derive biological insights regarding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from them. RESULTS: The network inference algorithms are capable of constructing rooted phylogenetic networks for coronavirus data, although running-time limitations require restricting such datasets to a relatively small number of taxa. Filtering generally reduces the number of reticulations in the produced networks and increases their temporal consistency. Taxon bat-SL-CoVZC45 emerges as a major and structural source of discordance in the dataset. The tested algorithms often indicate that SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13 is a tree-like clade, with possibly some reticulate activity further back in their history. A smaller number of constructed networks posit SARS-CoV-2 as a possible recombinant, although this might be a methodological artefact arising from the interaction of bat-SL-CoVZC45 discordance and the optimization criteria used. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that as part of a wider workflow and with careful attention paid to running time, rooted phylogenetic network algorithms are capable of producing plausible networks from coronavirus data. These networks partly corroborate existing theories about SARS-CoV-2, and partly produce new avenues for exploration regarding the location and significance of reticulate activity within the wider group of SARS-like viruses. Our workflow may serve as a model for pipelines in which phylogenetic network algorithms can be used to analyse different datasets and test different hypotheses.","output":"Applicability of several rooted phylogenetic network algorithms for representing the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is highly likely that COVID-19 will result in a drain on hospitals financial resources, not the least of which being cash Not all hospitals are financially prepared for any enduring loss of cash, with hospitals in few states being well prepared Those states that have experienced early cases of COVID-19 are less well prepared financially Several policy options merit consideration","output":"Hospital financial preparedness and covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The competencies to be achieved in the Real Analysis course are 1) prove simple math statements with familiar concepts and 2) develop critical, creative, structured, and systematically thinking skills This competence can be improved by using flow proof-based teaching materials and direct interaction in class between lecturers and students During the Covid-19 pandemic, direct interaction in class was replaced with online learning Of course, online interactions will affect student learning outcomes What are the factors that affect student learning outcomes in real analysis lectures during the Covid-19 pandemic?

It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities.

We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB.

Nonetheless, since 2005, the US FDA has received more than 100 reports of microcatheter breakage or entrapment related to Onyx embolization, including 9 deaths. In 2014, the Apollo detachable-tip microcatheter became the first of its kind available in the US. Since then, few reports on its safety have been published.METHODSThe authors conducted a retrospective review of endovascular cases by searching the patient databases at 2 tertiary cerebrovascular centers (Barrow Neurological Institute and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center). Patients who underwent endovascular embolization of an AVM or AVF using the Apollo microcatheter were identified. Patient demographics and lesion characteristics were collected. The authors analyzed Apollo-specific endovascular variables, such as number of microcatheterizations, sessions, and pedicles embolized; microcatheter tip detachment status; obliteration rate; and endovascular- and microcatheter-related morbidity and mortality.RESULTSFrom July 2014 to October 2016, a total of 177 embolizations using the Apollo microcatheter were performed in 61 patients (mean age 40.3 years). The most frequent presentation was hemorrhage (22/61, 36.1%). Most lesions were AVMs (51/61, 83.6%; mean diameter 30.6 mm). The mean Spetzler-Martin grade was 2.4. Thirty-nine (76.5%) of 51 patients with AVMs underwent resection. Microcatheterization was successful in 172 pedicles. Most patients (50/61, 82%) underwent a single embolization session. The mean number of pedicles per session was 2.5 (range 1-7). Onyx-18 was used in 103 (59.9%), N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in 44 (25.6%), and Onyx-34 in 25 (14.5%) of the 172 embolizations. In 45.9% (28/61) of the patients, lesion obliteration of 75% or greater was achieved. Tip detachment occurred in 19.2% (33/172) of microcatheters. Fifty-three (86.9%) of the 61 patients who underwent embolization with the Apollo microcatheter had good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). No unintended microcatheter fractures or related morbidity was observed. One patient died of intraprocedural complications unrelated to microcatheter selection. In the univariate analysis, microcatheter tip detachment (p = 0.12), single embolized pedicles (p = 0.12), and smaller AVM nidus diameter (p = 0.17) correlated positively with high obliteration rates (> 90%). In the multivariate analysis, microcatheter tip detachment was the only independent variable associated with high obliteration rates (OR 9.5; p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONSThe use of the Apollo detachable-tip microcatheter for embolization of AVMs and AVFs is associated with high rates of successful catheterization and obliteration and low rates of morbidity and mortality. The microcatheter was retrieved in all cases, even after prolonged injections in distal branch pedicles, often with significant reflux. This study represents the largest case series on the application of the Apollo microcatheter for neurointerventional procedures.","output":"Use of the Apollo detachable-tip microcatheter for endovascular embolization of arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study discusses new legislative anti-crisis solutions adopted in Poland in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic The Polish legislator decided to introduce the so-called simplified restructuring procedure This happened in the face of the expectations of both the jurisprudence of law and practice On the one hand, the simplified restructuring procedure (the fifth independent type of restructuring procedure for an entrepreneur in Poland) allows for a quick, cheap and simplified conclusion of an arrangement with creditors outside the court, then approved by the court On the other hand, the opening of such proceedings gives the debtor protection against enforcement at the creditor's request and against bankruptcy at the creditor's request This procedure can be a testing ground for the concept of informalisation and acceleration of restructuring procedures ? 2020 Rafa?

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess rates of depressive and subthreshold depressive symptomatology, and the characteristics associated, among older adults living in a socioeconomically deprived area of Brazil. METHODS This study is part of the PROACTIVE cluster randomised controlled trial. 3,356 adults aged 60+ years and registered in 20 primary health clinics were screened for depressive symptomatology with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9). Depressive status was classified according to the total PHQ-9 score and the presence of core depressive symptoms (depressed mood and anhedonia) as follows: no depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 score 0-4, or 5-9 but with no core depressive symptom); subthreshold depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 score 5-9 and at least one core depressive symptom); and depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 score  10). Sociodemographic information and self-reported chronic conditions were collected. Relative risk ratios (RRR) and 95% CIs were obtained using a multinomial regression model. RESULTS Depressive and subthreshold depressive symptomatology were present in 30% and 14% of the screened sample. Depressive symptomatology was associated with female gender, low socioeconomic conditions and presence of chronic conditions, whereas subthreshold depressive symptomatology was only associated with female gender and having hypertension.

We found that the two genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 orf8 are capable of inducing ER stress without significant difference by triggering the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzymes 1 (IRE1) branches of the ER stress pathway. However, the third branch of ER stress pathway, i.e. the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), was unaffected by the overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 orf8L or orf8S.

Severe forms of the disease are associated with a thrombo-inflammatory state that can turn into thrombosis. Because tissue factor (TF) conveyed by extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been implicated in thrombosis, we quantified the EV-TF activity in a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 111) and evaluated its link with inflammation, disease severity, and thrombotic events. Patients with severe disease were compared with those who had moderate disease and with patients who had septic shock not related to COVID-19 (n = 218). The EV-TF activity was notably increased in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with that observed in patients with moderate COVID-19 (median, 231 [25th to 75th percentile, 39-761] vs median, 25 [25th to 75th percentile, 12-59] fM; P < .0001); EV-TF was correlated with leukocytes, D-dimer, and inflammation parameters. High EV-TF values were associated with an increased thrombotic risk in multivariable models. Compared with patients who had septic shock, those with COVID-19 were characterized by a distinct coagulopathy profile with significantly higher EV-TF and EV-fibrinolytic activities that were not counterbalanced by an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Thus, this article is the first to describe the dissemination of extreme levels of EV-TF in patients with severe COVID-19, which supports the international recommendations of systematic preventive anticoagulation in hospitalized patients and potential intensification of anticoagulation in patients with severe disease.","output":"Dissemination of extreme levels of extracellular vesicles: tissue factor activity in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A COVID19 lockdown in India posed significant challenges to the continuation of radiotherapy (RT) and systemic therapy services.

Data was collected for the period of lockdown on outpatient visits, starting, and delivery of RT and systemic therapy. Adherence to protocol was audited, and factors affecting change from pre-COVID standards analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: Outpatient consults dropped by 58%. Planned RT starts were implemented in 90%, 100%, 92%, 90% and 75% of priority level 1-5 patients. While 17% had a deferred start, the median time to start of adjuvant RT and overall treatment times were maintained. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 89% of those eligible. Systemic therapy was administered to 84.5% of planned patients with 33% and 57% of curative and palliative patients receiving modified or deferred cycles. The patients inability to come was the commonest reason for RT or ST deviation.

Methods: Among patients from a large neuroscience institute in Hawaii, vaccine hesitancy was investigated in relation to over 30 sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities, via a telephone quality improvement survey conducted between 23 January 2021 and 13 February 2021. Results: Vaccine willingness (n = 363) was 81.3%. Univariate analysis identified that the odds of vaccine acceptance reduced for patients who do not regard COVID-19 as a severe illness, are of younger age, have a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, use illicit drugs, or carry Medicaid insurance. Multivariable logistic regression identified the best predictors of vaccine hesitancy to be: social media use to obtain COVID-19 information, concerns regarding vaccine safety, self-perception of a preexisting medical condition contraindicated with vaccination, not having received the annual influenza vaccine, having some high school education only, being a current smoker, and not having a prior cerebrovascular accident. Unique amongst males, a conservative political view strongly predicted vaccine hesitancy. Specifically for Asians, a higher body mass index, while for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), a positive depression screen, both reduced the odds of vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Upon identifying the variables associated with vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with neurological disorders, our clinic is now able to efficiently provide ancillary COVID-19 education to sub-populations at risk for vaccine hesitancy.

Depression is not only distressing and interfering in and of itself, but it is also consistently associated with non-adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Accordingly, research and clinical priorities require updated knowledge about interventions that address depression in PWH. RECENT FINDINGS: Twenty efficacy trials and nine pilot studies since a 2009 review emerged in the literature review search. Of these, 11 and 6 respectively had a depression-related inclusion criterion. The intervention strategies included individual psychotherapy (n=6), group therapy (n=6), telehealth (n=3), and antidepressant medication (n=5). Generally, these interventions demonstrated acute efficacy for improving depression symptoms in PWH, with some also addressing ART non-adherence. However, not all studies collected follow-up data. Furthermore, trials that addressed depression but did not specifically address non-adherence did not also show adherence improvements. SUMMARY: Existing interventions for depression have demonstrated efficacy in PWH, and these may have both positive mental and physical health outcomes.

We proposed, validated, and evaluated a risk management tool that stratifies LTHC patients by LACE predictive score for readmission risk, which can further help home care providers intervene with individualized preventive plans. Method: A before-and-after study was conducted by a LTHC unit in Taiwan. Patients with acute hospitalization within 30 days after discharge in the unit were enrolled as two cohorts (Pre-Implement cohort in 2017 and Post-Implement cohort in 2019). LACE score performance was evaluated by calibration and discrimination (AUC, area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve). The clinical utility was evaluated by negative predictive value (NPV). Results: There were 48 patients with 87 acute hospitalizations in Pre-Implement cohort, and 132 patients with 179 hospitalizations in Post-Implement cohort. These LTHC patients were of older age, mostly intubated, and had more comorbidities. There was a significant reduction in readmission rate by 44.7% (readmission rate 25.3% vs. 14.0% in both cohorts).

The prevalence, mechanism, and implications of gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated with COVID-19 among patients. The basic parameters such as GI symptoms, health care utilization, clinical predictor, and medication used were assessed with three Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (familial dysautonomia (FD), gastroparesis, and Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)). The nasopharyngeal swab was used for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The COVID-19 sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 98% respectively. STATA version 15.1 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the total SARS-CoV-2 tested patients in our hospital, 1540 FGIMD patients underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. COVID-19 RNA positive test rate was found 15.3% (235/1540) during the same period. Of all the tested patients, SARS-CoV-2 positive rate was higher (p<0.05) in COVID-19 patients with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) at 57.5% (885/1540) compared to 42.5% (655/1540) without risk factors. The COVID-19 prevalence in FGIMD patients was 3.3% (51/1540), 4.8% in IBS (56/1174), gastroparesis3.12% (24/770), and FD 2.4% (30/1250) in our hospital. Increased diarrhea, vomiting/nausea, weight loss, abdominal pain, and constipation were observed in FGIMD patients along with increases in H2 blocker, proton pump inhibitor and opioid use. The outpatient's visits, diagnostic tests such as lower and upper endoscopies and hospitalization were higher during COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pandemic prior period. Conclusion: The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was found higher in functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders patients during COVID-19 pandemic with increase healthcare utilization and medication usage.","output":"Prevalence, mechanism, and implications of gastrointestinal symptoms in covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>Physicians who are primary care providers in rural communities form an essential stakeholder group in rural mobile health (mHealth) delivery.

This study examines the factors that led to the receipt of user fee exemption cards, and the effect of card possession on the utilisation of healthcare services. Methods: A panel data set of 1652 randomly selected ultra-poor individuals was used. Logistic regression was applied on the end line data to identify factors associated with the receipt of user fee exemption cards. Random-effects modelling was applied to the panel data to determine the effect of the card possession on healthcare service utilisation among those who reported an illness six months before the surveys.

Objective: To evaluate whether unanticipated disparities by race or ethnicity arise from a single institution's resource allocation policy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included adults (aged &#8805;18 years) who were cared for on a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ward or in a monitored unit requiring invasive or noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula between May 26 and July 14, 2020, at 2 academic hospitals in Miami, Florida. Exposures: Race (ie, White, Black, Asian, multiracial) and ethnicity (ie, non-Hispanic, Hispanic). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was based on a resource allocation priority score (range, 1-8, with 1 indicating highest and 8 indicating lowest priority) that was assigned daily based on both estimated short-term (using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) and longer-term (using comorbidities) mortality. There were 2 coprimary outcomes: maximum and minimum score for each patient over all eligible patient-days. Standard summary statistics were used to describe the cohort, and multivariable Poisson regression was used to identify associations of race and ethnicity with each outcome. Results: The cohort consisted of 5613 patient-days of data from 1127 patients (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 62.7 [51.7-73.7]; 607 [53.9%] men). Of these, 711 (63.1%) were White patients, 323 (28.7%) were Black patients, 8 (0.7%) were Asian patients, and 31 (2.8%) were multiracial patients; 480 (42.6%) were non-Hispanic patients, and 611 (54.2%) were Hispanic patients. The median (IQR) maximum priority score for the cohort was 3 (1-4); the median (IQR) minimum score was 2 (1-3). After adjustment, there was no association of race with maximum priority score using White patients as the reference group (Black patients: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.12; Asian patients: IRR, 0.95; 95% CI. 0.62-1.45; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72-1.19) or of ethnicity using non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.10); similarly, no association was found with minimum score for race, again with White patients as the reference group (Black patients: IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.14; Asian patients: IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.62-1.49; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.07) or ethnicity, again with non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adult patients admitted to a COVID-19 unit at 2 US hospitals, there was no association of race or ethnicity with the priority score underpinning the resource allocation policy. Despite this finding, any policy to guide altered standards of care during a crisis should be monitored to ensure equitable distribution of resources.","output":"Assessment of Disparities Associated With a Crisis Standards of Care Resource Allocation Algorithm for Patients in 2 US Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide an overview of the epidemiology and clinical course of mucormycosis in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era.

So far, little attention has been paid to sex-specific variations of demographic, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 patients referred to the same hospital in the two consecutive pandemic waves. Methods: : Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected in 1,000 COVID-19 patients (367 females and 633 males), 500 hospitalized in the first wave and 500 in the second one, at the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia from March to December 2020. Statistical analyses have been employed to compare data obtained in females and males, taking into account their age, and during the first and second COVID-19 waves. Results: : The mean age at the time of hospitalization was similar in females and males but was significantly higher for both in the second wave;the time elapsed from symptoms onset to hospital admission did not differ between sexes in the two waves and no correlation was observed between delayed hospital admission and length of hospitalization. The number of multi-symptomatic males was higher than that of females and patients with a higher number of comorbidities were more frequently admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and more frequently died. Older males remained in ICU longer than females and showed a longer disease duration, mainly the first wave. The highest levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in males and in the first, and along with higher levels of D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin which were preferentially documented in patients requiring ICU or died. While the ICU death rate was higher in males, the overall death rate did not differ between the sexes;however, the deceased women were older. Conclusions: : These data indicate that once patients were hospitalized, the risk of dying was similar between females and males. Therefore, future studies should aim at understanding the reasons why, for a given number of SARS-CoV-2 infection, less females develop the disease requiring hospitalization.","output":"Sex differences in a cohort of COVID-19 Italian patients hospitalized during the first and second pandemic waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose an approach to tackle the problem of the automatic restoration of Arabic diacritics that includes three components stacked in a pipeline: a deep learning model which is a multi-layer recurrent neural network with LSTM and Dense layers, a character-level rule-based corrector which applies deterministic operations to prevent some errors, and a word-level statistical corrector which uses the context and the distance information to fix some diacritization issues.

METHODS: For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charit, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25C43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group.

In addition, the linkage between asthma and atopy during childhood has raised the question whether viral infections alone can precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure viral nucleic acid material has provided the opportunity to study virus-induced wheezing among children in greater detail, and investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have demonstrated how this virus can augment both the early and late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity.

Current multi-society guidelines do not advise any change to endoscope disinfection protocols but emphasize strict adherence to recommended practices. However, endoscopy reprocessing staff may benefit from supplemental personal protective equipment measures, especially in high risk situations. Because thorough endoscope reprocessing is highly operator dependent, adequate training of personnel is critical for proper manual cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes that have potential to harbor virus. Bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes has caused outbreaks of infection from multidrug resistant organisms, highlighting vulnerable areas. The emphasis of current studies is on optimization of disinfection and drying, minimization of simethicone use, and on quality control of endoscope reprocessing with sampling and microbiological culturing. Recent advances include novel approaches to endoscope sterilization, infection barrier methods, and design of partially or fully disposable duodenoscopes.

Factors threatening freshwater biodiversity are much wider and more complex, including climate change and severe weather events such as drought, unexpected floods, heavy storms, etc. Drought is an important factor contributing to this crisis. In this study, we evaluated changes in the immune function, antioxidant function, histopathology, and metabolites of crayfish in response to drought. The results indicate that drought suppresses immune function, the balance between oxidative and antioxidative systems, and induces tissue damage and metabolic disorder. Our work provides more information on how crayfish respond to drought. ABSTRACT: Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. The freshwater biodiversity crisis has caused widespread global concern. Drought as one of the factors causing freshwater biodiversity is still poorly understood. Crayfish is often used in academic research as a biological indicator. In this study, flow cytometry, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and untargeted metabolomics were used to analyze the immune function, histopathology, and metabolism of crayfish under drought conditions. After drought exposure, the total hemocytes count (THC) was significantly decreased (from 8.9  10(5) mL(?1) in the control group to 2.2  10(5) mL(?1) at day 5). Phagocytosis decreased by 66% after 5 days of drought. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hepatopancreas was upregulated. Moreover, histological disorder and metabolism changes in the hepatopancreas were obvious. These results indicate that drought suppresses immune function, disrupts the balance of oxidative and antioxidative systems, and induces tissue damage and metabolic changes in crayfish.","output":"Changes in the Immunity, Histopathology, and Metabolism of Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in Response to Drought"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reverse transcription loop\\\\mediated isothermal amplification (RT\\\\LAMP) was used to detect canine distemper virus (CDV) genomic RNA.

The dynamics of the general state (weakness, fatigue, concentration, dizziness, headache, sleep disorders) were evaluated on a visual-analog scale (VAS), the assessment of the subjective feeling of severity of asthenia (fatigue, physical and mental fatigue, decreased motivation and activity) - on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), cognitive functions - on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), vegetative tone - according to the Kerdo index. RESULTS At the end of the study (V3), statistically significant changes in indicators (VAS, MFI-20) were obtained only in the main group patients; no statistically significant differences were obtained for the Kerdo index. Analysis of the MMSE data revealed a decrease in cognitive functions in both groups, which may be associated with pseudocognitive deficits due to asthenia.

The layered material TaIrTe4 is a newly predicted time-reversal invariant type II Weyl semimetal with the minimum number of Weyl points. Here, we report the discovery of surface superconductivity in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. Our scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) visualizes Fermi arc surface states of TaIrTe4 that are consistent with the previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. By a systematic study based on STS at ultralow temperature, we observe uniform superconducting gaps on the sample surface. The superconductivity is further confirmed by electrical transport measurements at ultralow temperature, with an onset transition temperature (T c) up to 1.54 K being observed. The normalized upper critical field h*(T/T c) behavior and the stability of the superconductivity against the ferromagnet indicate that the discovered superconductivity is unconventional with the p-wave pairing. The systematic STS, and thickness- and angular-dependent transport measurements reveal that the detected superconductivity is quasi-1D and occurs in the surface states.

Conventional antibodies prefer binding to the convex portion of the antigen, whereas VHHs prefer epitopes, such as crevices and clefts on the antigen. Therefore, developing candidates with the binding characteristics of camelid VHHs is important. Thus, To this end, a synthetic VHH library that reproduces the structural properties of camelid VHHs was constructed. First, the characteristics of VHHs were classified according to the paratope formation based on crystal structure analyses of the complex structures of VHHs and antigens. Then, we classified 330 complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) structures of VHHs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into three loop structures: Upright, Half-Roll, and Roll. Moreover, these structures depended on the number of amino acid residues within CDR3. Furthermore, in the Upright loops, several amino acid residues in the FR2 are involved in the paratope formation, along with CDR3, suggesting that the FR2 design in the synthetic library is important. A humanized synthetic VHH library, comprising two sub-libraries, Upright and Roll, was constructed and named PharmaLogical. A validation study confirmed that our PharmaLogical library reproduces VHHs with the characteristics of the paratope formation of the camelid VHHs, and shows good performance in VHH screening.","output":"Construction of a Humanized Artificial VHH Library Reproducing Structural Features of Camelid VHHs for Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on delivery of social support services. This might be expected to particularly affect older adults and people living with dementia (PLWD), and to reduce their well-being. AIMS: To explore how social support service use by older adults, carers and PLWD, and their mental well-being changed over the first 3 months since the pandemic outbreak. METHODS: Unpaid dementia carers, PLWD and older adults took part in a longitudinal online or telephone survey collected between April and May 2020, and at two subsequent timepoints 6 and 12 weeks after baseline. Participants were asked about their social support service usage in a typical week prior to the pandemic (at baseline), and in the past week at each of the three timepoints. They also completed measures of levels of depression, anxiety and mental well-being. RESULTS: 377 participants had complete data at all three timepoints. Social support service usage dropped shortly after lockdown measures were imposed at timepoint 1 (T1), to then increase again by T3. The access to paid care was least affected by COVID-19. Cases of anxiety dropped significantly across the study period, while cases of depression rose. Well-being increased significantly for older adults and PLWD from T1 to T3. CONCLUSIONS: Access to social support services has been significantly affected by the pandemic, which is starting to recover slowly. With mental well-being differently affected across groups, support needs to be put in place to maintain better well-being across those vulnerable groups during the ongoing pandemic.","output":"COVID-19-related social support service closures and mental well-being in older adults and those affected by dementia: a UK longitudinal survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present work, 4-[(5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)(phenyl)methyl]-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (BPZ) was synthesized by one pot multicomponent reaction of ethylacetoacetate, phenylhydrazine and benzaldehyde in the presence of Ce-MCM-48 catalyst.

The purpose of this study was intended to compared in-hospital mortality, major complications, and aortic remodeling between TAR and/or stent graft implantation in a medical center of northern Taiwan. METHODS Between January 2008 and August 2017, 156 patients with acute type I aortic dissection underwent surgery at our institution, including proximal aortic replacement only (Group I, n = 72), concomitant TAR (Group II, n = 23), concomitant TAR extended with stent grafting (Group III, n = 45), and proximal aortic replacement with descending aortic stent grafting (Group IV, n = 16). RESULTS No significant differences were found in underlying disease and preoperative presentations, including operative risk among four groups. Overall in-hospital mortality was 22.4% (13 patients in Group I, 9 in Group II, 12 in Group III, and 1 in Group IV). New-onset stroke occurred in 15 patients postoperatively (3 patients [5.2%] in Group I, 3 [21.4%] in Group II, and 9 [26.5%] in Group III after excluding 36 patients with documented preoperative cerebrovascular accident or cerebral malperfusion). Root reconstruction and TAR were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. TAR was significantly associated with surgery-related stroke. Compared to those in Group I, true lumen expansion and false lumen shrinkage during 1-year aortic remodeling were significantly higher in Groups III and IV. Both TAR and descending aorta stent grafting were significantly associated with decreased risk of patent false lumen. CONCLUSIONS Proximal aortic replacement remains the preferred surgical strategy for acute type I aortic dissection, with lower mortality and neurological complications.

This initial down-regulation followed by the induction of innate immune response to IBV infection appears to be inadequate for the control of IBV genome accumulation and consequent histopathological changes in these tissues. Potential induction of innate immunity before infection occurs may be necessary to reduce the consequences since vaccine induced immunity is slow to develop.","output":"Induction of innate immune response following infectious bronchitis corona virus infection in the respiratory tract of chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The aim of this study was to determine outcome of ischemic stroke patients in the anterior circulation treated with endovascular treatment (EVT) with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) versus EVT alone group. Methods A systemic literature review was performed using online database from January 2004 to January 2017. Primary outcomes were successful recanalization seen on finial angiography and good outcome at three months. Secondary outcomes were mortality and the development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (S-ICH) after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used when heterogeneity was less than 50%. Egger's regression test was used to assess publication bias. Results Five studies were included for final analysis. Between EVT with IVT and EVT alone group, successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.467, p=0.216), good clinical outcome at three months (OR 1.199, p=0.385), mortality (OR 0.776, p=0.371), and S-ICH (OR 1.820, p=0.280) did not differ significantly. Egger's regression intercept with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.99 (95% CI -2.91 to 6.89) in successful recanalization and -0.27 (95% CI -6.35 to 5.80) in good clinical outcome, respectively. Conclusion The two treatment modalities, EVT with IVT and EVT alone, could be comparable in treating acute anterior circulation stroke.

Though guidelines are available to optimize syncope care, research indicates that current clinical guidelines have not significantly impacted resource utilization surrounding emergency department (ED) evaluation of syncope. Matching implementation strategies to barriers and facilitators and tailoring strategies to local context hold significant promise for a successful implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Our team applied implementation science principles to develop a stakeholder-based implementation strategy. Methods and Materials: We partnered with patients, family caregivers, frontline clinicians and staff, and health system administrators at four health systems to conduct quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews for context assessment. The identification of implementation strategies was done by applying the CFIR-ERIC Implementation Strategy Matching Tool and soliciting stakeholders inputs. We then co-designed with patients and frontline teams, and developed and tested specific strategies. Results: A total of 114 clinicians completed surveys and 32 clinicians and stakeholders participated in interviews. Results from the surveys and interviews indicated low awareness of syncope guidelines, communication challenges with patients, lack of CPG protocol integration into ED workflows, and organizational process to change as major barriers to CPG implementation. Thirty-one patients and their family caregivers participated in interviews and expressed their expectations: clarity regarding their diagnosis, context surrounding care plan and diagnostic testing, and a desire to feel cared about. Identifying change methods to address the clinician barriers and patients and family caregivers expectations informed development of the multilevel, multicomponent implementation strategy, MISSION, which includes patient educational materials, mentored implementation, academic detailing, Syncope Optimal Care Pathway and a corresponding mobile app, and Lean quality improvement methods. The pilot of MISSION demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and initial success on appropriate testing.

The Government of Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) were no exception, with most members from the regular force (Reg F), the primary reserve force (P Res), and the DND public service (DND PS) working from home. The COVID-19 Defence Team Survey was administered from April 29th, 2020, and May 22nd, 2020, to gain insight into work, health, and family-related challenges since the onset of the pandemic and change in work arrangements. Responses from five open-ended questions were qualitatively analyzed to determine general themes of concern regarding work, personal, and family related challenges, stress-management and coping strategies, and recommendations for improving the work situation and personal well-being. Given the different roles and conditions of employment, responses of the different groups or components of respondents (Reg F, P Res, DND PS) were compared to identify common and unique challenges to inform targeted organizational responses. A total of 26,207 members (Reg F = 13,668, 52.2%; P Res = 5,052, 19.3%; DND PS = 7,487, 28.6%) responded to the survey's five open-ended questions, which yielded a total of 75,000 open-ended responses. When asked about work-related challenges, respondents' most common challenges included dissatisfaction with technology/software, work arrangements, ergonomics, work-life balance, communication within the organization, and the uncertainties regarding career development. In terms of personal and/or family-related challenges, the most common challenges included social isolation, the impact of the pandemic on mental health, school closures and homeschooling, caring for vulnerable family members, and childcare concerns. The most common stress-management and coping strategies included exercise, spending time outdoors, communicating or spending time with family members, household chores/projects, mind-body wellness exercises, and playing games. The most common recommendations made by respondents to improve their work- or personal-related situations included improving technological capabilities, streamlining communication, providing hardware and software necessary to ensure comfortable ergonomics, the provision of flexibility in terms of telework schedules, return-to-work decisions, and the expansion of benefits and access to childcare services. In terms of differences among the components, DND PS personnel were most likely to report dissatisfaction with technological changes and ergonomics, and to recommend improving these technological limitations to maximize productivity. Reg F members, on the other hand, were most likely to recommend increased support and access to childcare, and both Reg F and P Res members were more likely to mention that increased benefits and entitlements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be ameliorative. The results of this study highlight several important facts about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personnel working in large, diverse organizations. For example, advancements in organizational technological capabilities were highlighted herein, and these are likely to grow to maintain productivity should remote work come to be used more extensively in the long-term.

However, the clinical significance remains poorly defined. We investigated whether patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia not responding to antibiotics and in whom high levels of HSV could be detected in respiratory secretions benefit from acyclovir treatment. METHODS: Respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirates) were tested for HSV replication by quantitative real-time PCR. ICU survival times, clinical parameters, and radiographic findings were retrospectively compared between untreated and acyclovir treated patients with high (> 10(5) HSV copies/mL) and low (10(3)C10(5) HSV copies/mL) viral load. RESULTS: Fifty-seven low and 69 high viral load patients were identified. Fewer patients with high viral load responded to antibiotic treatment (12% compared to 40% of low load patients, p = 0.001). Acyclovir improved median ICU survival (8 vs 22 days, p = 0.014) and was associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for ICU death (HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.11C0.92, p = 0.035) in high load patients only. Moreover, circulatory and pulmonary oxygenation function of high load patients improved significantly over the course of acyclovir treatment: mean norepinephrine doses decreased from 0.05 to 0.02 g/kg body weight/min between days 0 and 6 of treatment (p = 0.049), and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased from 187 to 241 between day 3 and day 7 of treatment (p = 0.02). Chest radiographic findings also improved significantly (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, antibiotic treatment failure, and high levels of HSV replication, acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly longer time to death in the ICU and improved circulatory and pulmonary function.

We aimed to evaluate the performance and degree of correlation of three fully automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with neutralization activity using a surrogate virus-neutralizing test (sVNT) from GenScript, targeting the receptor-binding domain. Methods: 110 sera collected from PCR-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals were tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) using the sVNT. Positive samples were tested on three automated immunoassays targeting different viral antigens: Mindray CL-900i?, Abbott Architect, and Ortho VITROS?. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, agreement, and correlation with the sVNT were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal thresholds for predicting the presence of neutralizing activity by each assay. Results: All three assays showed 100% specificities. The highest sensitivity was 99.0%, demonstrated by VITROS?, followed by 94.3%, for CL-900i?, and 81.0%, for Architect. Both VITROS? and CL-900i? had the strongest correlation with the sVNT ( = 0.718 and  = 0.712, respectively), while Architect showed a moderate correlation ( = 0.618).

This effect becomes more challenging for the manufacturers of high-demand and most essential items, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. In a pandemic situation, the demand of the essential products increases expressively; on the other hand, the supply of the raw materials decreases considerably with a constraint of production capacity. These dual disruptions impact the production process suddenly, and the process can collapse without immediate and necessary actions. To minimize the impacts of these dual disruptions, we aim to develop a recovery model for making a decision on the revised production plan. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors use a mathematical modeling approach to develop a production recovery model for a high-demand and essential item during the COVID-19. The authors also analyze the properties of the recovery plan, and optimize the recovery plan to maximize the profit in the recovery window. Findings: The authors analyze the results using a numerical example.

Since then, it has caused more than 1.5 million deaths and has affected more than 68 million people worldwide (1). Methemoglobinemia is a very rare and potentially life-threatening condition. Congenital methemoglobinemia is caused by a deficiency in cytochrome b5 reductase (Cyb5R) while acquired is caused by exposure to an oxidizing agent such as chloroquine or dapsone. We present a case of a critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed methemoglobinemia without an identifiable cause. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old gentleman with past medical history of hypertension presents to the emergency department (ED) with chief complaints of shortness of breath and myalgias for the past 3 days. In the ED, patient was found to tachycardic at 121 beats/minute, tachypneic at 40 breaths/minute, and febrile at 38.6 Celsius. He was found to have elevated COVID-19 labs which included C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, creatine phosphokinase, d-dimer in addition to elevated BUN 53 mg/dL and creatinine 2.92 mg/dL. His COVID-19 PCR resulted positive and was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) for his respiratory distress and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further monitoring. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime along with dexamethasone and remdesivir. Within 24 hours of admission, patient required mechanical ventilation for worsening hypoxemia. Furthermore, his kidney function continued to decline and required continuous renal replacement therapy. His oxygen requirements improved until hospital day 10;where he developed methemoglobinemia measuring 11.8%. Patient was then given methylene blue 1mg/kg and 1.5 grams of ascorbic acid. Hematology was consulted for emergent exchange transfusion as he developed hemolysis but was deemed too unstable and unlikely to benefit. Patient subsequently went into multisystem organ failure and died on hospital day 12. DISCUSSION: To date, there has only been one reported case of COVID-19 complicated by methemoglobinemia without an identifiable cause (2). Our patient tested negative for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a full medication reconciliation was performed without an identifiable cause. However, there have been 10 cases reported that were either associated with use of an oxidizing agent such as hydroxychloroquine or G6PD deficiency (3C6). Therefore, clinicians should be cognizant of the rising cases of methemoglobinemia and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation with refractory hypoxemia, clinicians should be mindful that methemoglobinemia may be a contributing factor. Therefore, in the setting of refractory hypoxemia in COVID-19, measuring methemoglobin levels should be considered. REFERENCE #1: 1) Home - Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.

This could have resulted in later consultation and more severe presentations. We describe three medical cases that had recently been affected by COVID-19 and developed a rare and rapidly evolving diabetic foot that required a major amputation. One possible explanation for this atypical presentation could be that COVID-19 predisposes patients to vein and arterial thrombosis due to systemic inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction and stasis from prolonged immobility. This could have exacerbated chronic ischemia secondary to diabetes in which metabolic disturbances often seen in these patients predispose to atherosclerosis.","output":"Atypical presentation of diabetic toot in post-COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Late complications and longer-lasting sequelae of COVID-19 infection in adults can occur. Cardiovascular involvement including reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery aneurysms, and pericardial involvement have been reported. Prompt recognition is the first step and secondly, these cardiovascular phenomena require an alternative set of therapeutics from the standard of care for acute COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe two cases that fulfill the current case definition of the recently defined multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). One patient is a 27-year-old white female and the other a 21-year-old French creole male, both without any prior medical history. Both were hospitalized and found to have significant cardiac dysfunction and treated with IVIG, high dose aspirin, and corticosteroids with resolution of their acute illnesses and cardiac sequelae. CONCLUSION: Not only does the immediate impact of this viral infection need to be addressed, but also the long-term complications that could arise if not recognized and treated promptly as seen in our two cases. Patients can develop acute cardiovascular collapse and cardiogenic shock which requires high level of care and treatment within an intensive care unit. Depending on the complications, patients may require treatment for congestive heart failure, pericarditis, or even coronary artery disease acutely with close follow up to ensure improvement or resolution.","output":"Two cases of multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in adults in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we have used an agent-based stochastic tumor growth model and presented a mathematical and theoretical perspective to cancer therapy.

Two fundamental parameters, the basic reproduction number (R (0)) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID\\\\19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R (0) and CFR of COVID\\\\19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review to find the reported estimates of the R (0) and the CFR in articles from international databases between January 1 and August 31, 2020. Random\\\\effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of R (0) and the CFR. Furthermore, R (0) and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where the studies were conducted. To assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected articles, the I (2) statistic and the Cochran's Q test were used. RESULTS: Forty\\\\five studies involving R (0) and 34 studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of R (0) was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.49 (2.08, 2.94) in Asia to 3.40 (2.81, 4.04) in North America. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs 2.27). However, R (0) did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. CONCLUSIONS: An R (0) of 2.69 and a CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID\\\\19. Although R (0) and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.","output":"Estimation of novel coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) reproduction number and case fatality rate: A systematic review and meta\\\\analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein-protein ligand is one of the most detection methods used in Nano biosensors.

Lateral flow tests for antigen and antibody detection are an obvious candidate for use in community-wide testing, because they are quick and cheap relative to lab-processed tests. However, their low accuracy has limited their adoption. We develop a new methodology to increase the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of cheap, quick and inaccurate index tests with correlated or discordant outcomes, and illustrate its performance on commercially available lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) for Sars-CoV-2 antibody detection. Methods and Findings: We analyze laboratory test outcomes of 300 serum samples from health care workers detected with PCR-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection at least 21 days prior to sample collection, and 500 pre-pandemic serum samples, from a national seroprevalence survey, tested using eight LFIAs (Abbott, Biosure/Mologic, Orientgene-Menarini, Fortress, Biopanda I, Biopanda II, SureScreen and Wondfo) and Hybrid DABA as reference test. For each of 14 two-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress) and 16 three-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress, Biosure/Mologic) used on at least 100 positive and 100 negative samples, we classify an outcome sequence -- e.g., (+,-) for (Abbott, Fortress) -- as positive if its combination positive predictive value (CPPV) exceeds a given threshold, set between 0 and 1. Our main outcome measures are the sensitivity and specificity of different classification rules for classifying the outcomes of a combination test. We define testing possibility frontiers which represent sensitivity and false positive rates for different thresholds. The envelope of frontiers further enables test selection. The eight index tests individually meet neither the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity criterion, nor the US Center for Disease Control's 99.5% specificity criterion. Among these eight tests, the highest single-test LFIA specificity is 99.4% (with a sensitivity of 65.2%) and the highest single-test LFIA sensitivity is 93.4% (with a specificity of 97.4%). Using our methodology, a two-test combination meets the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's criterion, achieving sensitivity of 98.4% and specificity of 98.0%. While two-test combinations meeting the US Center for Disease Control's 99.5% specificity criterion have sensitivity below 83.6%, a three-test combination delivers a specificity of 99.6% and a sensitivity of 95.8%. Conclusions: Current CDC guidelines suggest combining tests, noting that 'performance of orthogonal testing algorithms has not been systematically evaluated' and highlighting discordant outcomes. Our methodology combines available LFIAs to meet desired accuracy criteria, by identifying testing possibility frontiers which encompass benchmarks, enabling cost savings. Our methodology applies equally to antigen testing and can greatly expand testing capacity through combining less accurate tests, especially for use cases needing quick, accurate tests, e.g., entry to public spaces such as airports, nursing homes or hospitals.","output":"A new combination testing methodology to identify accurate and economical point-of-care testing strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microglia and macrophages are related cell types that play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE.

The pandemic threatens blood supply but we do not yet know its impact on blood donations or on the perceptions and expectations of donors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in four hospital-based blood services in Cameroon, using a survey design and focusing on the subjective and cultural aspects of donors. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, we collected the participants' responses as to their understanding of COVID-19 and of current protection measures, and their expectations. Data on trends of blood donations were collected retrospectively for the period from 1st January to 30th April 2019 and the same period in 2020. RESULTS: Of 494 donors included, 432 (874%) were enrolled from fixed blood collection sites and 62 (126%) were contacted by phone. A total of 464 (939%) participants believed that the COVID-19 is a lung disease, but some declared it to be imaginary (77%), a foreign disease (83%) or a blood-borne disease (32%). The participants reported that the distribution of face masks and hydroalcoholic solutions (925%), social distancing and hygiene (63%) are the most important measures that need to be in place for safe donation. The number of blood donations dropped by 215% between 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSION: Most of the donors know COVID-19, its transmission routes and manifestations. In the absence of barrier measures, they perceive blood donation as a threat to their health.

STUDY DESIGN: Families were randomized to intervention (n = 61) or standard care (n = 59). The intervention was delivered at home by psychologists and physiotherapists over the infants' first year, focusing on infant development and parental mental health. At 13-years' corrected age, cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes, and parental mental health were assessed. Primary estimands were between-group mean differences (MDs), estimated using multiple imputed regression models. RESULTS: Follow-up included 81 (69%) surviving children. There was little evidence for intervention benefits for IQ, attention, and executive function, working memory, and academic skills, regardless of level of social risk. Specifically, MDs in adolescent cognitive outcomes ranged from -2.0 units (95% CI -9.9, 5.9) in favor of standard treatment to 5.1 (-2.3, 12.5) units favoring the intervention. A group-by-social risk interaction was observed only for adolescent motor outcomes, with MDs favoring the intervention for those at higher social risk (balance: 4.9 [95% CI 1.3, 8.5]; total motor: 3.2 [95% CI 0.3, 6.2]), but not those at lower social risk (balance: -0.3 [95% CI -2.4, 1.9], total motor: 0.03 [95% CI -1.9, 2.0]).

However, category distribution in the five profiles was significantly different among the age groups. Furthermore, analysis using the BCH command showed significant differences in mental health among these profiles. Lastly, interactive analyses indicated resilience had a positive relationship with mental health, and social support served as a buffer against the negative impact of low resilience on mental health.

The virus has already killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. OBJECT: The principal intent of this work was to investigate lead compounds by screening natural product library (NPASS) for possible treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Pharmacophore features were used to screen a large database to get a small dataset for structure-based virtual screening of natural product compounds. In the structure-based screening, molecular docking was performed to find a potent inhibitor molecule against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6Y7M). The predicted lead compound was further subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to check the stability of the leads compound with the evolution of time. RESULTS: In pharmacophore-based virtual screening, 2,361 compounds were retained out of 30,927. In the structure-based screening, the lead compounds were filtered based on their docking scores. Among the 2,360 compounds, 12 lead compounds were selected based on their docking score. Kazinol T with NPASS ID: NPC474104 showed the highest docking score of -14.355 and passed criteria of Lipinski's drug-like parameters. Monitoring ADMET properties, Kazinol T showed its safety for consumption. Docking of Kazinol T with two Asian mutants (R60C and I152V) showed variations in binding and energy parameters. Normal mode analysis for ligand-bound and unbound form of protease along with its mutants, revealed displacement and correlation parameters for C-alpha atoms. MD simulation results showed that all ligand-protein complexes remained intact and stable in a dynamic environment with negative Gibbs free energy.

In highlighting this history, I argue that self-organised labour platform workers were critical to the passage of a state law (AB5) that would have forced companies to treat them as employees?with access to predictable living wages, unemployment insurance, workers? compensation, and health insurance, among other safety net protections. Finally, I show how, leveraging tremendous structural and instrumental power, the major labour platform companies, in the middle of the global Coronavirus pandemic, sponsored a successful referendum on AB5, and lay out the anti-democratic implications of the referendum's passage.","output":"Economic security & the regulation of gig work in California: From AB5 to Proposition 22"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn December 2020, Israel began a mass vaccination program with the rapid rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine for adults in Israel. The campaign vaccinated fewer people than necessary for herd immunity. However, at the same time, government stringency measures in terms of closing public life were decreased. Real-world observational data were used to examine the effect of mass vaccination on Covid-19 mortality. MethodsThe study period to examine the effect of vaccination on mortality was chosen to capture when at least 90% of the population over age 70 were vaccinated for less than seven months. Projected deaths as expected from vaccine efficacy and actual mortality data were compared for the study population with examination of potential confounding effects of government stringency. Average government stringency (Oxford Stringency Index) was calculated in the study period and the preceding period of the pandemic. Potential confounding effects of an age shift in the distribution of deaths were examined by analyzing the distributions of deaths and cases before and after the study period. ResultsConfirmed deaths from COVID-19 in the population over 70 after mass vaccination were recorded as 370, versus 408 expected from applying person-days of vaccine efficacy, and 5,120 estimated without vaccinations. ConclusionsVaccines against COVID-19 saved more lives than expected by simply applying individual vaccine efficacy to the vaccinated population in Israel, despite a loosening of government stringency.","output":"How many lives do COVID vaccines save?

The objective of the study was to identify and classify the neuropsychological symptoms of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in one of the most important front-line tertiary hospitals from Spain, and to analyze its correlation with diagnosed mental disorders, as well as to explore potential risk factors associated with mental health problems. This observational, cohort study involved data from COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) from February to May 2020. First, patients underwent a semistructured phone interview (screening phase), based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Then the confirmation of the diagnosis (confirmation phase) was performed in patients who reported a mental disorder development or worsening. A factorial analysis was performed to identify groups of symptoms. A tetrachoric matrix was created, and factorial analysis, by a principal component analysis, was employed upon it. Factors showing values >1.0 were selected, and a varimax rotation was applied to these factors. Symptoms most frequently identified in patients were anosmia/ageusia (54.6%), cognitive complaints (50.3%), worry/nervousness (43.8%), slowing down (36.2%), and sadness (35.4%). Four factors were identified after the screening phase. The first (anxiety/depression) and second (executive dysfunction) factors explained 45.4 and 11.5% of the variance, respectively. Women, age between 50 and 60 years, duration in the hospital (more than 13 days), and psychiatric history showed significant higher levels (number of symptoms) in the factors. This study reports the factor structure of the psychiatric symptoms developed by patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 during the first wave of the COVID-19. Three item domains (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms) were loaded together on one factor, whereas sleep disturbance stood up as a separate factor. Interestingly, the item anosmia/ageusia was not captured by any factor. In conclusion, an increase in neuropsychiatric morbidity is expected in the upcoming months and years. Therefore, screening for early symptoms is the first step to prevent mental health problems associated with this pandemic.","output":"Neuropsychological Symptom Identification and Classification in the Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients During the First Wave of the Pandemic in a Front-Line Spanish Tertiary Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are currently no licensed drugs against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), but vaccines are available.

Our experiments show that EGCG can effectively inhibit PEDV infections (with HLJBY and CV777 strains) at different time points in the infection using western blot analysis. We found that EGCG inhibited PEDV infection in a dose-dependent manner 24 h after the infection commenced using western blotting, plaque formation assays, immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). We discovered that EGCG treatment of Vero cells decreased PEDV attachment and entry into them by the same method analysis. Western blotting also showed that PEDV replication was inhibited by EGCG treatment. Whereas EGCG treatment was found to inhibit PEDV assembly, it had no effect on PEDV release.

Eukaryotic cells are equipped with highly conserved stress-response mechanisms that support cellular function when homeostasis is compromised, promoting survival. Two such mechanisms C the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy C are involved in the cellular response to perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum, in calcium homeostasis, in cellular energy or redox status. Each of them operates through conserved signaling pathways to promote cellular adaptations that include re-programming transcription of genes and translation of new proteins and degradation of cellular components. In addition to their specific functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways intersect in many ways in different contexts of cellular stress. Viral infections are a major cause of cellular stress as many cellular functions are coopted to support viral replication. Both UPR and autophagy are induced upon infection with many different viruses with varying outcomes C in some instances controlling infection while in others supporting viral replication and infection. The role of UPR and autophagy in response to coronavirus infection has been a matter of debate in the last decade. It has been suggested that CoV exploit components of autophagy machinery and UPR to generate double-membrane vesicles where it establishes its replicative niche and to control the balance between cell death and survival during infection. Even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated, it is clear that UPR and autophagy are intimately associated during CoV infections. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought renewed interest to this topic as several drugs known to modulate autophagy C including chloroquine, niclosamide, valinomycin, and spermine C were proposed as therapeutic options.

One of the core proteins that regulates inter-cellular adhesion, E-cadherin plays important roles in tumorigenesis as well as in tumor progression; however, the exact expression changes and modulation that occur in gastric cancer are not yet fully understood. In an attempt to estimate if the synthesis/degradation balance matches the final membrane expression of this adhesion molecule in cancer tissue, we assessed the proportion of E-cadherin that is found in the Golgi vesicles as well as in the lysosomal pathway We utilized archived tissue fragments from 18 patients with well and poorly differentiated intestinal types of gastric cancer and 5 samples of normal gastric mucosa, by using high-magnification multispectral microscopy and high-resolution fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. Our data showed that E-cadherin is not only expressed in the membrane, but also in the cytoplasm of normal and tumor gastric epithelia. E-cadherin colocalization with the Golgian vesicles seemed to be increasing with less differentiated tumors, while co-localization with the lysosomal system decreased in tumor tissue; however, the membrane expression of the adhesion molecule clearly dropped from well to poorly differentiated tumors. Thus E-cadherin seems to be more abundantly synthetized than eliminated via lysosomes/exosomes in less differentiated tumors, suggesting that post-translational modifications, such as cleavage, conformational inactivation, or exocytosis, are responsible for the net drop of E-cadherin at the level of the membrane in more anaplastic tumors. This behavior is in perfect accordance with the concept of partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (P-EMT), when the E-cadherin expression of tumor cells is in fact not downregulated but redistributed away from the membrane in recycling vesicles. Moreover, our high-resolution deconvolution microscopy study showed for the first time, at the tissue level, the presence of Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1)-positive exosomes/multivesicular bodies being trafficked across the membranes of tumor epithelial cells. Altogether, a myriad of putative modulatory pathways is available as a treatment turning point, even if we are to only consider the metabolism of membrane E-cadherin regulation. Future super-resolution microscopy studies are needed to clarify the extent of lysosome/exosome exchange between tumor cells and with the surrounding stroma, in histopathology samples or even in vivo.","output":"E-Cadherin Modulation and Inter-Cellular Trafficking in Tubular Gastric Adenocarcinoma: A High-Resolution Microscopy Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide evidence on the consumer staples industry's commitment and accountability to employees prior to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic by analysing their employee\\\\related disclosures in annual reports.

METHODS: In 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death. Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients had an overall mortality of 37 %. Most patients were male (78 %) with a mean age of 54 years. Almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers (23.5 %) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with MERS-CoV. Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Survival was reduced in the presence of coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypoxemia, CXR (chest X-ray) abnormalities, leukocytosis, creatinine >1  5 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. In a multivariate analysis of treatments administered, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with MERS-CoV remains a challenge. In this retrospective cohort, interferon beta and mycophenolate mofetil treatment were predictors of increased survival in the univariate analysis.

Policies and guidance for containing the infection and reducing the COVID-19 related deaths have proven to be effective, however the extent to which health inequity factors were considered in these policies is rather unknown. The aim of this study is to measure the extent to which COVID-19 related policies reflect equity considerations by focusing on the global policy landscape around wearing masks and personal protection equipment (PPE). METHODS: A systematic search for published documents on COVID-19 and masks/PPE was conducted across six databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, ASSIA and Psycinfo. Reviews, policy documents, briefs related to COVID-19 and masks/PPE were included in the review. To assess the extent of incorporation of equity in the policy documents, a guidance framework known as PROGRESS-Plus: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, disability etc.) was utilized. RESULTS: This review included 212 policy documents. Out of 212 policy documents, 190 policy documents (89.62%) included at least one PROGRESS-plus component. Most of the policy documents (n = 163, 85.79%) focused on occupation component of the PROGRESS-plus followed by personal characteristics associated with discrimination (n = 4;2.11%), place of residence (n = 2;1.05%) and education (n = 1;0.53%). Subgroup analysis revealed that most of the policy documents (n = 176, 83.01%) were focused on workers such as healthcare workers, mortuary workers, school workers, transportation workers, essential workers etc. Of the remaining policy documents, most were targeted towards whole population (n = 30; 14.15%). Contrary to worker focused policy documents, most of the whole population focused policy documents didnt have a PROGRESS-plus equity component rendering them equity limiting for the society. CONCLUSION: Our review highlights even if policies considered health inequity during the design/implementation, this consideration was often one dimensional in nature. In addition, population wide policies should be carefully designed and implemented after identifying relevant equity related barriers in order to produce better outcomes for the whole society.

METHOD: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was carried out with 10 Reiki practitioners. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: adapting and growing with the challenges of COVID-19, Reiki for individual and community resilience, and moving from the mainstream hands on to lesser known distant Reiki. CONCLUSION: While the COVID-19 pandemic personally impacted Reiki practitioners, they focused on turning adversity into opportunity, to overcome a sense of disconnectedness and social isolation, by providing social support and promoting individual and community resilience. Practitioners focused on self-care, personal development and reaching out to the community.

Equally important is the consideration of how breast cancer services can be safely re-introduced, as infection rates from COVID-19 decline.

This study examined healthworker preparedness for COVID-19 management and implementation experiences in Ugandas refugee-hosting districts. METHODS: A cross sectional, mixed-method descriptive study in 17 health facilities in 7 districts from 4 major regions. Total sample size was 485 including > 370 health care workers (HCWs). HCW knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. The quantitative data was processed and analysed using SPSS 26, and statistical significance assumed at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. Bloom's cutoff of 80% was used to determine threshold for sufficient knowledge level and practices with scores classified as high (80.0C100.0%), average (60.0C79.0%) and low ( 59.0%). HCW implementation experiences and key stakeholder opinions were further explored qualitatively using interviews which were audio-recorded, coded and thematically analysed. RESULTS: On average 71% of HCWs were knowledgeable on the various aspects of COVID-19, although there is a wide variation in knowledge. Awareness of symptoms ranked highest among 95% (p value < 0.0001) of HCWs while awareness of the criteria for intubation for COVID-19 patients ranked lowest with only 35% (p value < 0.0001). Variations were noted on falsehoods about COVID-19 causes, prevention and treatment across Central (p value < 0.0356) and West Nile (p value < 0.0161) regions. Protective practices include adequate ventilation, virtual meetings and HCW training. Deficient practices were around psychosocial and lifestyle support, remote working and contingency plans for HCW safety. The work environment has immensely changed with increased demands on the amount of work, skills and variation in nature of work. HCWs reported moderate control over their work environment but with a high level of support from supervisors (88%) and colleagues (93%). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs preparedness is inadequate in some aspects. Implementation of healthcare interventions is constrained by the complexity of Ugandas health system design, top-down approach of the national response to COVID-19 and longstanding health system bottlenecks.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is the first time that a pathogen's spread across the globe has been extensively monitored by direct detection of the pathogen itself rather just than the morbidity left in its wake, indicates such heterogeneity is not limited to outcomes of infections but whether infection of a particular host occurs at all. This suggests an important role for yet to be discovered environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors that influence whether an exposure to the virus initiates a productive infection and, moreover, the severity of disease that results. This article discusses the emerging hypothesis that the composition of a host's commensal microbial communities, that is, its 'microbiome', may be one such determinant that influences outcomes following encounters with respiratory viral pathogens in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.

Coercive measures are often necessary to treat critically ill patients in the ICU. It is nevertheless important to keep these measures to a minimum in order to respect the dignity of patients and the cohesion of the clinical team. A deeper understanding of what patients and their relatives perceive during their ICU stay will shed different light on intensive care management. Patients' experiences of loss of control, dependency and abandonment may lead to a new approach towards a broader approach to the concept of coercion in intensive care. The aim of our research is to explore the experiences of patients and relatives in the ICU and to determine when it might be possible to reduce feelings and memories of coercion. METHODS We conducted and analysed 29 semi-structured interviews with patients and relatives who had been in the ICU a few months previously. Following a coding and categorisation process in MAXQDA?, a rigorous qualitative methodology was used to identify themes relevant to our research. RESULTS Five main themes emerged: memory issues; interviewees' experiences of restricting measures and coercive treatment; patients' negative perception of situational and relational dependency with the risk of informal coercion; patients' perceptions of good care in a context of perceived dependency; progression from perception of coercion and dependency to respect for the person. All patients were grateful to have survived. However, coercion in the form of restraint, restriction of movement, and coercive treatment in the ICU was also acknowledged by patients and relatives. These included elements of informal coercion beyond restraints, such as a perceived negative sense of dependence, surrender, and asymmetrical interaction between the patient and health providers. CONCLUSIONS To capture the full range of patients' experiences of coercion, it is necessary to expand the concept of coercion to include less obvious forms of informal coercion that may occur in dependency situations. This will help identify solutions to avoid or reduce negative recollections that may persist long after discharge and negatively affect the patients' quality of life.","output":"What does coercion in intensive care mean for patients and their relatives?

In the process of making informed, cost-effective, and timely decisions, maintenance engineers must rely on human-created, heterogeneous, structured, and also largely unstructured information. The maturing research on vision-based power line inspection driven by advancements in deep learning offers first possibilities to move towards more holistic, automated, and safe decision-making. However, (current) research focuses solely on the extraction of information rather than its implementation in decision-making processes. The paper addresses this shortcoming by designing, instantiating, and evaluating a holistic deep-learning-enabled image-based decision support system artifact for power line maintenance at a German distribution system operator in southern Germany. Following the design science research paradigm, two main components of the artifact are designed: A deep-learning-based model component responsible for automatic fault detection of power line parts as well as a user-oriented interface responsible for presenting the captured information in a way that enables more informed decisions. As a basis for both components, preliminary design requirements are derived from literature and the application field. Drawing on justificatory knowledge from deep learning as well as decision support systems, tentative design principles are derived. Based on these design principles, a prototype of the artifact is implemented that allows for rigorous evaluation of the design knowledge in multiple evaluation episodes, covering different angles. Through a technical experiment the technical novelty of the artifacts capability to capture selected faults (regarding insulators and safety pins) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured image data (model component) is validated. Subsequent interviews, surveys, and workshops in a natural environment confirm the usefulness of the model as well as the user interface component. The evaluation provides evidence that (1) the image processing approach manages to address the gap of power line component inspection and (2) that the proposed holistic design knowledge for image-based decision support systems enables more informed decision-making. The paper therefore contributes to research and practice in three ways. First, the technical feasibility to detect certain maintenance-intensive parts of power lines with the help of unique UAV image data is shown. Second, the distribution system operators specific problem is solved by supporting decisions in maintenance with the proposed image-based decision support system. Third, precise design knowledge for image-based decision support systems is formulated that can inform future system designs of a similar nature.

This coincided with a rapid rise in paediatric COVID-19-associated hospitalisations. Methods We synthesized data from five sources to describe the impact of Omicron on clinical manifestations and outcomes of hospitalized children ([]19 years) with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in Tshwane District from 31 October to 11 December 2021, including: 1) COVID-19 line lists; 2) collated SARS-CoV-2 testing data; 3) SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data; 4) COVID-19 hospitalisation surveillance; and 5) clinical data of public sector paediatric ([]13 years) COVID-19 hospitalisations. Findings During the six-week period 6,287 paediatric ([]19 years) COVID-19 cases were recorded in Tshwane District, of these 462 (7.2%) were hospitalized in 42 hospitals (18% of overall admissions). The number of paediatric cases was higher than in the prior 3 waves, uncharacteristically preceding adult hospitalisations. Of the 75 viral specimens sequenced from the district, 99% were Omicron. Detailed clinical information obtained from 139 of 183 (76%) admitted children ([]13 years; including all public sector hospitalisations) indicated that young children (0-4 years) were most affected (62%). Symptoms included fever (47%), cough (40%), vomiting (24%), difficulty breathing (23%), diarrhoea (20%) and convulsions (20%). Length of hospital stay was short (mean 3.2 days), and in 44% COVID-19 was the primary diagnosis. Most children received standard ward care (92%), with 31 (25%) receiving oxygen therapy. Seven children (6%) were ventilated; four children died, all related to complex underlying co-pathologies. All children and majority of parents for whom data were available were unvaccinated.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation technology acceptance in terms of (1) the timing and approaches used and (2) patients perspectives on its usability, utility, acceptability, acceptance, and external variables. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus (inception to July 2021) for English-language papers that reported empirical evidence on the technology acceptance of early-phase home-based cardiac telerehabilitation in patients with coronary heart disease. Content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: The search identified 1798 studies, of which 18 studies, with 14 unique home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs, met eligibility criteria. Technology acceptance (of the home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs) was mostly evaluated at intra- and posttrial stages using questionnaires (n=10) and usage data (n=11).

The A.30 variant, reported in Tanzania and other countries, harbors spike gene mutations that help this strain to bind more robustly and to escape neutralizing antibodies. The present study uses molecular modelling and simulation-based approaches to investigate the key features of this strain that result in greater infectivity. The protein-protein docking results for the spike protein demonstrated that additional interactions, particularly two salt-bridges formed by the mutated residue Lys484, increase binding affinity, while the loss of key residues at the N terminal domain (NTD) result in a change to binding conformation with monoclonal antibodies, thus escaping their neutralizing effects. Moreover, we deeply studied the atomic features of these binding complexes through molecular simulation, which revealed differential dynamics when compared to wild type. Analysis of the binding free energy using MM/GBSA revealed that the total binding free energy (TBE) for the wild type receptor-binding domain (RBD) complex was ?58.25 kcal/mol in contrast to the A.30 RBD complex, which reported ?65.59 kcal/mol. The higher TBE for the A.30 RBD complex signifies a more robust interaction between A.30 variant RBD with ACE2 than the wild type, allowing the variant to bind and spread more promptly. The BFE for the wild type NTD complex was calculated to be ?65.76 kcal/mol, while the A.30 NTD complex was estimated to be ?49.35 kcal/mol. This shows the impact of the reported substitutions and deletions in the NTD of A.30 variant, which consequently reduce the binding of mAb, allowing it to evade the immune response of the host. The reported results will aid the development of cross-protective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","output":"Investigation of the binding and dynamic features of A.30 variant revealed higher binding of RBD for hACE2 and escapes the neutralizing antibody: A molecular simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the advent of Rituximab and subsequently the emergence of other compounds targeting B cells, a cornucopia of medical applications have been found for this family of compounds.

To fill this gap, this study investigated the psychological state of disordered gamblers' AFMs during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy, the European country first affected by the virus and with the largest gambling market. We were interested in understanding if the unavailability of most land-based gambling offerings during the lockdown created a sense of relief in AFMs. We also compared the quality of family relationships and emotional state during the lockdown of AFMs with those of their relative with Gambling Disorder (GD). Participants were 53 disordered gamblers' AFMs (77% female; mean age = 50.28). For 42 out of the 53 AFMs, we also recruited their relative with GD (86% male; mean age = 48.98). A semi-structured telephone interview was developed. Although AFMs reported a general interruption of the relative's gambling behaviour and a general sense of relief for the closure of gambling activities, accompanied by the perception of good family relationships, AFMs still felt tired, worried, and apprehensive and perceived more fear, stress, and anxiety than before the lockdown. A large proportion of AFMs engaged in potentially addictive behaviours, especially TV and mobile phone and Internet use, which increased in frequency compared to before the pandemic. They still perceived some gambling-related problematic behaviours from their relative and put in place coping strategies to manage the gambling problem. Even if they had a general positive orientation towards the future, they experienced fear when thinking about the reopening of gambling opportunities at the end of the lockdown. Compared to their relatives with GD, AFMs appeared more prone to perceiving a general negative state and a worsening of it from before the lockdown. Overall, this study shows that disordered gambling's AFMs can be considered as a particularly at-risk group who deserves focused clinical attention even during gambling closures related to pandemic lockdown.","output":"What About Affected Family Members of Disordered Gamblers During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

The automated emotion recognition has applications in multiple domains such as health care, e-learning, surveillance, etc. The development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools has led to the automated recognition of human emotions. OBJECTIVE This review paper provides an insight into various methods employed using electroencephalogram (EEG), facial, and speech signals coupled with multi-modal emotion recognition techniques. In this work, we have reviewed most of the state-of-the-art papers published on this topic. METHOD This study was carried out by considering the various emotion recognition (ER) models proposed between 2016 and 2021. The papers were analysed based on methods employed, classifier used and performance obtained. RESULTS There is a significant rise in the application of deep learning techniques for ER. They have been widely applied for EEG, speech, facial expression, and multimodal features to develop an accurate ER model. CONCLUSION Our study reveals that most of the proposed machine and deep learning-based systems have yielded good performances for automated ER in a controlled environment.

METHODS: In this population-based retrospective study, we included all the hospitalized positive patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan City from December 29, 2019 to April 15, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from administrative datasets coordinated by the Wuhan Health Commission. The propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to adjust the confounding factors. RESULTS: There are 36,358 patients in the final cohort, in which 1,160 (3.2%) had a prior stroke. After adjusting for available baseline characteristics, patients with prior stroke had a higher proportion of severe and critical illness and mortality. We found for the first time that the premorbid modified Rankin Scale (MRS) grouping (odds ratio [OR] = 1.796 [95% CI 1.334C2.435], p < 0.001) and older age (OR = 1.905 [95% CI 1.211C3.046], p = 0.006) imparted increased risk of death. AIS following COVID-19 occurred in 124 (0.34%) cases, and patients with prior stroke had a much higher incidence of AIS (3.4%). Logistic regression analyses confirmed an association between the severity of COVID-19 with the incidence of AIS. COVID-19 patients with AIS had a significantly higher mortality compared with COVID-19 patients without stroke and AIS patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients with prior stroke, especially those with the higher premorbid MRS or aged, have worse clinical outcomes.

Methods: The experimental study method was adopted. DPCs from the vibrissa of male C57BL/6J mice aged 5 to 6 weeks and keratinocytes (KCs) from the skin of newborn C57BL/6J mice were obtained by enzyme-digestion method. Stable expression of DPCs markers such as nerve cell adhesion molecules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), -catenin, and -smooth muscle actin were identified by immunofluorescence method in the third passage of the former cells, while the latter primary cells stably expressed keratin 15, a marker of KCs. The 8th passage of DPCs were resuspended with GelMA and inoculated on the bottom surface of the Transwell plate insert, and then the GelMA drops were photocrosslinked and cultured upside down later. The DPCs aggregation in the GelMA drops after culture of 0 (immediately) and 3 day (s) was observed under an optical microscope (the DPCs aggregates were the biomimetic DPSs). Cell viability in biomimetic DPSs cultured for 3 days was detected by live/dead staining kit. The primary DPCs and the 8th passage of DPCs with traditionally two-dimensional culture, and the biomimetic DPSs prepared by the above-mentioned method were set as primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing was performed of 3 samples in each group after three days of culture using the high-throughput sequencing technology platform. The principal component analysis, Pearson similarity analysis, and differentially expressed genes screening were performed using OmicShare Tools based on the transcriptome data. Cluster analysis of expression patterns of differentially expressed genes was performed using time series trend analysis software. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes with specific expression patterns were performed using the OmicShare Tools. The cells were grouped as before, and the sex determining region Y-Box 8 (SOX8), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), collagen type  alpha 1 chain (COL26A1), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 6 (Wnt6) were screened out from the differentially expressed genes according to the random number table, which were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to verify the consistency between mRNA expression of differentially expressed genes and sequencing results (n=9); the mRNA expressions of DPCs biological function markers fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), Wnt10a, lymphoid enhancement factor 1 (LEF1), ALP, -catenin, versican, and SOX2 were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR (n=9). Three male BALB/c nude mice aged 5-6 weeks were divided into primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group. The primary DPCs, the 8th passage of DPCs, and the biomimetic DPSs were mixed with primary KCs at a ratio of 21 in cell number and then injected subcutaneously into corresponding groups, with 6 injection regions for each mouse. Two weeks after the injection, the full-thickness skin of the injection region was taken, the regenerated hair was counted, and regenerated hair follicle was observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, Tukey test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: After 3 days of culture, DPCs aggregated into biomimetic DPSs in GelMA hanging drops from the dispersed state on culture day 0, and the cells in the biomimetic DPSs had good cell activity. After 3 days of culture, principal component analysis showed that compared with that of 8th passage of DPCs group, the variation degree among samples within primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was relatively close, and the variation degree was the lowest between samples of biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group; the variation degree of gene profile data of more than 90% of DPCs samples in 3 groups could be explained by the first and second principal components. Pearson similarity analysis showed that samples within each group had good repeatability. The similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was 0.84-0.95, and the similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and 8th passage of DPCs group was 0.72-0.87. The differentially expressed genes among the three groups were analyzed and 642 differentially expressed genes with group intersection were screened out. Clusters of expression patterns showed that two gene expression patterns showed a significant trend (P<0.05), the first pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly lower than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, and the second pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly higher than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, including a total of 411 differentially expressed genes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 411 differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in Wnt signaling pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway (P<0.05), while GO enrichment analysis showed that GO terms such as extracellular matrix, classical Wnt signaling pathway, and cell differentiation were significantly enriched (P<0.05). The mRNA expressions of SOX8, MMP-9, COL26A1 and Wnt6 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group (q=15.950, 8.854, 11.890, 11.050, 9.851, 5.884, 7.418, 4.870, P<0.01), consistent with the sequencing data. Compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group, the mRNA expressions of FGF7, Wnt10a, LEF1, ALP, -catenin, versican, and SOX2 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased (q=11.470, 9.795, 4.165, 9.242, 10.970, 10.570, 8.005, 7.472, 4.976, 3.651, 4.784, 5.236, 6.825, 5.214, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Two weeks after injection, nude mice in 8th passage of DPCs group failed to regenerate hair, while the numbers of hair regenerated in biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group were close (q=1.852, P>0.05) and both were significantly higher than the number of 8th passage of DPCs group (q=18.980, 17.130, P<0.01). In 8th passage of DPCs group, only necrotic foci were found in the injection region of the skin of nude mice, while regenerated hair follicles were observed in the injection region of both biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group, and melanosis was observed in the cross section of hair follicles. Conclusions: Based on GelMA biomimetic microenvironment and hanging drop method, the biomimetic DPSs culturing model prepared by three dimensional culture of DPCs can restore the hair follicle inducing ability of high passage of DPCs to a certain extent, and its biological characteristics are more similar to those of the primary DPCs, which can restore the characteristics of DPCs.","output":"[Biological activity and hair inducing function of biomimetic dermal papilla spheres prepared by hanging drops of methacrylate gelatin]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The COVID-19 pandemic as a serious public health concern has been accompanied with changes and restrictions in everyday life. This can affect directly or indirectly health behaviors and disease management, particularly in developing countries with low resources.

Methods This was a prospective cohort study involving 300 patients with type 2 diabetes who had been referred to a referral tertiary care diabetes clinic during 2018C2019. The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Assessment (SDSCA) questionnaire was used for the evaluation of 5 self-care activities. Results The mean total self-care score before and one year after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis was 37.63 (SD, 10.89) and 26.14 (SD, 10.99), respectively. Before the COVID-19 crisis, 27%, 54.3%, and 18.7% of patients had poor, moderate, and good self-care, respectively.

DesignSetting and Participants: In this cohort study of 903 healthcare workers who completed surveys about baseline characteristics and COVID-19 vaccine/infection history, 647 had antibody assays completed and were included herein. ExposureCOVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 (n=387); BNT162b2 (n=212); or Ad26.COV2.S (n=10); unvaccinated (n=10); or boosted (n=28). Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was IgG anti-spike titer. Secondary/tertiary outcomes included IgG spike receptor-binding domain competitive antibody blocking ELISA pseudoneutralization against the USA-WA1/2020 strain, and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection. Antibody levels were compared using ANOVA and multiple linear regression. ResultsMean age was 49.7, 75.3% were female, and mean comorbidities/patient was 0.7. Baseline variables were balanced (p>.05) except for immunosuppression (higher in boosted, p=.047), prior COVID-19 infections (higher with Ad26.COV2.S and unvaccinated, p<.001), and time since primary vaccination (higher with mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S, p<.001).

The preservation of food is essential for human survival, and different techniques were initially used to limit the growth of spoiling microbes, e.g., drying, heating, salting, or fermentation. Water activity, temperature, redox potential, preservatives, and competitive microorganisms are the most important approaches used in the preservation of food products. Preservative agents are generally classified into antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-browning agents. On the other hand, artificial preservatives (sorbate, sulfite, or nitrite) may cause serious health hazards such as hypersensitivity, asthma, neurological damage, hyperactivity, and cancer. Thus, consumers prefer natural food preservatives to synthetic ones, as they are considered safer. Polyphenols have potential uses as biopreservatives in the food industry, because their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities can increase the storage life of food products. The antioxidant capacity of polyphenols is mainly due to the inhibition of free radical formation. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of plants and herbs is mainly attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds. Thus, incorporation of botanical extracts rich in polyphenols in perishable foods can be considered since no pure polyphenolic compounds are authorized as food preservatives. However, individual polyphenols can be screened in this regard. In conclusion, this review highlights the use of phenolic compounds or botanical extracts rich in polyphenols as preservative agents with special reference to meat and dairy products.","output":"Natural Polyphenols for the Preservation of Meat and Dairy Products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION Ordinal classification problems arise in a variety of real-world applications, in which samples need to be classified into categories with a natural ordering. An example of classifying high-dimensional ordinal data is to use gene expressions to predict the ordinal drug response, which has been increasingly studied in pharmacogenetics. Classical ordinal classification methods are typically not able to tackle high-dimensional data and standard high-dimensional classification methods discard the ordering information among the classes. Existing work of high-dimensional ordinal classification approaches usually assume a linear ordinality among the classes. We argue that manually-labeled ordinal classes may not be linearly arranged in the data space, especially in high-dimensional complex problems. RESULTS We propose a new approach that can project high-dimensional data into a lower discriminating subspace, where the innate ordinal structure of the classes is uncovered. The proposed method weights the features based on their rank correlations with the class labels and incorporates the weights into the framework of linear discriminant analysis. We apply the method to predict the response to two types of drugs for patients with Multiple Myeloma, respectively. A comparative analysis with both ordinal and nominal existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a competitive predictive performance while honoring the intrinsic ordinal structure of the classes. We provide interpretations on the genes that are selected by the proposed approach to understand their drug-specific response mechanisms.

The author suggests that the discourse of lifelong learning constructs a relation of what Lauren Berlant terms cruel optimism for the marginalised majority of South Africans, sustaining a fantasy of liberatory education despite empirical evidence to the contrary. First, the prevalence of this discourse in key policy texts (predominantly education policy white papers) is examined, along with how both instrumentalist and humanist framings of lifelong learning promote and sustain this relation in spite of the ordinariness of the attrition of the subject (in Berlants terms) as a defining experience of everyday life. Next, the ubiquitous frame of crisis in education analysis in South Africa is considered, along with techno-solutionism (a term coined by Evgeny Morozov in 2013) as a popular response amongst the dominant middle-class minority. The article suggests that cruel optimism is sustained for this middle-class group through techno-solutionist education utopias, as what Berlant terms a redefinitional strategy for manufacturing ahistorical moments of agency in the face of persistent structural issues centuries in the making. The lens of cruel optimism is thus offered as a mechanism for denaturalising the political work of both discourses, a necessary (albeit insufficient) move towards better grasping the nature of South African education concerns, as well as theories of change that might offer genuinely emancipatory learning for all.","output":"Lifelong learning as cruel optimism: Considering the discourses of lifelong learning and techno-solutionism in South African education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present discrete-event simulation models of the operations of primary health centres (PHCs) in the Indian context. Our PHC simulation models incorporate four types of patients seeking medical care: outpatients, inpatients, childbirth cases, and patients seeking antenatal care. A generic modelling approach was adopted to develop simulation models of PHC operations. This involved developing an archetype PHC simulation, which was then adapted to represent two other PHC configurations, differing in numbers of resources and types of services provided, encountered during PHC visits. A model representing a benchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational guidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times closer to international estimates (higher than observed), was also developed. Simulation outcomes for the three observed configurations indicate negligible patient waiting times and low resource utilisation values at observed patient demand estimates. However, simulation outcomes for the benchmark configuration indicated significantly higher resource utilisation. Simulation experiments to evaluate the effect of potential changes in operational patterns on reducing the utilisation of stressed resources for the benchmark case were performed. Our analysis also motivated the development of simple analytical approximations of the average utilisation of a server in a queueing system with characteristics similar to the PHC doctor/patient system.

The device was well-tolerated in all cases with no adverse events. Higher serum C reactive protein and more extensive (3 lobes) involvement at chest X-ray upon admission were observed in the h-CPAP group. Assessment of temporal distribution of cases showed a substantially increased rate of CPAP requirement during the third pandemic wave (January-March 2021). In conclusion, h-CPAP was feasible, safe, well-tolerated and improved oxygenation in pregnant women with moderate-to-severe ARF due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

To that end, primary prevention is far better than managing subsequent organ damage. When medication is needed to prevent or manage disease, the preferred choice should be associated with the greatest benefits and fewest adverse effects. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women worldwide. Considering disease-adjusted life years, other leading causes are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, dementias, hearing loss, cancers of the breast, lung and bowel, osteoporosis, fractures and falls, depression, osteoarthritis, refractive errors of the eye and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. This review explores the global prevalence of these diseases in women aged 50 years and older, and medications commonly used for them, and contrasts the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) with others. When initiated early, there is good evidence for MHT benefit in all-cause mortality and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis; fair evidence for benefit in dementias, depression and osteoarthritis; limited evidence for benefit in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hearing loss, non-diabetic chronic kidney disease and colorectal cancer; null effects on lung cancer and refractive errors; and varied effects on breast cancer and stroke.

Design Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. Setting Wuxi, Eastern China. Participants Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Main outcomes measures Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. Results The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. Conclusions The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person.

Multilevel analyses show that both positive and negative emotions are contagious, but the two paths diverge markedly in how the diffusion stops. Positive contact between C and B (which leads to improved mood for B) spreads to A through Bs contact with A, making A feel better afterward, regardless of whether Bs mood deteriorated between the two interactions. Negative contact between C and B (which leads to worsened mood for B) also spreads to A, making A feel worse after the contact with B. However, the spread of a negative mood discontinues if Bs mood improved between the two contacts.

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the risk factors of PONV in patients undergoing ambulatory strabismus surgery under general anaesthesia, with the treatments of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination. Methods: We reviewed 721 consecutive patients (12-60 years old) undergoing ambulatory strabismus surgery under general anaesthesia at an academic eye centre between December 2016 and January 2019. Patients received prophylactic treatment of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination during anaesthesia induction, and PONV was evaluated during the early recovery period before discharge. Results: The dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination effectively reduced the incidence of PONV (3.05%, 22/721), and the patients who experienced PONV had statistically prolonged phase II recovery time as compared those who did not (P = 0.006). The sum of the extraocular muscles manipulated and the use of nalbuphine (vs flurbiprofen axetil) were the independent risk factors for PONV (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The sum of the extraocular muscles manipulated and the use of nalbuphine are potentially modifiable risk factors for PONV after strabismus surgery with the treatments of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination.","output":"Retrospective analysis of risk factors of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing ambulatory strabismus surgery via general anaesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effectively modeling text-rich fresh content such as news articles at document-level is a challenging problem.

The model is validated by in situ temperature measurements on a porcine spinal cord model. The maximum error for tissue temperature of this model is 12.6%, and the overall average error is 4.2%. The lesional region (>50C) is identified to be as wide as 5 mm, and thermal dose cumulative equivalent minutes at 43C (CEM 43) is also calculated with this model. The incorporation of nonisothermal flow has been shown to be crucial in order to accurately predict thermal dose in tissue.

In particular, our group previously reported that 1 over 4 COVID-19 healed men were found to be crypto- / azoo-spermic. Moreover, most patients had elevated IL-8 semen levels at sperm analysis. The aim of our study was to assess semen parameters and inflammation by evaluating a panel of sperm cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, INF gamma, TNF-alpha) on average 1 month after the second SARS-CoV-2 negative nasopharyngeal swab and 3 months later. Methods: : Ten men who showed normozoospermia (n=3), oligozoospermia (n=3) or crypto/azoospermia (n=4) 1 month after healing from COVID-19 in our previous study, were re-called and re-evaluated 3 months after the first semen analysis. Semen parameters were evaluated according to WHO manual and seminal plasma cytokine levels by an ELISA method. Results: : At 3-months follow-up, 8 men showed an overall increase of semen parameters compared to levels assessed after 1 month. In particular, of the 4 crypto-/azoo-spermic men 1 month after healing, 2 resulted oligozoospermic, 1 normozoospermic and only 1 remained azoospermic. Two of the 3 oligozoospermic men turned normozoozpermic. Semen cytokine levels were remarkably high one month after healing and remained elevated after 3 months, with the exception of IL-6. Conclusions: : This is the first longitudinal, prospective study comparing semen parameters and semen inflammatory markers one and three months after recovering from COVID-19. Our data indicate an overall tendency to an improvement of semen parameters although a genital tract inflammatory condition appears to persist at least 3 months after COVID-19 recovery.

Thus, women and men were exposed to very different roles and associated challenges, which may have affected their well-being very differently. Using data from the National Educational Panel Study and its supplementary COVID-19 web survey for Germany (May?June 2020), we investigate gender differences in the relationship between working conditions and within-changes in subjective well-being. We systematically consider the household context by distinguishing between adults with and without younger children in the household. The results from multivariate change-score regressions reveal a decline in all respondents' life satisfaction, particularly among women with and without younger children. However, the greater reduction in women's well-being cannot be linked to systematic differences in working conditions throughout the pandemic. Kitagawa?Oaxaca?Blinder counterfactual decompositions confirm this conclusion. Further analyses suggest that women's caregiving role, societal concerns, and greater loneliness partly explain the remaining gender differences in altered satisfaction. From a general perspective, our results suggest important gender differences in social life and psychological distress at the beginning of the pandemic, which are likely to become more pronounced as the crisis has unfolded.","output":"Reduced well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic C The role of working conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying the secondary structure of an RNA is crucial for understanding its diverse regulatory functions.

Our purpose was to conceptualise 'mutual safety', which could increase benefit as well as reduce harm. METHODS A cultural-historical analysis of how medical education has positioned the patient as an object of benefit guided implementation research into how mutual safety could be achieved. RESULTS Educating doctors to abide by moral principles and use rigorous habits of mind and scientific technologies made medicine a profession. Doctors' complex attributes addressed patients' complex diseases and personal circumstances, from which doctors benefited too. The patient safety movement drove reforms, which reorientated medical education from complexity to simplicity: clinicians' competencies should be standardised and measurable, and clinicians whose 'incompetence' caused harm remediated. Applying simple standards to an increasingly complex, and therefore inescapably risky, practice could, however, explain clinicians' declining psychosocial health. We conducted a formative intervention to examine how 'acting wisely' could help clinicians benefit patients amidst complexity. We chose the everyday task of insulin therapy, where benefit and harm are precariously balanced. 247 students, doctors, and pharmacists used a thought tool to plan how best to perform this risky task, given their current clinical capabilities, and in the sometimes-hostile clinical milieus where they practised. Analysis of 1000 commitments to behaviour change and 600 learning points showed that addressing complexity called for a skills-set that defied standardisation. Clinicians gained confidence, intrinsic motivation, satisfaction, capability, and a sense of legitimacy from finding new ways of benefiting patients. CONCLUSION Medical education needs urgently to acknowledge the complexity of practice and synergise doctors' and patients' safety.

METHOD: Study 1 included the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and McDonalds  in a general population sample (N = 471). Study 2 foresaw the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and convergent validity in 169 participants with obesity. Study 3 tested the capability of the EBA-O to characterize eating behaviors in a clinical sample of 74 patients with obesity. RESULTS: Study 1. EFA identified five factors (i.e., food addiction, night eating, binge eating, sweet eating, and prandial hyperphagia), explaining 68.3% of the variance. The final EBA-O consisted of 18 items. McDonalds  ranged between 0.80 (hyperphagia) and 0.92 (binge eating), indicating very good reliability. Study 2.

PATIENTS Critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (n = 330) admitted between September 2012 and October 2015 were compared to consecutive critically ill patients with community-acquired severe acute respiratory infection of non-Middle East respiratory syndrome etiology (non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection) (n = 222). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Although Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection patients were younger than those with non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (median [quartile 1, quartile 3] 58 yr [44, 69] vs 70 [52, 78]; p < 0.001), clinical presentations and comorbidities overlapped substantially. Patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had more severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2: 106 [66, 160] vs 176 [104, 252]; p < 0.001) and more frequent nonrespiratory organ failure (nonrespiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: 6 [4, 9] vs 5 [3, 7]; p = 0.002), thus required more frequently invasive mechanical ventilation (85.2% vs 73.0%; p < 0.001), oxygen rescue therapies (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 5.8% vs 0.9%; p = 0.003), vasopressor support (79.4% vs 55.0%; p < 0.001), and renal replacement therapy (48.8% vs 22.1%; p < 0.001).

Reimbursement is one key factor regarding the availability of hyperthermia for deep-seated tumors, with high variability in reimbursement between countries. We report the current reimbursement status and related pattern of care for the use of deep hyperthermia in Switzerland over a time period of 4.5 years. This analysis will provide the basis for the national standardization of deep hyperthermia treatment schedules and quality assurance guidelines, as well as for the expansion of deep hyperthermia indications in the future. This comprehensive insight into deep hyperthermia reimbursement and practice in Switzerland might also be of interest for other national hyperthermia societies. ABSTRACT: Background: Moderate hyperthermia is a potent and evidence-based radiosensitizer. Several indications are reimbursed for the combination of deep hyperthermia with radiotherapy (dHT+RT). We evaluated the current practice of dHT+RT in Switzerland. Methods: All indications presented to the national hyperthermia tumor board for dHT between January 2017 and June 2021 were evaluated and treatment schedules were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 183 patients presented at the hyperthermia tumor board, 71.6% were accepted and 54.1% (99/183) finally received dHT. The most commonly reimbursed dHT indications were local recurrence and compression (20%), rectal (14.7%) and bladder (13.7%) cancer, respectively. For 25.3% of patients, an individual request for insurance cover was necessary. 47.4% of patients were treated with curative intent; 36.8% were in-house patients and 63.2% were referred from other hospitals. Conclusions: Approximately two thirds of patients were referred for dHT+RT from external hospitals, indicating a general demand for dHT in Switzerland. The patterns of care were diverse with respect to treatment indication. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows for the first time the pattern of care in a national cohort treated with dHT+RT. This insight will serve as the basis for a national strategy to evaluate and expand the evidence for dHT.","output":"Present Practice of Radiative Deep Hyperthermia in Combination with Radiotherapy in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has threatened patients, healthcare systems, and all countries across the globe with unprecedented challenges and uncertainties.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the assessment of risk and model the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Variables associated with hospital mortality using bivariate analysis were included as potential independent predictors associated with mortality at the p <0.05levels. Results: We included 114 studies accounting for 310,494 patients from various parts of the world. For the purpose of this analysis, we set a cutoff point of 10% for the mortality percentages. High mortality rates were defined as higher than 10% of confirmed positive cases and were given a score of two, while low mortality percentage (<10%) was assigned to the score of one. We then analyzed the associations between 72 variables and the observed mortality rates. These variables included a large range of related conditions such as demographics, signs and symptoms and related morbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, imaging studies, underlying diseases, and the status of countries' income based on United Nation's classifications. Conclusion: Findings suggest that older age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus conferred a significant increased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. In the multivariate analysis, only diabetes mellitus demonstrated an independent relationship with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to ascertain the relationship between possible risk factors with COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 - a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early reports indicate that the social determinants of health are implicated in COVID-19 incidence and outcomes.

This study aimed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility. Moreover, the treatment and clinical outcome were described. All neurosurgical adults admitted to one of the largest neurosurgical centers in China with clinically significant CoNS isolated from cerebrospinal fluid cultures in 2012 to 2020 were recruited. One episode was defined as one patient with one bacterial strain. Interpretive categories were applied according to the MICs. The clinical outcomes were dichotomized into poor (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1 to 3) and acceptable (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 to 5). In total, 534 episodes involving 519 patients and 16 bacteria were analyzed. Over the 9 years, eight antimicrobial agents were used in antimicrobial susceptibility tests, including six in over 80% of CoNS. The range of resistance rates was 0.8% to 84.6%. The vancomycin resistance rate was the lowest, whereas the penicillin resistance rate was the highest. The linezolid (a vancomycin replacement) resistance rate was 3.1%. The rate of oxacillin resistance, representing methicillin-resistant staphylococci, was 70.2%. There were no significant trends of antimicrobial susceptibility over the 9 years for any agents analyzed. However, there were some apparent changes. Notably, vancomycin-resistant CoNS appeared in recent years, while linezolid-resistant CoNS appeared early and disappeared in recent years. Vancomycin (or norvancomycin), the most common treatment agent, was used in 528 (98.9%) episodes. Finally, 527 (98.7%) episodes had acceptable outcomes. It will be safe to use vancomycin to treat CoNS-related HCAVM in the immediate future, although continuous monitoring will be needed. IMPORTANCE Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the main pathogens in health care-associated ventriculitis and meningitis. There are three conclusions from the results of this study. First, according to antimicrobial susceptibility, the rates of resistance to primary antimicrobial agents are high and those to high-level agents, including vancomycin, are low. Second, the trends of resistance rates are acceptable, especially for high-level agents, although long-term and continuous monitoring is necessary. Finally, the clinical outcomes of neurosurgical adults with coagulase-negative staphylococci-related health care-associated ventriculitis and meningitis are acceptable after treatment with vancomycin. Therefore, according to the antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical practice, vancomycin will be safe to treat coagulase-negative staphylococci-related health care-associated ventriculitis and meningitis.","output":"Trends of Antimicrobial Susceptibility in Clinically Significant Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci Isolated from Cerebrospinal Fluid Cultures in Neurosurgical Adults: a Nine-Year Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following reports on research undertaken concerning the misinformation problem on social media during the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections in 2020. Employing techniques borrowed from data journalism, it develops a form of cross-platform analysis that is attuned to both commensurability as well as platform specificity. It analyses the most engaged-with or top-ranked political content on seven online platforms: TikTok, 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google Web Search. Discussing the extent to which social media platforms marginalize mainstream media and mainstream the fringe, the analyses found that TikTok parodies mainstream media, 4chan and Reddit dismiss it and direct users to alternative influencer networks and extreme YouTube content. Twitter prefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebooks fake news problem also concerns declining amounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram has influencers (rather than, say, experts) dominating user engagement. By comparison, Google Web Search buoys the liberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but generally gives special interest sources, as they were termed in the study, the privilege to provide information rather than official sources. The piece concludes with a discussion of source and platform criticism, concerning how online platforms are seeking to filter the content that is posted or found there through increasing editorial intervention.

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative EAS, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 214 CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibodies (IgG) using two commercial immunoassays: EUROIMMUN (ELISA) and Abbott (Chemiluminescence). Quantification of nAbs was performed using the Cytopathic Effect\\\\based Virus Neutralization test. Three criteria for identifying donors with nAbs  1:160 were tested: C C1: Curve ROC; ? C2: Conditional decision tree considering only the IA results and C C3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables. RESULTS: The performance of the immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers 1:160.

However, the improvement in overall survival is modest and only in combination with chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify potential underlying mechanisms of resistance specific to antiangiogenic therapy and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we found that anti-VEGFR2 therapy up-regulates both C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in orthotopic murine CRC models, including SL4 and CT26. Blockade of CXCR4 signaling significantly enhanced treatment efficacy of anti-VEGFR2 treatment in both CRC models. CXCR4 was predominantly expressed in immunosuppressive innate immune cells, which are recruited to CRCs upon anti-VEGFR2 treatment. Blockade of CXCR4 abrogated the recruitment of these innate immune cells. Importantly, these myeloid cells were mostly Ly6Clow monocytes and not Ly6Chigh monocytes. To selectively deplete individual innate immune cell populations, we targeted key pathways in Ly6Clow monocytes (Cx3cr1-/- mice), Ly6Chigh monocytes (CCR2-/- mice), and neutrophils (anti-Ly6G antibody) in combination with CXCR4 blockade in SL4 CRCs. Depletion of Ly6Clow monocytes or neutrophils improved anti-VEGFR2-induced SL4 tumor growth delay similar to the CXCR4 blockade. In CT26 CRCs, highly resistant to anti-VEGFR2 therapy, CXCR4 blockade enhanced anti-VEGFR2-induced tumor growth delay but specific depletion of Ly6G+ neutrophils did not. The discovery of CXCR4-dependent recruitment of Ly6Clow monocytes in tumors unveiled a heretofore unknown mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF therapies.

However, when these vaccine candidates were evaluated in phase I clinical trials, there were inconsistencies between the observations in animal models and in humans. The vaccine viruses did not replicate well and immune responses were variable in humans, even though the study subjects were seronegative with respect to the vaccine viruses before vaccination. Therefore, we sought a model that would better reflect the findings in humans and evaluated African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate model. The distribution of sialic acid (SA) receptors in the respiratory tract of AGMs was similar to that in humans. We evaluated the replication of wt and ca viruses of avian influenza (AI) virus subtypes H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 in the respiratory tract of AGMs. All of the wt viruses replicated efficiently, while replication of the ca vaccine viruses was restricted to the upper respiratory tract. Interestingly, the patterns and sites of virus replication differed among the different subtypes. We also evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 ca vaccines. Protection from wt virus challenge correlated well with the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.

We conclude that live attenuated pandemic influenza virus vaccines replicate similarly in AGMs and human subjects and that AGMs may be a useful model to evaluate the replication of ca vaccine candidates. Importance: Ferrets and mice are commonly used for preclinical evaluation of influenza vaccines. However, we observed significant inconsistencies between observations in humans and in these animal models. We used African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate (NHP) model for a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of pairs of wild-type and pandemic live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (pLAIV) representing four subtypes of avian influenza viruses and found that pLAIVs replicate similarly in AGMs and humans and that AGMs can be useful for evaluation of the protective efficacy of pLAIV.","output":"African green monkeys recapitulate the clinical experience with replication of live attenuated pandemic influenza virus vaccine candidates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations.

Because fibrosis with persistent physiological deficit is a previously described feature of patients recovering from similar coronaviruses, treatment represents an early opportunity to modify the disease course, potentially preventing irreversible impairment. Objectives: Determine the incidence of and describe the progression of persistent inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD) following SARS-CoV-2 when treated with prednisolone. Methods: A structured assessment protocol screened for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis. Eight hundred thirty-seven patients were assessed by telephone 4 weeks after discharge. Those with ongoing symptoms had outpatient assessment at 6 weeks. Thirty patients diagnosed with persistent interstitial lung changes at a multidisciplinary team meeting were reviewed in the interstitial lung disease service and offered treatment. These patients had persistent, nonimproving symptoms. Results: At 4 weeks after discharge, 39% of patients reported ongoing symptoms (325/837) and were assessed. Interstitial lung disease, predominantly organizing pneumonia, with significant functional deficit was observed in 35/837 survivors (4.8%). Thirty of these patients received steroid treatment, resulting in a mean relative increase in transfer factor following treatment of 31.6% (standard deviation [SD]  27.6, P < 0.001), and forced vital capacity of 9.6% (SD  13.0, P = 0.014), with significant symptomatic and radiological improvement. Conclusions: Following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, a cohort of patients are left with both radiological inflammatory lung disease and persistent physiological and functional deficit. Early treatment with corticosteroids was well tolerated and associated with rapid and significant improvement.

However, the comorbidity of depression and pain has not been examined using network analysis, especially in the context of a pandemic. Thus, we mapped out the network connectivity among the symptoms of depression and pain in Wuhan residents in China during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from May 25, 2020 to June 18, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Participants' depressive and pain symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and a pain numeric rating scale (NRS), respectively. Network analyses were performed. RESULTS: In total, 2,598 participants completed all assessments. PHQ4 (fatigue) in the depression community showed the highest strength value, followed by PHQ6 (worthlessness) and PHQ2 (depressed or sad mood). PHQ4 (fatigue) was also the most key bridge symptom liking depression and pain, followed by PHQ3 (sleep difficulties). There were no significant differences in network global strength (females: 4.36 vs. males: 4.29; S = 0.075, P = 0.427), network structure-distribution of edge weights (M = 0.12, P = 0.541), and individual edge weights between male and female participants. CONCLUSION: Depressive and pain symptoms showed strong cross-association with each other. Fatigue was the strongest central and bridge symptom in the network model, while sleep difficulties was the second strongest bridge symptom.

This suggests that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for both epidemiological surveillance, and early warning for SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the population level. In this study we sampled an urban wastewater infrastructure in the city of Ashkelon, Israel, during the end of the first COVID-19 wave in May 2020 when the number of infections seemed to be waning. We were able to show varying presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from several locations in the city during two sampling periods. This was expressed as a new index, Normalized Viral Load (NVL), which can be used in different area scales to define levels of virus activity such as red (high) or green (no), and to follow morbidity in the population at tested area. Our index showed the rise in viral load between the two sampling periods (one week apart) and indicated an increase in morbidity that was evident a month later in the population.

These two viruses belong to two distinct species of the Alphacoronavirus genus within Coronaviridae and induce similar clinical signs and pathological lesions in newborn piglets, but they are presumed to be antigenically distinct. In the present study, two-way antigenic cross-reactivity examinations between the prototype PEDV CV777 strain, three distinct U.S. PEDV strains (the original highly virulent PC22A, S indel Iowa106, and S 197del PC177), and two representative U.S. TGEV strains (Miller and Purdue) were conducted by cell culture immunofluorescent (CCIF) and viral neutralization (VN) assays. None of the pig TGEV antisera neutralized PEDV and vice versa. One-way cross-reactions were observed by CCIF between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and all PEDV strains. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies and Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant PEDV and TGEV nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and sequence analysis suggested at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this cross-reactivity. Biologically, PEDV strain CV777 induced greater cell fusion in Vero cells than did U.S. PEDV strains. Consistent with the reported genetic differences, the results of CCIF and VN assays also revealed higher antigenic variation between PEDV CV777 and U.S. strains. IMPORTANCE Evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity between porcine enteric coronaviruses, PEDV and TGEV, in CCIF assays supports the idea that these two species are evolutionarily related, but they are distinct species defined by VN assays. Identification of PEDV- or TGEV-specific antigenic regions allows the development of more specific immunoassays for each virus. Antigenic and biologic variations between the prototype and current PEDV strains could explain, at least partially, the recurrence of PEDV epidemics. Information on the conserved antigenicity among PEDV strains is important for the development of PEDV vaccines to protect swine from current highly virulent PEDV infections.","output":"Antigenic relationships among porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus strains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Croplands are the single largest anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, yet their estimates remain difficult to verify when using Tier 1 and 3 methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Of particular concern will be the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these challenging times.

Thus, coronavirus is robbing people of the opportunity of a final farewell, stripping the dead of their dignity and worsening the grief of the living. This article investigates the situation and the social and cultural impact it has provoked. The method used takes the line of critical dialogue analysis (CDA) applied to information contained in the mass media, employing qualitative material from a related small-scale study. The results show that in countries like Spain where there is a strong Roman Catholic tradition the importance of these rituals is unquestionable. Although the country has become laicized over recent years, many traditions around death are still maintained. Hence, the impossibility of holding funerals is triggering a large number of social and personal conflicts. Furthermore, they indicate that lockdown, and the lack of rituals and of accompaniment constitute some of the most crucial stressors in the epidemic. Grief in solitude has become widespread and all the more fundamental in a society that values social support from close friends and family members.

By capturing concept and relationship hierarchies, our ontology-based approach allows us to pose general or specific questions about networks within the same framework. This approach can be applied to other research communities or multidimensional social networks to capture, analyze, and visualize different types of interactions and how they change over time.","output":"Ontology-Based Graphs of Research Communities: A Tool for Understanding Threat Reduction Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionWe are facing a crisis caused by an extremely infectious disease, Covid-19. The mechanisms of infection and transmission of this coronavirus are largely unknown but some of the clearer recommendations are washing hands and surfaces. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has a lifetime prevalence of 2-3%, among the multiple symptoms, fear of dirt or being contaminated, and excessive washing are the most common affecting about 50% of patients.ObjectivesWe reviewed the available information to understand if there are changes in OCD symptoms during the pandemic.MethodsNon-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the past 6 months;by searching Pubmed and Medscape databases using the combination of MeSH descriptors. The following MeSH terms were used: Covid-19;SARS-Cov2;pandemic;obsessive compulsive disorder;OCD.ResultsFrom a theoretical point of view, the increased frequency of hand washing and the importance of following hand-washing steps can add to a ritualistic pattern, also cleaning hands every time a person comes from outside or contacts with others can be justified as a preventive action rather than considered a problem and it can be normalized by others as a pandemic response.ConclusionsIn conclusion, there is evidence that during quarantine an overall increase in obsession and compulsion severity emerged with contamination symptoms associated with worse outcomes. There is data on an increase in relapses with patients not asking for help in a timely manner. The current situation is unpredictable and rapidly changing. It is likely that more information about this topic will arise in the next months.","output":"Washing COVID-19 away: COVID-19 and obsessive compulsive disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease have had an unprecedented spread and continue to cause an increasing number of fatalities worldwide. While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that \\"on-off\\" policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at \\"flattening\\" the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.","output":"Modeling, state estimation, and optimal control for the US COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT All who have experienced the global pandemic of 2020 can tell you that we live in a changed world. People no longer question whether we are in complexity, that reality has been made explicitly clear. What they want to know now is, what do we do about it, and what does it mean for how we need to lead differently? In this article I explore these questions by integrating generative emergence (Lichtenstein, B. [2014]. Generative emergence: A new discipline of organizational, entrepreneurial, and social innovation. Oxford University Press) and complexity leadership theory (CLT) (Uhl-Bien, M., Marion, R., & McKelvey, B. [2007].

Using COVID-19 as an example, I show how understanding complexity leadership theory as generative emergence can help us better understand how to lead differently in crisis and complexity.

It is possible that studying will not resemble anymore the process known by the previous generations of students. As the current generations learn by doing and use their intuition, new platforms need to be involved in the teaching process. The current paper proposes a new method to keep the students engaged while learning by involving neuroscience during the classes of Microcontrollers. Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards are studied at the course of Microcontrollers using online simulation environments. The Emotiv Insight headset is used by the professor during the theoretical and practical hours of the Microcontrollers course. The analysis performed on the brainwaves generated by the headset provides numerical values for the mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest levels of the professor. The approaches used during teaching were inquiry-based learning, game-based learning and personalized learning. In this way, professors can determine how to improve the connection with their students based on the use of technology and virtual simulation platforms. The results of the test show that the game-based learning was be best approach because students had to become problem solves and start to use the software skills which they will need as future software engineers. The emphasis is put on mastering the mindset by having to choose their actions and to experiment along the way. According to their achievement, students receive experience points in a gamified environment. Professors need to adjust to a new era of teaching and refine their practices and learning philosophy.

Mindfulness practices have been shown to be useful in lowering distress and burnout in clinical and non-clinical cohorts. Our aim was to explore the potential personal and occupational benefits of a structured mindfulness intervention on a cohort of mental health professionals. A mixed-methods approach was utilised in order to enhance the exploratory power of the study. Methods: We conducted a pilot study involving healthcare practitioners employed at a community outpatient mental health clinic. As a pilot, we relied on a single group and implemented a quasi-experimental, simultaneous mixed methods design by incorporating both quantitative pre- and post- testing alongside written qualitative post-test responses. Results: Analysis of the data demonstrated a significant difference between overall mindfulness when comparing post-test (mean=140.8, standard deviation=18.9) with pre-test data (mean=128.3, standard deviation=28.6). Participants also showed a statistically significant difference in three of the subscales: observation, describing, and non-reactivity. A moderate effect size was seen for each of the above differences. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed a range of potential themes which may be used to explain the differences exhibited across participants personal and professional lives, which can be grouped into two thematic overarching groups: emotional reactivity and listening/communicating. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that a structured, six-week mindfulness program has the potential to benefit clinicians, personally by reducing emotional reactivity and professionally by promoting deep listening and communication.","output":"The benefits of mindfulness in mental healthcare professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pediatric critical care patients with COVID-19 treated in Peru have higher mortality than those previously reported from other countries. Pediatric providers have reported a high number of patients without comorbidities presenting with hemorrhagic strokes associated with COVID-19. We present a study analyzing the factors associated with mortality in this setting. METHODS: Prospective case-control study that included patients <17 years old admitted to a pediatric critical care unit with a positive test confirming COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality. Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were admitted to critical care. The mortality of our study is 21.3%. The mortality of patients with neurological presentation was 45.5%, which was significantly higher than the mortality of acute COVID-19 (26.7%) and MIS-C (4.8%), p 0.18. Other risk factors for mortality in our cohort were strokes and comorbidities. Only one patient presenting with hemorrhagic stroke had an undiagnosed comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular events associated with COVID-19 in pediatric patients, including infants, must be recognized as one of the more severe presentations of this infection in pediatric patients. IMPACT: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 can present with hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes on presentation. Neurological presentation in pediatric patients with COVID-19 has high mortality. Mortality of pediatric patients with COVID-19 is associated with comorbidities.

Typical treatments include hemi or full laminectomy with durotomy and microsurgical resection which can result in secondary scarring, and recurrent blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow perpetuating the cycle. Case Description A 66-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening gait and memory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an arachnoid web in the high thoracic region, causing cerebrospinal fluid flow obstruction and hydrocephalus. A standard lumbar drainage catheter was introduced percutaneously into the lumbar thecal sac, and advanced in a cephalad direction, across the arachnoid web, to the high thoracic region. The patient underwent continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage through this catheter for a total of three days, displaying measurable clinical improvement that persisted at the three months follow up visit. Phase-contrast MRI demonstrated interval reconstitution of dorsal synchronous cerebrospinal fluid flow at the 2nd thoracic vertebral level, both on day three, as well as at the three months control imaging study. Conclusion This minimally invasive approach seems useful in achieving restoration of spinal fluid flow at the thoracic region when the underlying blockage results from an arachnoid web and leads to quantifiable clinical improvement.","output":"Percutaneous Fenestration of a Spinal Arachnoid Web Using an Intrathecal Catheter: Effect on Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow and Clinical Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why do we adopt new rules, such as social distancing? Although human sciences research stresses the key role of social influence in behaviour change, most COVID-19 campaigns emphasize the disease's medical threat. In a global data set (n = 6,674), we investigated how social influences predict people's adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Bayesian regression analyses controlling for stringency of local measures showed that people distanced most when they thought their close social circle did. Such social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing to do. People's adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens, but only if they felt deeply bonded with their country. Self-vulnerability to the disease predicted distancing more for people with larger social circles. Collective efficacy and collectivism also significantly predicted distancing.

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. METHODS: We constructed a globally representative sample of 802 genomes, including 46 samples from patients inside or with a travel history to Iran. We then performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify clades related to samples from Iran and estimated the start of the epidemic and early doubling times in cases. We leveraged air travel data from 36 exported cases of COVID-19 to estimate the point-prevalence and the basic reproductive number across the country. We also analysed the province-level all-cause mortality data during winter and spring 2020 to estimate under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths. Finally, we use this information in an SEIR model to reconstruct the early outbreak dynamics and assess the effectiveness of intervention measures in Iran. RESULTS: By identifying the most basal clade that contained genomes from Iran, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the age of the root is placed on 2019-12-21 (95 % HPD: 2019-09-07 - 2020-02-14). This date coincides with our estimated epidemic start date on 2019-12-25 (95 %CI: 2019-12-11 - 2020-02-24) based air travel data from exported cases with an early doubling time of 4.0 (95 %CI: 1.4-6.7) days in cases. Our analysis of all-cause mortality showed 21.9 (95 % CI: 16.7-27.2) thousand excess deaths by the end of summer. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggested that by 2020-08-31 a total of 15.0 (95 %CI: 4.9-25.0) million individuals recovered from the disease across the country. CONCLUSION: These findings have profound implications for assessing the stage of the epidemic in Iran despite significant levels of under-reporting. Moreover, the results shed light on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Iran and central Asia. They also suggest that in the absence of border screening, there is a high risk of introduction from travellers from areas with active outbreaks. Finally, they show both that well-informed epidemic models are able to forecast episodes of resurgence following a relaxation of interventions, and that NPIs are key to controlling ongoing epidemics.","output":"Lessons for preparedness and reasons for concern from the early COVID-19 epidemic in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Hospitals are a key component to disaster response but are susceptible to the effects of disasters as well, including infrastructure damage that disrupts patient care.

METHODS AMERICA is a prospective multicenter 100 aneurysm observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Axium MicroFX PGLA coils. Enrollment was started in April 2010 and completed in October 2012. RESULTS 99 patients underwent treatment for 100 aneurysms at 13 centers. Mean age was 60.2 years, most were women (72%) and 18% of patients had previously undergone treatment for a separate aneurysm. 22% of patients underwent treatment after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of these patients, all were Hunt and Hess grade 1-3. Pre-procedure modified Rankin score (mRS) was 0-2 in 92% of patients. The majority of aneurysms were anterior circulation (86%), with the most common aneurysm locations being the anterior communicating artery (23%) followed by the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and posterior communicating artery (18% each). The mean maximum diameter was 6.5 mm. Axium MicroFX coils could be placed in all but one treatment (99%). Raymond grade at conclusion of coiling was I (complete) in 52%, II (dog ear or residual neck) in 33% and III (residual aneurysm) in 15%. Discharge mRS was significantly worse in patients with SAH (62% mRS 0-2) compared with electively treated aneurysms (mRS 0-2 in 94%, p<001). Major events were uncommon (6% thromboembolic events, 3% intraoperative vessel or aneurysm rupture) and device-related adverse events (AE) were rare (2% of cases).

However, ASC research has two major knowledge gaps that hinder progression in understanding the concept of ASC and in providing proper support for autistic adults: (1) the majority of knowledge about ASC mainly stems from childhood studies so little is known about older autistic adults and (2) while it is broadly recognised that ASC is a heterogeneous condition, we do not yet understand the differences in trajectories leading to their future outcome. We aim to fill both knowledge gaps. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multistage overlapping cohort design assessing (cognitive) ageing in ASC is designed to obtain an accelerated longitudinal data set. Data, including a multitude of questionnaires, diagnostics and cognitive tests, are collected over four waves within a 10-year time frame. This will provide information regarding actual changes in quality of life, co-occurring health conditions and cognition as well as the possibility to test external validity and temporal stability in newly formed behavioural subtypes.

Ancient Greeks understood harmony as an agreement of opposites. A surge of interest in the study of the harmonic aspects of being occurred in the twentieth century due to the development of systems science, particularly regarding synergetic system effects. At the same time, there are still relatively few applications of synergetics because of the absence of an accurate methodology for the identification of system harmonicity. The aim of this research is to develop the methodology for the quantitative assessment of system harmonicity by considering a practical example: the quantitative assessment of the harmonicity of the road safety provision system (RSS) and its dynamics during the last 15 years (2006C2020). In addition, the impact of the COVID restrictions on population mobility in Russia in 2020, on the change in the harmonicity of the road safety provision system, is considered. During the research it was established that the quality factor g of the Russian road safety provision system changed from g2006 = 1.9565 to g2020 = 2.4646, which promoted the decline of the relative entropy of the Russian road safety provision system from Hn RSS 2006 = 0.8623 to Hn RSS 2020 = 0.7553. The deep reason for that change was the modification of relation between weights or the significance of the contribution of different elements of the cause-and-effect chain in the formation of the factual level of the road accident rate in Russia in the last 15 years. The main conclusion of this research is that the harmonicity of the Russian road safety provision system, assessed by the normalized functional general utility GUn, has been increased, and it has already exceeded the level of harmonious reference systems GUn = 0.618. In fact, the normalized functional general utility GUnof the Russian road safety provision system increased from GUn RSS 2006 = 0.615 to GUn RSS 2020 = 0.652 (by 6.0%), from 2006 to 2020. Simultaneously, the share of the normalized used resource Xn declined, allowing a conclusion to be drawn about a significant improvement in the balance efficiency-quality of the Russian road safety provision system.

By phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV is distinct from known CoVs and most closely related to group 2 CoVs. However, no antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and known CoVs was conclusively and consistently demonstrated except for group 1 animal CoVs. We analyzed this cross-reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis using specific antisera to animal CoVs and SARS-CoV and SARS patient convalescent-phase or negative sera. Moderate two-way cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and porcine CoVs (transmissible gastroenteritis CoV [TGEV] and porcine respiratory CoV [PRCV]) was mediated through the N but not the spike protein, whereas weaker cross-reactivity occurred with feline (feline infectious peritonitis virus) and canine CoVs. Using Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV N protein and fragments, the cross-reactive region was localized between amino acids (aa) 120 to 208. The N-protein fragments comprising aa 360 to 412 and aa 1 to 213 reacted specifically with SARS convalescent-phase sera but not with negative human sera in ELISA; the fragment comprising aa 1 to 213 cross-reacted with antisera to animal CoVs, whereas the fragment comprising aa 360 to 412 did not cross-react and could be a potential candidate for SARS diagnosis. Particularly noteworthy, a single substitution at aa 120 of PRCV N protein diminished the cross-reactivity. We also demonstrated that the cross-reactivity is not universal for all group 1 CoVs, because HCoV-NL63 did not cross-react with SARS-CoV. One-way cross-reactivity of HCoV-NL63 with group 1 CoVs was localized to aa 1 to 39 and at least one other antigenic site in the N-protein C terminus, differing from the cross-reactive region identified in SARS-CoV N protein. The observed cross-reactivity is not a consequence of a higher level of amino acid identity between SARS-CoV and porcine CoV nucleoproteins, because sequence comparisons indicated that SARS-CoV N protein has amino acid identity similar to that of infectious bronchitis virus N protein and shares a higher level of identity with bovine CoV N protein within the cross-reactive region. The TGEV and SARS-CoV N proteins are RNA chaperons with long disordered regions. We speculate that during natural infection, antibodies target similar short antigenic sites within the N proteins of SARS-CoV and porcine group 1 CoVs that are exposed to an immune response. Identification of the cross-reactive and non-cross-reactive N-protein regions allows development of SARS-CoV-specific antibody assays for screening animal and human sera.","output":"Two-way antigenic cross-reactivity between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and group 1 animal CoVs is mediated through an antigenic site in the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The centrality of personal experience plays a pivotal role in feminist scholarship We draw on the feminist inspired collaborative inquiry research method, memory\\\\work, to bring to the fore our experiences of living and working in lockdown, a Government enforced policy response to the global Covid\\\\19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand Memory\\\\work provided the conduit for us to work collaboratively with our experiences and make sense of the whirlwind we lived through Our exploration is set against the backdrop of the challenges of the conservatism endemic in the neoliberal pathway taken in NZ and its transmission into the university sector Through our collective editing of each account generated by the phrase her murky boundaries of lockdown two interconnected themes came to the fore in various guises: restricted and vulnerable Using  collective she and her, we reconstruct and analyze the nuances of our shared experiences revealing layers of gendered vulnerability paradoxically intertwined with privilege at this unprecedented time We conclude by arguing that lockdown exacerbated already existing divisions reinforcing how female, feminist, and academic remain an uncomfortable fit [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Gender, Work & Organization is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Privileged yet vulnerable: Shared memories of a deeply gendered lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Pharmacists play a pivotal role in tackling Antimicrobial resistance through antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and are well placed to lead behaviour change interventions across the healthcare system; (2) Methods: A cross-sector AMS training initiative for pharmacists was implemented across England, with three cohorts between 2019C2021. Each cohort took part in an introductory workshop, followed- by a workplace-based quality improvement project supported by peer-assisted learning sessions. Completion of training was determined by an end of training assessment after three to four months. Outcome data and learner survey results were collated, anonymised, and analysed by the training provider. (3) Results: In total, 118 pharmacists participated in the introductory workshop, 70% of these subsequently undertook an improvement project, and 48% engaged workplace stakeholders in the process. Interventions were designed by 57% of learners and 18% completed a at least one Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Approximately a quarter of learners met the requirements for a Certificate of Completion. Knowledge quiz scores were obtained from 115 learners pre-training and 28 learners post-training.

In the present studies, we have contributed to the development of a drug based on natural products to combat the newly emerged and life-threatening disease. The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a homodimer and a key component involved in viral replication, and is considered as a prime target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Literature survey revealed that the phytochemicals present in Strychnos nux-vomica possess several therapeutic activities. Initially, in the light of drug likeness laws, the ligand library of phytoconstituents was subjected to drug likeness analysis. The resulting compounds were taken to binding site-specific consensus-based molecular docking studies and the results were compared with the positive control drug, lopinavir, which is a main protease inhibitor. The top compounds were tested for ADME-Tox properties and antiviral activity. Further molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA-based binding affinity estimation were carried out for top two lead compounds' complexes along with the apo form of main protease and positive control drug lopinavir complex, and the results were comparatively analysed.

In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective respondents' assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience with the hexarotor.

Bone graft substitutes can contribute to the addition of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to enhance the rate and the quality of defect regeneration. The stem cell secretome contains many growth factors and chemokines, which could affect cellular characteristics and behavior. Conditioned medium (CM) could be used in tissue regeneration avoiding several problems linked to the direct use of MSCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and their CM on bone regeneration using a commercially available membrane scaffold Evolution (EVO) implanted in rat calvarias. EVO alone or EVO + hPDLSCs with or without CM were implanted in Wistar male rats subjected to calvarial defects. The in vivo results revealed that EVO membrane enriched with hPDLSCs and CM showed a better osteogenic ability to repair the calvarial defect. These results were confirmed by acquired micro-computed tomography (CT) images and the increased osteopontin levels. Moreover, RT-PCR in vitro revealed the upregulation of three genes (Collagen (COL)5A1, COL16A1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)1) and the down regulation of 26 genes involved in bone regeneration.

Methods: Patient representatives assisted in the development of a user-friendly questionnaire. With patient consent, the questionnaire was distributed via email to patients attending clinics between 28th AugustC25th September 2020. Results: Of the 142 patients who consented to receiving a questionnaire, 61 (43%) responded. 90% (n = 55) of PwCF were satisfied with their telephone physiotherapy review. 33% (n = 20) of PwCF were not aware they would be called by a physiotherapist. 93% (n = 57) of PwCF found it useful to speak to a physiotherapist, covering the same (topics) as a face-to-face review.

This heralded the beginning of an uncertain future for museums and galleries as the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the only means to stay open was to turn towards the digital. In this paper, we investigate how the physical closure of museum buildings due to lockdown restrictions caused shockwaves within their digital strategies and changed their data practices potentially for good. The methodology of the research involves a review of the impact of COVID-19 on the museum sector, based on literature and desk research, with a focus on the implications for three museums and art galleries in the United Kingdom and the United States, and their mission, objectives, and digital data practices. We also present analysis of ten qualitative interviews with expert witnesses working in the sector, representing different roles and types of institutions, undertaken between April and October 2020. Our research finds that digital engagement with museum content and practices around data in institutions have changed and that digital methods for organising and accessing collections for both staff and the general public have become more important. We present evidence that strategic preparedness influenced how well institutions were able to transition during closure and that metrics data became pivotal in understanding this novel situation. Increased engagement online changed traditional audience profiles, challenging museums to find ways of accommodating new forms of engagement in order to survive and thrive in the post-pandemic environment. Our findings point to a longer term shift in the operating models for museums and the need to realise economic value and diversify income streams through digital means, which have not yet been clearly established. The research suggests that the unprecedented situation brought on by the pandemic will shape future museum audiences and their interactions with institutions virtually and physically, posing challenges to museums and their constituents that require structural changes and adaptations, but also present opportunities to successfully survive in an ever-more connected world.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on digital data practices in museums and art galleries in the UK and the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, our aim was to isolate and characterize SARS-CoV-2 from Indian patients.

This fits into a burgeoning ecological paradigm suggesting that for both predatorCprey and parasiteChost interactions, non-consumptive effects (avoidance) can be orders of magnitude stronger than consumptive effects (sickness and death). Just as avoidance of predators and parasites imposes substantial costs on prey and hosts, altered behaviour to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 has impacted human fitness and wellbeing. But the effects of infectious disease avoidance do not stop there; non-consumptive effects of predators and parasites often trigger cascading indirect effects in natural systems. Similarly, shifts in human behaviour due to COVID-19 have triggered myriad indirect effects on species and the environment, which can be positive, negative or neutral. We urge researchers to recognize that the environmental impacts associated with lockdowns are indirect effects of the virus.

Methods: We present the case of a 41-year-old man, admitted to our Department due to multiple generalized convulsions since the early hours on the day of admission. He had a 20-year history of epileptic seizures, after sustaining head trauma in a car accident. He was taking valproate long-term, with poor adherence, and carbamazepine for 6 months. On admission the patient had full consciousness, and the neurological examination, blood pressure and blood glucose test were normal. His body temperature was 38.8C. Results: An infectious cause of fever was investigated. A complete laboratory and imaging examination (WBC, ESR, CRP, liver biochemical tests, blood and urine cultures, PCR for SARS-CoV-2, CXR) was performed. Tests returned normal or negative, ruling out an infection. Brain CT revealed a porencephalic lesion on the left occipital lobe and signs of a craniotomy on the right temporal side. EEG showed slow theta activity in the left temporo-occipital area. The fever resolved spontaneously in about 12 h. Conclusions: Fever is a well-known seizure-inducing factor, but an infrequent condition in post-ictal period. It is hypothesized that this symptom is a consequence of peri-ictal repetitive muscular contractions and disturbance of homeostasis in generalized convulsive seizures.

Forty-six (16%) samples were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with CRC, compared with 26 (9.1%) in the healthy controls, a significant difference (P = 0.007). By contrast, eight (2.8%) patients tested positive for T. gondii IgM antibodies, compared with three (1.1%) in the controls, a difference that was not significant (P = 0.13).

CONCLUSION Percutaneous TIVAD inserted into the IJV by an SR was demonstrated to be safe.","output":"Safety of Insertion of Percutaneous Totally Implantable Central Venous Access Devices by Surgical Residents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Real-world clinical data suggest an attenuated short-term humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) receiving high efficacy (HE) disease modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Ocrelizumab (OCR) and Fingolimod (FNG). Long-term humoral response in pwMS treated with these HE-DMTs has been poorly investigated. The aim of our study was to explore: i) the humoral response up to six months after a full cycle of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in pwMS treated with OCR and FNG and to compare it to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs); ii) the relationship between humoral response and clinical and immunological characteristics of the studied population. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from HCs and pwMS treated with OCR or FNG at the following time points: before BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (T0), and 4 (T1), 8 (T2), 16 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after the first dose. Sera were stored at ?20 C and tested for the quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein (Anti-TSP IgG) expressed in binding antibody units (BAU). At T1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) titres were assessed. The relationship between Anti-TSP IgG at each time-point and clinical and laboratoristic analyses were analysed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: 47 HCs and 50 pwMS (28 on OCR and 22 on FNG) were included in the study. All HCs mounted a positive humoral response at T1 and preserved it up to six months. At T1 only 57.1% pwMS on OCR (p < 0.001 compared with HCs) and 40.9% on FNG (p < 0.001) had a positive humoral response at T1, with only 39.3% and 27.3% maintaining a positive response at sixth months (T4), respectively. A strong positive correlation was observed between Nabs titres and Anti-TSP IgG at T1 (rho 0.87, p < 0.0001) with NAbs titres significantly higher in HCs compared with pwMS on OCR and FNG (p<0.0001). We also found a strong positive correlation between time-window since last OCR infusion and anti-TSP IgG titres at all time-points (T1 rho=0.58, p = 0.001; T2 rho=0.59, p = 0.001; T3 rho=0.53, p = 0.004; T4 rho=0.47, p = 0.01). In the FNG group we observed a significant correlation between the humoral response measured from T1 to T4 and: i) treatment duration (T1: rho -0.65, p = 0.001; T2: rho -0.8 p< 0.001; T3: rho -0.72, p=<0.001; T4: rho -0.67, p<0.001), ii) disease duration (T1: rho -0.5, p = 0.017; T2: rho -0.6, p = 0.003; T3: rho -0.58, p = 0.005; T4: rho -0.57, p = 0.006), and iii) baseline total lymphocyte count (T1: rho 0.37, p = 0.08; T2: rho 0.45, p = 0.03; T3: rho 0.43, p = 0.04; T4: rho 0.45, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term data show a weakened and short-lasting humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in pwMS treated with OCR and FNG when compared with HCs. MS neurologists should take into account the time elapsed since the last infusion for pwMS on OCR, and the lymphocyte count as well as the disease and treatment duration for those on FNG when called to counsel such pwMS regarding the vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.","output":"Six-month humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab and fingolimod"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dual cinchona quinuclidinium salts with a diphenyl ether linker were synthesized and used as powerful asymmetric phase transfer catalysts in the -alkylation of imines of glycine and alanine ester with 0.01-0.1 mol% loading (17 examples, 92-99% ee).

We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and the duration of shedding of fecal RNA in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese databases Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data up to June 2020 were searched for studies evaluating fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including anal and rectal samples, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in patients with detectable respiratory RNA was estimated. The days of shedding and days to loss of fecal and respiratory RNA from presentation were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (N = 1,636) met criteria. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in COVID-19 patients was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34%-52%). Higher proportion of patients with GI symptoms (52.4% vs 25.9%, odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) compared with no GI symptoms, specifically diarrhea (51.6% vs 24.0%, odds ratio = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8), had detectable fecal RNA. After loss of respiratory RNA, 27% (95% CI 15%-44%) of the patients had persistent shedding of fecal RNA. Days of RNA shedding in the feces were longer than respiratory samples (21.8 vs 14.7 days, mean difference = 7.1 days, 95% CI 1.2-13.0). Furthermore, days to loss of fecal RNA lagged respiratory RNA by a mean of 4.8 days (95% CI 2.2-7.5).

This paper explores how different types of places--activity spaces at micro-level and human settlements at macro-level--impact the transmission of infections using evidences from COVID-19. We examine eleven types of activity spaces and find heterogeneous impacts across countries, yet we also find that non-essential activity spaces tend to have larger impacts than essential ones. Contrary to common beliefs, settlement size and density are not positively associated with reproduction numbers. Further, the impacts of closing activity spaces vary with settlement types and are consistently lower in larger settlements in all sample countries, suggesting more complex pattern of virus transmission in large settlements. This work takes first steps in systematically evaluating the epistemological risks of places at multiple scales, which contributes to knowledge in urban resilience, health and livability. TeaserActivity spaces and human settlement characteristics impact the spread of epidemics in multiple ways and should be considered in policy making.","output":"Infectiousness of places: The impact of human settlement and activity space in the transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-invasive strategies such as HFOT (high-flow oxygen therapy), CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and NIV (non-invasive ventilation) are increasingly being used during the COVID-19 pandemics in order to treat acute hypoxemic respiratory failure related to COVID-19, and this is aimed at avoiding intubation. This review article summarizes the current evidence by also emphasizing its heterogeneity. Importantly, current evidence suggests that these non-invasive strategies can be successfully used even in case of severe respiratory failure and are, thus, indeed capable of avoiding intubation, and consequently, tube-related complications. In contrast, it also remains to be emphasized that prolonged spontaneous breathing supported by non-invasive treatment strategies is also prone to complications. In particular, late NIV failure is associated with substantially deteriorated outcome, which is suggested to be meaningful in view of NIV failure rates still being high in Germany. Finally, the current article also refers to a parallel article that addresses the discussion being held in the public media in Germany concerning this topic. Here, its textual questionability, but also its negative consequences for both the research community and the general society are elaborated.

Mean blood pressure and the prevalence of raised blood pressure have declined substantially in high-income regions since at least the 1970s. By contrast, blood pressure has risen in East, South and Southeast Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. Given these trends, the prevalence of hypertension is now higher in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. In 2015, an estimated 8.5 million deaths were attributable to systolic blood pressure >115 mmHg, 88% of which were in low-income and middle-income countries. Measures such as increasing the availability and affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables, lowering the sodium content of packaged and prepared food and staples such as bread, and improving the availability of dietary salt substitutes can help lower blood pressure in the entire population. The use and effectiveness of hypertension treatment vary substantially across countries. Factors influencing this variation include a countrys financial resources, the extent of health insurance and health facilities, how frequently people interact with physicians and non-physician health personnel, whether a clear and widely adopted clinical guideline exists and the availability of medicines.

Using the fundamental energy parameters of a quantum system, it is possible to determine with a high accuracy its quantitative and qualitative composition. Among the most efficient tools to measure energy characteristics of quantum systems are sensors based on Yanson point contacts. This paper reports the results of serotonin and melatonin detection as an example of testing the human hormonal background with point-contact sensors, which have already demonstrated their high efficiency in detecting carcinogenic strains of Helicobacter pylori and selective detection of complex gas mixtures. When comparing the values of serotonin and melatonin with the characteristic parameters of the spectral profile of the exhaled breath of each patient, high correlation dependences of the concentration of serotonin and melatonin with a number of characteristic parameters of the response curve of the point-contact sensor were found. The performed correlation analysis was complemented with the regression analysis. As a result, empiric regression relations were proposed to realize in practice the new non-invasive breath test for evaluation of the human hormonal background. Registration of the patient's breath profile using point-contact sensors makes it possible to easily monitor the dynamics of changes in the human hormonal background and perform a quantitative evaluation of serotonin and melatonin levels in the human body in real time without invasive interventions (blood collection) and expensive equipment or reagents.","output":"Noninvasive real-time breath test for controlling hormonal background of the human body: Detection of serotonin and melatonin with quantum point-contact sensors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In high-income countries, such as Canada, 50% of health outcomes are attributable to social determinants.

OBJECTIVES: To study the percentage sero-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 to understand the pandemic status and deriving conclusions for guiding the public health measures for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional sero-surveillance. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Large scale sero-surveillance with population-based stratified sampling covering more than 10,000 samples from general population of Ahmedabad was carried out during second half of August 2020. The seropositivity was correlated and compared with various demographic factors and other parameters for valid and precise predictions on the immunity status of the population. RESULTS: With 2,396 samples positive for IgG antibodies from a total of 10,310 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 in the general population of Ahmedabad is around 23.24%. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (25.37%) than males (21.81%). The zone wise positivity ranged from 11.74% to 33.14%.

We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial \\"cytokine storm\\", as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian \\"resetting\\" of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway.

In a professional setting, particularly in health caredepartments during the COVID-19 pandemic, empathy becomes a necessary tool in the care of patients. During theCOVID-19 pandemic, a new wave of stress, anxiety and fear has been experienced by all patients, which posesnew challenges for health care professionals who work closely with patients on a daily basis. Here, we discuss theimportance of empathy training of nuclear medicine technologists, and how we can better improve the experienceand care of our patients through methods which implement empathy in the nuclear medicine department. Methods: There are three components of empathy: cognitive, affective and behavioral. Cognitive refers to the abilityto view the perspective of others;in other words, putting oneself in another's shoes. The affective component refers to experiencing the feelings of others. The behavioral component involves communication to reflect understandingof another's feelings;therefore, it must be perceived that one person understands another in a meaningful way. Inempathy training, not all components are necessary to master in order to express empathy. Empathy can still beexperienced by patients even if only one of the components are met. Empathy training is effective and can beenhanced through didactic training and experiential techniques, whereby the student gains insight and educationabout empathy through lectures on empathy theories, followed by experience, whether simulated or in the form of agame. Skill training is another effective method, whereby students are given a list of skills to learn, the skills aremodeled for the students, and finally the students practice performing such skills. Results: Nuclear medicine technologists should actively practice empathy in the workplace, which involves theaction of active listening, framing, reflecting back to the patient, identifying emotions, and looking for feedback.Patients who interact with empathetic medical professionals feel understood, respected, and validated. Thispromotes patient satisfaction, enhances the quantity and quality of clinical data, improves adherence, and fostersbetter relationships. Conclusions: Empathy training is an essential and necessary component to the training ofhealth care professionals, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are scared and anxious, and usingempathy training to our advantage may help alleviate these fears in our patients during such a difficult time. Byimplementing empathy training techniques, technologists will be better able to make patients comfortable and lessenfears during imaging.","output":"no hard feelings: Empathy training for nuclearmedicine technologists: A review and methods ofimprovement during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital health technologies, such as smartphones and wearable devices, promise to revolutionize disease prevention, detection, and treatment.

BYOD study design accelerates the collection of data from a larger number of participants than cohort design; this is possible because researchers are not limited in the study population size based on the number of devices afforded by their budget or the number of people familiar with the technology.

The main protease (Mpro), which cleaves the polyprotein to form non-structural proteins, thereby helping in the replication of SARS-CoV-2, appears as an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. As FDA-approved drugs have shown effectiveness in targeting Mpro in previous SARS-CoV(s), molecular docking and virtual screening of existing antiviral, antimalarial, and protease inhibitor drugs were carried out against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among 53 shortlisted drugs with binding energies lower than that of the crystal-bound inhibitor -ketoamide 13 b (?6.7 kcal/mol), velpatasvir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir, baloxavir marboxil, danoprevir, nelfinavir, and indinavir (?9.1 to ?7.5 kcal/mol) were the most significant on the list (hereafter referred to as the 53-list). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of their Mpro complexes, with the MMPBSA binding free energy (G(bind)) ranging between ?124 kJ/mol (glecaprevir) and ?28.2 kJ/mol (velpatasvir). Despite having the lowest initial binding energy, velpatasvir exhibited the highest G(bind) value for escaping the catalytic site during the MD simulations, indicating its reduced efficacy, as observed experimentally. Available inhibition assay data adequately substantiated the computational forecast. Glecaprevir and nelfinavir (G(bind) = ?95.4 kJ/mol) appear to be the most effective antiviral drugs against Mpro. Furthermore, the remaining FDA drugs on the 53-list can be worth considering, since some have already demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, theoretical pK(i) (K(i) = inhibitor constant) values for all 53 drugs were provided. Notably, G(bind) directly correlates with the average distance of the drugs from the His41CCys145 catalytic dyad of Mpro, providing a roadmap for rapid screening and improving the inhibitor design against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Repurposing of FDA-approved drugs as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease: Molecular insights into improved therapeutic discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current research has shown that young adults are at the greatest risk of loneliness during the pandemic.

The analytic sample included 419 young adults (296 females; 123 males). Growth curve modelling revealed a U-shape longitudinal trend in self-reported loneliness, with a sharp rise during the winter months under the national lockdown. Young adults with long-standing physical or mental health conditions were more likely to report feeling lonely. Those with a lower household income and who were unemployed or not in school reported higher levels of loneliness. Gender was found to moderate the association between self-reported emotional support and loneliness. While greater emotional support was associated with less loneliness in males, no association was shown for females. The current findings add to our understanding of how the pandemic has affected the mental health of young adults and the differential effect of emotional support as a potential coping strategy for males and females.","output":"The trajectory of loneliness in UK young adults during the summer to winter months of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building public trust and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is as important as developing an effective vaccine.

Unexpectedly, mesenteric arteries from elastin insufficient (Eln(+/?)) mice were shown to have significant vasoconstriction to AT(2)R agonism in vitro suggesting that AT(2)R may have vasoconstrictor effects in elastin insufficiency. Given the potential promise for the use of AT(2)R agonists clinically, the goal of this study was to determine whether AT(2)R has vasoconstrictive effects in elastin insufficiency in vivo. To avoid off-target effects of agonists and antagonists, mice lacking AT(2)R (Agtr2(?/Y)) were bred to Eln(+/?) mice and cardiovascular parameters were assessed in wild-type (WT), Agtr2(?/Y), Eln(+/?), and Agtr2(?/Y);Eln(+/?) littermates. As previously published, Agtr2(?/Y) mice were normotensive at baseline and had no large artery stiffness, while Eln(+/?) mice exhibited systolic hypertension and large artery stiffness. Loss of AT(2)R in Eln(+/?) mice did not affect large artery stiffness or arterial structure but resulted in significant reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These data support a potential vasocontractile role for AT(2)R in elastin insufficiency.

The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular test run on an instrument with a small footprint enabling point-of-care diagnostics. MethodsIn the first wave, outsourced RT-PCR testing regularly required 36-48 hours before results were available. This prospective study was conducted in the second wave (October 2020-April 2021) and evaluated the impact the implementation of the ID NOW COVID-19 test in the ED had on clinical care processes and patient pathways. 710 patients were recruited upon arrival at the ED which included those presenting clinical symptoms, asymptomatic individuals or persons fulfilling epidemiological criteria. The first anterior nasal swab was taken by trained nurses in the ambulance or a separate consultation room. The ID NOW COVID-19 test was performed in the ED in strict compliance with the manufacturers instructions and positive or suspected cases were additionally tested with RT_PCR (cobas SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR, Roche) following collection of a second nasopharyngeal NP specimen. ResultsSwabs directly tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 test showed a diagnostic concordance of 98 % (sensitivity 99.59 %, specificity 94.55 %, PPV 97.6 %, NPV 99.05 %) compared to RT-PCR as reference. The 488 patients that tested positive with the ID NOW COVID-19 had a Ct range in RT-PCR results between 7.94 to 37.42 (in 23.2 % > 30). Two false negative results (0.28%) were recorded from patients with Ct values > 30. 14 (1.69%) discordant results were reviewed case-by-case and usually associated with either very early or very advanced stages of infection. Furthermore, patients initially negative with the ID NOW COVID-19 test and admitted to the hospital were tested again on days 5 and 12: no patient became positive. DiscussionThe ID NOW COVID-19 test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated excellent diagnostic agreement with RT-PCR under the above-mentioned patients pathways implemented during the second wave. The main advantage of the system was the provision of reliable results within a few minutes. This not only allowed immediate initiative of appropriate therapy and care for COVID-19 (patient benefit) but provided essential information on isolation and thus available beds. This drastically helped the overall finances of the department and additionally allowed more patients to be admitted including those requiring immediate attention; this was not possible during the first wave since beds were blocked waiting for diagnostic confirmation. Our findings also show that when interpreting the results, the clinical condition and epidemiological history of the patient must be taken into account, as with any test procedure. Overall, the ID NOW COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 provided a rapid and reliable alternative to laboratory-based RT-PCR in the real clinical setting which became an acceptable part of the daily routine within the ED and demonstrated that early patient management can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the hospital.","output":"Molecular point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2 using the ID NOW(TM) System in Emergency Department: Prospective Evaluation and Implementation in the Care Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies hypothesized that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) infectivity. However, it is unknown whether there is an association between ADT and a higher survival in prostate cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prostate cancer (PC) patients hospitalized to treat COVID-19 in Brazils public health system. We compared patients with the active use of ADT versus those with non-active ADT, past use. We constructed propensity score models of patients in active versus non-active use of ADT. All variables were used to derive propensity score estimation in both models. In the first model we performed a pair-matched propensity score model between those under active and non-active use of ADT. To the second model we initially performed a multivariate backward elimination process to select variables to a final inverse-weight adjusted with double robust estimation model. RESULTS: We analyzed 199 PC patients with COVID-19 that received ADT. In total, 52.3% (95/199) of our patients were less than 75 years old, 78.4% (156/199) were on active ADT, and most were using a GnRH analog (80.1%; 125/156). Most of patients were in palliative treatment (89.9%; 179/199). Also, 63.3% of our cohort died from COVID-19. Forty-eight patients under active ADT were pair matched against 48 controls (non-active ADT). All patients (199) were analyzed in the double robust model. ADT active use were not protective factor in both inverse-weight based propensity score (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38C1.31, P = 0.263), and pair-matched propensity score (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.27C1.63, P = 0.374) models. We noticed a significant imbalance in the propensity score of patients in active and those in non-active ADT, with important reductions in the differences after the adjustments.

Major group human rhinovirus enters cells by binding to the cell surface molecule ICAM-1 that is present on epithelial and monocytic lineage cells. The focus of the resulting viral infection is in bronchial epithelia. However, previous studies of the cytokine dysregulation that follows rhinovirus infection have implicated monocytic lineage cells in establishing the inflammatory environment even though productive infection is not a result. We have determined that human alveolar macrophages and human peripheral blood monocytes release MCP-1 upon exposure to human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16). Indeed, we have found p38 MAPK activation in human alveolar macrophages within 15 min of exposure to HRV16, and this activation lasts up to 1 h. The targets of p38 MAPK activation include transcriptional activators of the MCP-1 promoter. The transcription factor ATF-2, a p38 MAPK substrate, is phosphorylated 45 min after HRV16 exposure. Furthermore, IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is degraded. Prevention of HRV16 binding was effective in blocking p38 MAPK activation, ATF-2 phosphorylation, and MCP-1 release. This is the first report of a relationship between HRV16 exposure, MCP-1 release and monocytic-lineage cells suggesting that MCP-1 plays a role in establishing the inflammatory microenvironment initiated in the human airway upon exposure to rhinovirus.","output":"The role of p38 MAPK in rhinovirus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production by monocytic-lineage cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus transcription leads to the synthesis of a nested set of mRNAs with a leader sequence derived from the 5' end of the genome.

Vaccination has proven effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as death and hospitalisation following COVID-19 illness. However, little is known about the effect of vaccination on other acute and post-acute outcomes of COVID-19. Methods. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients mostly in the USA). Using a retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we compared the incidences of COVID-19 outcomes between individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine (approved for use in the USA) at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection and propensity score-matched individuals unvaccinated for COVID-19 but who had received an influenza vaccine. Outcomes were ICD-10 codes representing documented COVID-19 sequelae in the 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (recorded between January 1 and August 31, 2021). Associations with the number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2) and age (< 60 vs. [] 60 years-old) were assessed. Findings. Among 10,024 vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9479 were matched to unvaccinated controls. Receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was associated with a significantly lower risk of respiratory failure, ICU admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, and hair loss (each as composite endpoints with death to account for competing risks; HR 0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p<.05), but not other outcomes, including long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Receiving 2 vaccine doses was associated with lower risks for most outcomes. Associations between prior vaccination and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were marked in those < 60 years-old, whereas no robust associations were observed in those [] 60 years-old. Interpretation. COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower risk of several, but not all, COVID-19 sequelae in those with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. These benefits of vaccination were clear in younger people but not in the over-60s. The findings may inform service planning, contribute to forecasting public health impacts of vaccination programmes, and highlight the need to identify additional interventions for COVID-19 sequelae.

The qualitative part involved in-depth interviews to explore the perceptions towards the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. RESULT: Among 557 participantes, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 63.9% (95% CI: 59.8-67.9). In the adjusted analysis, three factors affected vaccine hesitancy: education (aOR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.22-0.70), knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (aOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.41-3.34) and willingness to pay (aOR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.07-0.20).

RESULTS: Our survey was completed on April 3, 2020, and was well-received (661 completed, 60.7% response rate, 96 nations). Neurosurgeons in affluent nations still lacked adequate resources to combat this pandemic primarily due to lack of preparedness and insufficient medical equipment. The challenges to lower-income nations were similar but also included knowledge dissemination and inadequate resources. Hospital preparedness was central to effective healthcare delivery but also influenced the cancellation of surgeries and clinics.

SETTING MBSAQIP national database. METHODS The MBSAQIP registry was queried for patients undergoing SG or RYGB (2015-2017) and patients grouped as AMB/non-AMB. Exclusion criteria included LoS >4 days, age <18 or >75 years, revision surgery, gastric banding, body mass index <35 kg/m2, and day of surgery mortality. Variables were combined into major/minor complications and 30-day mortality. Analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and propensity matching. RESULTS After exclusions were applied 408,895 patients remained (9973 AMB). Overall, 111,279 patients underwent RYGB (1032 AMB) and 297,616 underwent SG (8941 AMB), with similar demographic characteristics and co-morbidities between groups. For AMB patients, there was no increase in 30-day mortality, reoperation, or readmission, and fewer drains were placed versus matched non-AMB patients. In AMB-SG patients more surgical site infections were reported versus non-AMB-SG, although AMB-SG patients had fewer intensive care unit admissions. For AMB-RYGB, no differences in complications were detected versus non-AMB-RYGB. CONCLUSION Based on our analysis of the MBSAQIP database, patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB or SG procedures can be safely discharged on the day of their procedure without increased incidence of mortality, reoperation, or readmission.","output":"Ambulatory bariatric surgery: does it really lead to higher rates of adverse events?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental factors such as climate change are now underway, which have substantial impacts on health and well\\\\being of human kind, but still imprecisely quantified, implications for human health.

Climate change also triggers the occurrence of NCDs through a variety of direct and indirect pathways. Therefore, it is likely that the interdependence of climate change, environmental risk factors, and NCDs as a whole poses great threat to global health. Hence, this paper aims to review the latest evidence on impacts of environmental risk factors on NCDs and methods used in establishing the cause or correlation of environmental risk factors and NCDs. The literature review leveraged online databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar with articles that matched keywords climate change, environmental risk factors, and noncommunicable diseases. This review shows that the burden of NCDs is increasing globally and attribution of environmental risk factors such as climate change is significant. Understanding the nature of the relation between NCDs and the environment is complex and has relied on evidence generated from multiple study designs. This paper reviews eight types of study designs that can be used to identify and measure causal and correlational nature between environment and NCDs.

Moreover, in a worldwide population, periodontal disease is often associated with cardiovascular diseases. Emerging studies have reported that one of the major pathogens related to periodontitis is Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), which triggers the inflammatory intracellular cascade. Here, we hypothesized a possible protective effect of ascorbic acid (AA) in the restoration of the physiological molecular pathway after exposure to lipopolysaccharide derived from P. gingivalis (LPS-G). In particular, human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) and endothelial-differentiated hGMSCs (e-hGMSCs) exposed to LPS-G showed upregulation of p300 and downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The co-treatment of AA and LPS-G showed a physiological expression of p300 and DNMT1 in hGMSCs and e-hGMSCs. Moreover, the inflammatory process triggered by LPS-G was demonstrated by evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their intracellular localization. AA exposure re-established the physiological ROS levels. Despite the limitations of in vitro study, these findings collectively expand our knowledge regarding the molecular pathways involved in periodontal disease, and suggest the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of periodontitis.","output":"Role of ascorbic acid in the regulation of epigenetic processes induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis in endothelial-committed oral stem cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While prospect of tracking mobile devices' users is widely discussed all over European countries to counteract COVID-19 propagation, we propose a Bloom filter based construction providing users' location privacy and preventing mass surveillance.

We aimed to investigate the immediate electrophysiological characteristics following modified ablation with 3 circular and 3 linear lesions in the thoracoscopic procedure via a unilateral approach. METHODS Between May 2015 and October 2018, 40 patients underwent the one-stage hybrid procedure for LsPAF. Isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) and left atrium posterior wall (LAPW), excision of the left atrial appendage (LAA), and high-density endocardial mapping and individualized percutaneous catheter ablation for AF termination were performed. RESULTS The modified thoracoscopic procedure may enable successful PV and LAPW isolation and LAA removal. Endocardial electrophysiological examination showed 6 out of 40 (15%) patients with a right PV gap, 3 (7.5%) patients with incomplete roof lesions, and 8 (20%) patients with incomplete Dallas lesions. A total of 44 driving areas were mapped and ablated. Thirty-five patients achieved procedural AF termination. After a mean follow-up period of 26 months, the success rate of a single procedure was 85%. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the failure of procedural AF termination may be a risk factor in atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence. DISCUSSION Endocardial electrophysiological examination is a necessary partner to thoracoscopic ablation.

RPD has been increasingly adopted worldwide and in few centres is the preferred apporached approach by certain surgeons. Some large retrospective series are available and data seem to indicate that RPD is safe/feasible, and a valid alternative to the classic open Whipple. Our group has recently described a standardized 17 steps approach to RPD (Giulianotti et al. Surg Endosc 32(10): 4329-4336, 2018). Herin, we present an educational step-by-step surgical video with short technical/operative description to visually exemplify the RPD 17 steps technique. METHODS The current project has been approved by our local Institutional Review Board (IRB). We edited a step-by-step video guidance of our RPD standardized technique.

However, for wastewater data to be actionable, wastewater must be collected, concentrated, and analyzed in a timely manner. This manuscript presents modifications on a skimmed milk concentration protocol to reduce processing time, increase the number of samples that can be processed at once, and enable use in resource-limited settings. Wastewater seeded with Human coronavirus OC43 (OC43) was concentrated using a skimmed milk flocculation protocol, and then pellets were directly extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. This protocol has a higher average effective volume assayed (6.35 mL) than skimmed milk concentration methods, with and without Vertrel XF?, which involve resuspension of the pellets in PBS extraction prior to nucleic acid extraction (1.28 mL, 1.44 mL, respectively). OC43 was selected as a recovery control organism because both it and SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped respiratory viruses that primarily infect humans resulting in respiratory symptoms. The OC43 percent recovery for the direct extraction protocol (3.4%) is comparable to that of skimmed milk concentration with and without Vertrel XF? extraction (4.0%, 2.6%, respectively). When comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection using McNemars chi-square test, the pellet extraction method is not statistically different from skimmed milk concentration, with and without Vertrel XF? extraction. This suggests that the method performs equally as well as existing methods. Added benefits include reduced time spent per sample and the ability to process more samples at a single time.

While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology. The current study aimed to assess community people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh. Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh. Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs). We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV. Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats. Factor score analysis showed that respondents' gender (p = 0.01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0.03), and their occupation (p = 0.04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths.

We aimed to determine if gemcitabine-docetaxel when administered every 14-day would be as effective and less toxic compared to the 21-day schedule. Our study shows that indeed when administered in 14-day schedule gemcitabine-docetaxel chemotherapy results in similar chance of tumor shrinkage and survival yet fewer febrile neutropenia and discontinuation of chemotherapy due to intolerance, compared to 21-day schedule. Therefore, 14-day gemcitabine-docetaxel chemotherapy is safer and can be broadly adopted for the treatment of advanced soft tissue and bone sarcomas. ABSTRACT: Gemcitabine-docetaxel (G-D) combination is an effective chemotherapy for patients with advanced soft tissue and bone sarcoma, first developed with G administered on days 1 and 8, and D on day 8 every 21 days and later modified to be administered every 14 days in 2012. The 14-day regimen has become increasingly adopted. However, its efficacy and toxicities have not been compared. We identified 161 patients with metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue and bone sarcoma treated with either a 14-day or 21-day regimen within Northern California Kaiser Permanente from 1 January 2017 to 30 July 2020 and compared the outcomes and toxicity profiles of patients treated with the either regimen. Seventy-nine (49%) and 82 (51%) patients received the 14-day and the 21-day regimen, respectively, with similar response rate (22.8% and 15.8%, p = 0.26), median progression-free survival (PFS, 4.0 and 3.2 months, p = 0.15), and median overall survival (OS, 12.6 and 14.7 months, p = 0.55). Subset analysis of the untreated patients (approximately 60% of the entire cohort) as well as the patients with leiomyosarcoma only (approximately 50% of the entire cohort) showed that OS was not significantly different between the two regimens. Febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization occurred in 10 and one patients (p = 0.006) and intolerance leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy occurred in 12 and two patients (p = 0.006) treated with the 21-day and the 14-day regimens, respectively. CDKN2A deletion/mutation or CDK4 amplification was associated with worse median OS (p = 0.06), while a RB1 deletion/mutation was associated with better median PFS (p = 0.05), and these two genomic alterations were mutually exclusive. Our data demonstrate that, compared to the traditional 21-day G-D regimen, the 14-day G-D regimen is equally effective but safer. In addition, CDKN2A and RB1 pathways play significant role on the outcomes of the patients.","output":"Fourteen-Day Gemcitabine-Docetaxel Chemotherapy Is Effective and Safer Compared to 21-Day Regimen in Patients with Advanced Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has significantly disrupted medical education around the world and created the risk of students missing vital education and experience previously held within actively engaging in-person activities by switching to online leaning and teaching activities.

The Soluplus-BA micelles presented a mean size of 54.77  1.26 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.083. The MTT assay results showed that Soluplus-BA micelles increased the inhibitory effect of BA on MDA-MB-231 cells, mainly due to the enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Soluplus-BA micelles induced the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as the H2AX foci increased. Moreover, Soluplus-BA also inhibited the tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and inhibited the neovascularization of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). This angiogenesis inhibitory effect may be accomplished by regulating the HIF-1/VEGF-FAK signaling pathway.

Physical activity was studied as the primary outcome based on MET-minutes per week (metabolic equivalent). Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life based on a mental (MCS) and physical health component summary score (PCS). At the time of publication, 46/65 participants completed the study (median 52 years, 81.5% women). A significant increase of physical activity was observed in people with a low/moderate baseline activity during the first four months of follow-up (median increase by 490 MET-minutes per week, p < 0.001, r = 0.649). Both MCS (median increase by 2.8, p = 0.006, r = 0.344) and PCS (median increase by 2.6, p < 0.001, r = 0.521) significantly increased during the first two months and the BMI significantly decreased during the first six months after the intervention (median decrease by 0.96 kg/m(2), p < 0.001, r = 0.465).

GDI aims at providing a comprehensive, easy to interpret, and clinically meaningful metric of overall gait function. It has been used as an outcome measure to study gait in several conditions: cerebral palsy (CP), post-stroke hemiparetic gait, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Parkinsons disease, among others. Nevertheless, its use in population with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) has not been studied yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the applicability of the GDI to SCI through the assessment of the relationship of the GDI with the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) II. 3D gait kinematics of 34 patients with incomplete SCI (iSCI) was obtained. Besides, 3D gait kinematics of a sample of 50 healthy volunteers (HV) was also gathered with Codamotion motion capture system. A total of 302 (iSCI) and 446 (HV) strides were collected. GDI was calculated for each stride and grouped for each WISCI II level. HV data were analyzed as an additional set. Normal distribution for each group was assessed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Afterward, ANOVA tests were performed between each pair of WISCI II levels to identify differences among groups (p < 0.05). The results showed that the GDI was normally distributed across all WISCI II levels in both iSCI and HV groups. Furthermore, our results showed an increasing relationship between the GDI values and WISCI II levels in subjects with iSCI, but only discriminative in WISCI II levels 13, 19, and 20. The index successfully distinguished HV group from all the individuals with iSCI. Findings of this study indicated that the GDI is not an appropriate multivariate walking metric to represent the deviation of gait pattern in adult population with iSCI from a normal gait profile when it is compared with the levels of walking impairment described by the WISCI II. Future work should aim at defining and validating an overall gait index derived from 3D kinematic gait variables appropriate for SCI, additionally taking into account other walking ability outcome measures.","output":"Application of the Gait Deviation Index to Study Gait Impairment in Adult Population With Spinal Cord Injury: Comparison With the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 1, 2020.

However, expanded access to non-employer sponsored health coverage created by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) major coverage expansions?Medicaid expansion, in particular?may insulate some households from longer spells of being uninsured while unemployed. In this study, we explore whether net health insurance losses were larger in states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA. Study Design We apply cross-sectional differences-in-differences regressions to compare differences in health insurance coverage source and status linked to recent lob losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in states the expanded Medicaid against states that did not expand Medicaid. Population Studied 702,755 Non-elderly adults aged 19?64 in the Census Bureau?s experimental Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Our results are based on analysis of the Phase I HPS which includes adults surveyed between April 23 and July 21, 2020. Principal Findings 55% experienced a recent job loss?16% reported experiencing a job loss associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. layoff, business closed, furlough). Adults reporting COVID-related job losses were 21 percentage points (p?<?0.01) less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) at the time of their interview (relative to 78 percent among those not experiencing a job loss). People experiencing job losses were more likely to report having non-group coverage plausibly from the exchanges, although there were no differences states that did not expand Medicaid and those expanding Medicaid as of March 2020. Pandemic-linked associated enrollment in Medicaid was larger among residents of expansion states, however the association was marginally stronger among middle-income (138?400% of the Federal Poverty Limit [FPL] based on their 2019 incomes used for tax filing) households (8.3 PP, p?<?0.01) than among lower-income households with incomes under 138% FPL (6.1 PP, p?<?0.01). COVID-related job losses were negligibly associated with uninsurance among low-income adults in either expansion or non-expansion states;however, middle-income (138%?400% FPL) adults were almost 5 PP (p?<?0.01) less likely to be uninsured at the time of the interview if their state had expanded Medicaid in place relative to their counterparts in non-expansion states. Conclusions Our exploration suggests that households negatively affected by the pandemic are utilizing Medicaid to insure themselves against potential health risks they would incur while being unemployed. Although our results come from a single cross-section, we highlight that the strongest association among COVID-related job losses, Medicaid enrollment, and potential protections from long uninsured spells was concentrated among people that would be ineligible for Medicaid in 2019?just prior to the pandemic. Implications for Policy or Practice This study investigates an underexplored component of the Medicaid program is its ability to act as a safety net program for households affected by job loss. At present, 39 states expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Our findings suggest states with expanded Medicaid eligibility may allow households to partly stabilize health care needs should they become detached from private health coverage due to a job loss during the pandemic.

The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating rapidly, therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainly important from the pathogenic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 were identified from 7194 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 available from NCBI database. Effects of these mutations on structural stability, and functions of ORF3a were also studied. Broadly, three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease, and mixed (neutral and disease) types of mutations were observed. Consecutive phenomena of mutations in ORF3a protein were studied based on the timeline of detection of the mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions of the ORF3a protein, twenty clusters were detected using the K-means clustering method.

Although DS can affect many organ systems, lung and heart disease are the leading causes of death. An abundance of existing data suggests lung abnormalities originate postnatally in DS. However, a single report of branching insufficiency in DS has inferred a potential prenatal origin. The histology of T21 fetal lungs (n = 15) was assessed by an experienced pathologist. Spatial differences in cellular phenotypes were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Comprehensive gene expression in prenatal T21 lungs (n = 19), and age-matched controls (n = 19), was performed using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and validated by RT-qPCR. Histopathological abnormalities were observed in approximately half of T21 prenatal lung samples analyzed, which included dilated terminal airways/acinar tubules, dilated lymphatics, and arterial wall thickening. IHC for Ki67 revealed significant reductions in epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation, predominantly in tissues displaying pathology. IHC demonstrated that airway smooth muscle was reduced and discontinuous in the proximal airway in conjunction with reduced SOX2. RNAseq identified 118 genes significantly dysregulated (FDR <0.05) in T21 lung when unadjusted, and 316 genes when adjusted for age. Ontology analysis showed IFN pathway genes were appreciably upregulated, whereas complement and coagulation cascades and extracellular matrix pathway genes were downregulated. RT-qPCR confirmed the changes in genes associated with these pathways in prenatal T21 lungs. Our data demonstrate that specific histological, cellular, and molecular abnormalities occur prenatally in different compartments of human T21 lung, which could be representative of premature stage progression.

Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed \\"original antigenic sin.\\" The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2.

As a cause of severe necrotising pneumonia, it is associated with a high mortality rate. A rare entity, the epidemiology of PVL S. aureus (PVL-SA) pneumonia as a complication of influenza coinfection, particularly in young adults, is incompletely understood. CASE SUMMARY: An adolescent girl presented with haemoptysis and respiratory distress, deteriorated rapidly, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and profound shock requiring extensive, prolonged resuscitation, emergency critical care and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Cardiac arrest and a rare complication of ECMO cannulation necessitated intra-procedure extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, i.e., venoarterial ECMO. Coordinated infectious disease, microbiology and Public Health England engagement identified causative agents as PVL-SA and influenza A/H3N2 from bronchial aspirates within hours. Despite further complications of critical illness, the patient made an excellent recovery with normal cognitive function. The coordinated approach of numerous multidisciplinary specialists, nursing staff, infection control, specialist cardiorespiratory support, hospital services, both adult and paediatric and Public Health are testimony to what can be achieved to save life against expectation, against the odds. The case serves as a reminder of the deadly nature of PVL-SA when associated with influenza and describes a rare complication of ECMO cannulation.

In this study, the fatty acid composition (FA) of 15 commercial fish oil supplements including syrups (SYR) and capsules (CAP) from the Turkish marketplace was analyzed and some quality indices were evaluated. In addition, EPA and DHA content of FA was compared with their label claims. Fish oil supplements were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine their fatty acid composition and content. In fish oil supplements, the content of EPA ranged from 3.51% to 20.51%, and the contents of DHA ranged from 3.28% to 52.42%. The label claims for EPA presented a reasonable accuracy for products examined, but it was observed that the DHA levels of some supplements showed a considerable difference with the labels. EPA and DHA levels of fish oil capsules on the Turkish retail market were more consistent with their claimed label content compared to fish oil syrups.

METHOD: A database of all patients requiring temporary or permanent pacing in two linked cardiac centers was used to compare the number of procedures required during the first year of the pandemic compared to the corresponding period a year earlier. The database was cross\\\\referenced with a database of all patients testing positive for Sars\\\\Cov\\\\2 infection in both institutions to identify patients who required temporary or permanent pacing during COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: The number of novel pacemaker implants was lower during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic than the same period the previous year (540 vs. 629, respectively), with a similar proportion of high\\\\degree AV block (38.3% vs. 33.2%, respectively, p = .069). Four patients with the Sars\\\\Cov\\\\2 infection had a pacemaker implanted for high\\\\degree AV block, two for sinus node dysfunction. Of this cohort of six patients, two succumbed to the COVID\\\\19 illness and one from non\\\\COVID sepsis. Device interrogation demonstrated a sustained pacing requirement in all cases. CONCLUSION: High\\\\degree AV block remained unaltered in prevalence during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. There was no evidence of transient high\\\\degree AV block in patients with the Sars\\\\Cov\\\\2 infection. Our experience suggests that all clinically significant bradyarrhythmia should be treated by pacing according to usual protocols regardless of the COVID status.","output":"Prevalence of bradyarrhythmias needing pacing in COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyses the UAE leadership's approach in response to the COVID-19 crisis through the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Strategic Crisis Management Framework.

C. burnetii is transmitted to humans via aerosols and has long been considered a potential biological warfare agent. Although antibiotics, such as doxycycline, effectively treat acute Q fever, a recently identified antibiotic-resistant strain demonstrates the ability of C. burnetii to resist traditional antimicrobials, and chronic disease is extremely difficult to treat with current options. These findings highlight the need for new Q fever therapeutics, and repurposed drugs that target eukaryotic functions to prevent bacterial replication are of increasing interest in infectious disease. To identify this class of anti-C. burnetii therapeutics, we screened a library of 727 FDA-approved or late-stage clinical trial compounds using a human macrophage-like cell model of infection. Eighty-eight compounds inhibited bacterial replication, including known antibiotics, antipsychotic or antidepressant treatments, antihistamines, and several additional compounds used to treat a variety of conditions. The majority of identified anti-C. burnetii compounds target host neurotransmitter system components. Serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and adrenergic components are among the most highly represented targets and potentially regulate macrophage activation, cytokine production, and autophagy. Overall, our screen identified multiple host-directed compounds that can be pursued for potential use as anti-C. burnetii drugs. IMPORTANCECoxiella burnetii causes the debilitating disease Q fever in humans. This infection is difficult to treat with current antibiotics and can progress to long-term, potentially fatal infection in immunocompromised individuals or when treatment is delayed.

Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. METHODS: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. RESULTS: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.","output":"A novel pseudovirus-based mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to test COVID-19 interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic that hit France in the spring of 2020 sparked controversy over the triage of patients in the emergency room.

Progress in genomic characterization has made it possible to generate comprehensive profiles of genetic alterations in ccRCC; however, the correlations between recurrent somatic mutations and rapalog efficacy remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate by using multiple patient-derived ccRCC cell lines that compared to PTEN-proficient cells, PTEN-deficient cells exhibit hypersensitivity to rapalogs. Rapalogs inhibit cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 arrest without inducing apoptosis in PTEN-deficient ccRCC cell lines. Using isogenic cell lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we validate the correlation between PTEN loss and rapalog hypersensitivity. In contrast, deletion of VHL or chromatin-modifying genes (PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, or KDM5C) fails to influence the cellular response to rapalogs. Our mechanistic study shows that ectopic expression of an activating mTOR mutant (C1483F) antagonizes PTEN-induced cell growth inhibition, while introduction of a resistant mTOR mutant (A2034V) enables PTEN-deficient ccRCC cells to escape the growth inhibitory effect of rapalogs, suggesting that PTEN loss generates vulnerability to mTOR inhibition. PTEN-deficient ccRCC cells are more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of temsirolimus on cell migration and tumor growth in zebrafish and xenograft mice, respectively. Of note, PTEN protein loss as detected by immunohistochemistry is much more frequent than mutations in the PTEN gene in ccRCC patients.

The complementary learning systems (CLS) framework explains this with the small difference in familiarity strength between targets and foils. The framework, however, also predicts that familiarity values of targets and corresponding similar foils are directly comparable - as long as they are presented side by side in a forced-choice corresponding (FCC) test. This is because in each trial, targets tend to be more familiar than their corresponding foils. In contrast, when forced-choice displays contain non-corresponding foils (FCNC) which are similar to other studied items, familiarity values are not directly comparable (as in yes/no-tasks). In a recognition memory task with pictures of objects, we found that the putative ERP correlate of familiarity, the mid-frontal old/new effect for targets vs. foils, was significantly larger in FCC compared to FCNC displays. Moreover, single-trial target-foil amplitude differences predicted the accuracy of the recognition judgment. This study supports the assumption of the CLS framework that the test format can influence the diagnostic reliability of familiarity. Moreover, it implies that the mid-frontal old/new effect does not reflect the difference in the familiarity signal between studied and non-studied items but the task-adequate assessment of this signal.","output":"Usefulness of familiarity signals during recognition depends on test format: Neurocognitive evidence for a core assumption of the CLS framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities across the globe, the need to contain the spread of the outbreaks is of paramount importance.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of COVID-19 patients followed-up in the ICU of our institution between 01.04.2020 and 01.10.2021. Patients were classified into two groups according to mortality status as survivors and non-survivors. Various inflammatory parameters of the groups were compared and their efficacy in predicting mortality was investigated. RESULTS: Out of 348 study patients, 86 cases (24.7%) were in the survived group and 262 cases (75.3%) were in the dead group. The median age of the mortal group was significantly higher than that of the survived group (65.5 vs 76, P < .001).

In comparison with adults, children present milder symptoms, with most having an asymptomatic course. We hypothesized that COVID-19 infection has a negative impact on the continuation of chemotherapy and increases nonrelapse mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed to assess the course of SARS-CoV-2 among children with hematological or oncological malignancies and its impact on cancer therapy. Records of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 155 children with malignancies from 14 Polish centers for pediatric hematology and oncology were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 replication was observed in 155 patients. Forty-nine patients were symptomatic, with the following being the most common manifestations: fever (31 patients), gastrointestinal symptoms (10), coryza (13), cough (13) and headache (8). In children who were retested, the median time of a positive PCR result was 16 days (range 1C70 days), but 12.7% of patients were positive beyond day + 20. The length of viral PCR positivity correlated with the absolute neutrophil count at diagnosis. Seventy-six patients did not undergo further SARS-CoV-2 testing and were considered convalescents after completion of isolation. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 15 children, remdesivir in 6, convalescent plasma in 4, oxygen therapy in 3 (1mechanical ventilation), steroids in 2, intravenous immunoglobulins in 2, and heparin in 4. Eighty patients were treated with chemotherapy within 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis or were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during 30 days of chemotherapy administration. Respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 and associated with oxygen therapy were present in 4 patients in the study population, and four deaths were recorded (2 due to COVID-19 and 2 due to progressive malignancy). The probability of 100-day overall survival was 97.3% (95% CI 92.9C99%). Delay in the next chemotherapy cycle occurred in 91 of 156 cases, with a median of 14 days (range 2C105 days).

The infection rate (positive cases per million of the population) and the test positivity rate (positive cases among the total number of conducted diagnostic tests) of each day during this period were calculated both for the Mymensingh region and national level. Both the test positivity rate (TPR) and infection rates in the Mymensingh region demonstrated an increasing trend. The mean test positivity rate of the Mymensingh region on the week before the festival was 9.5%. It increased to a mean test positivity rate of 13% in the following week and further rose to a rate of 17% in the next week.

This study is aimed at describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Methods: 199 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in China from January 24th to March 15th. The cases were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups according to the history of taking antidiabetic drugs or by plasma fasting blood glucose level at admission, and the difference between groups were compared. Results: Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO2), and higher mortality (P < 0.05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6  109/L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death. Antidiabetic drugs were associated with decreasing odds of death. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was not related to odds of death.

The primary aim was to determine the mortality risk and associated variables when operating on urgent cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objective was to assess differences in the outcome of patients treated between sites treating COVID-19 and a separate surgical site. METHODS: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Secondary measures included complications of surgery, COVID-19 infection, and length of stay. Multiple variables were assessed for their contribution to the 30-day mortality. In total, 433 patients were included with a mean age of 65 years; 45% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 7.6% for all patients and 15.9% for femoral neck fractures. The mortality rate increased from 7.5% to 44.2% in patients with fracture neck of femur and a COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 rate in the 30-day postoperative period was 11%.

METHODS: Data from two French birth cohortsELFE and EPIPAGE-2were used. In 2011, infants born 22 weeks gestation were recruited. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when the children were 9 years old and experiencing school closure. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Subjects included 4164 full-term and 1119 preterm children. In univariate analyses, compared to full-term children: extremely and very preterm children more frequently had abnormal and borderline ADHD scores (odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50C2.30, OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08C1.85, respectively) and abnormal emotional scores (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.43C2.40); moderate to late preterm children more often had abnormal ADHD scores (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01C1.78).

The study cohort comprised 86 consecutively treated patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN, N = 59) or robotic-assisted (RPN, N = 27) partial nephrectomy by a single surgeon. RESULTS There was no difference between the LPN and RPN cohort in terms of gender, age, operative side, American Society of Anesthesiology score, or preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). An early unclamping technique was used for 22 (82%) patients in the RPN cohort and 6 (10%) patients in the LPN cohort. (P < 0.001). Warm ischemia time was lower in the RPN cohort (mean 18.5 vs. 28.0 min, P = <0.001) as result of majority undergoing early unclamping. There was no difference in operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, transfusion rate, positive surgical margin, or postoperative decrease in eGFR. There was no difference in mean eGFR decrease after early unclamping (16%) versus traditional clamping (22%); however, 11 (29%) patients had greater than 50% decrease in eGFR after traditional clamping versus 0 patients after early unclamping (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing RPN during implementation of a robotic kidney surgery program when compared with LPN appear to have equivalent perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy.

SOURCES: We performed a series of PubMed searches between January 1, 2020 to January 12, 2022. CONTENT: Migrant workers in high-income countries often work in high-risk occupations for COVID-19 transmission, contract COVID-19 at higher rates and experience worse outcomes than native-born counterparts. For example, meat processing plants represent almost ideal environments for rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission, as often large migrant workforces confined to small workspaces perform physically demanding work in noisy environments, that require shouting to communicate, and increase workers respiratory rates and quantity of aerosolized droplets expelled C thus increasing viral transmission risk.

To date, the biosynthetic genes for prenyl-flavonoid glycosides still remain elusive in Epimedium. Here, we identified five genes in Epimedium wushanense responsible for the biosynthesis of naringenin, the common precursor for flavonoid natural products. We successfully set up the biosynthetic pathway of naringenin using l-tyrosine as the precursor through enzymatic assays of these genes' encoding products, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EwPAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (Ew4CL1), chalcone synthase (EwCHS1), chalcone isomerase (EwCHI1) and CHI-like protein (EwCHIL3). Intriguingly, in vitro characterisation of the above catalytic enzymes' substrate specificity indicated a route parallel to naringenin biosynthesis, which starts from l-phenylalanine and ends in pinocembrin. The fact that there is no pinocembrin or pinocembrin-derived flavonoid accumulated in E. wushanense prompted us to propose that pinocembrin is likely converted into naringenin in vivo, constituting two parallel biosynthetic pathways for naringenin.

Methods: Using a Bayesian meta-regression of 40 studies measuring the impact of mask use on respiratory viral infections, we estimated the reduction in transmission associated with the use of cloth or paper masks used in a general population setting. We used data from daily surveys conducted by Facebook, YouGov, and Premise, on the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask outside their home for nearly all countries. We predicted deaths and infections until January 1st 2021 under a reference and universal mask use scenario using a deterministic transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR). In the reference scenario, we assume continued easing of mandates but with action to re-impose mandates for a period of six weeks, at a level of eight daily deaths per million population. The universal mask scenario assumed scaling up of mask use to 95% over a one-week period. Findings: Use of simple masks can reduce transmission of COVID19 by 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 20% to 54%). Universal mask use would lead to a reduction of 815,600 deaths (95% UI 430,600 to 1,491,000 deaths) between August 26th 2020 and January 1st 2021, the difference between the predicted 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) in the reference and 2.18 million deaths (95% UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) in the universal mask scenario over this time period. Mask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to 79.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The effect of universal mask use is greatest in countries such as India (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United States of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer deaths; 95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths). Interpretation: The rising toll of the COVID19 pandemic can be substantially reduced by the universal adoption of masks. This low-cost policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits and likely large economic benefits as well, by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing mandates.","output":"Global projections of potential lives saved from COVID-19 through universal mask use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing in patients with altered olfactory/gustatory function due to COVID-19 for evidence of viral neuroinvasion. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase to identify publications that described at least one patient with COVID-19 who had altered olfactory/gustatory function and had CSF testing performed. The search ranged from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. RESULTS: We identified 51 publications that described 70 patients who met inclusion criteria. Of 51 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, 3 (6%) patients had positive results and 1 (2%) patient had indeterminate results. Cycle threshold (Ct; the number of amplification cycles required for the target gene to exceed the threshold, which is inversely related to viral load) was not provided for the patients with a positive PCR. The patient with indeterminate results had a Ct of 37 initially, then no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeat testing. Of 6 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, 3 (50%) were positive. Testing to distinguish intrathecal antibody synthesis from transudation of antibodies to the CSF via breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was performed in 1/3 (33%) patients; this demonstrated antibody transmission to the CSF via transudation. CONCLUSION: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare in patients with altered olfactory/gustatory function. While pathology studies are needed, our review suggests it is unlikely that these symptoms are related to viral neuroinvasion.","output":"Cerebrospinal fluid from COVID-19 patients with olfactory/gustatory dysfunction: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom included large scale changes to healthcare delivery, without fully understanding the potential for unexpected effects caused by these changes. The aim was to ascertain the characteristics of patients, uncertainty over diagnosis, or features of the emergency response to the pandemic that could be modified to mitigate against future excess deaths. METHODS: Review of the entire pathway of care of patients whose death was registered in Salford during the 8 week period of the first wave (primary care, secondary care, 111 and 999 calls) in order to create a single record of healthcare prior to death. An expert panel judged avoidability of death against the National Mortality Case Record Review Programme scale. The panel identified themes using a structured judgement review format. RESULTS: There were 522 deaths including 197 in hospital, and 190 in care homes. 51% of patients were female, 81% Caucasian, age 79  9 years. Dementia was present in 35%, COVID-19 was cause of death in 44%. Healthcare contact prior to death was most frequently with primary care (81% of patients). Forty-six patients (9%) had healthcare appointments cancelled (median 1 cancellation, range 1C9). Fewer than half of NHS 111 calls were answered during this period. 18% of deaths contained themes consistent with some degree of avoidability. In people aged 75 years who lived at home this was 53%, in care home residents 29% and in patients with learning disability 44% (n = 9). Common themes were; delays in patients presenting to care providers (10%), delays in testing (17%), avoidable exposure to COVID-19 (26%), delays in provider response (5%), and sub-optimal care (11%). For avoidability scores of 2 or 3 (indicating more than 50% chance of avoidability), 44% of cases had > 2 themes. CONCLUSIONS: The initial emergency response had unforeseen consequences resulting in late presentation, sub-optimal assessments, and delays in receiving care. Death in more vulnerable groups was more likely to display avoidability themes.

METHODS The influences of noni juice on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and the activity of AKT/nuclear factor-  B (NF-  B) signaling pathway in A549 human lung cancer cells were detected by MTT, cell counting kit-8, colony formation, Annexin V/PI double labeling, transwell, scratch test and immunoblotting assay, respectively. A549 cells were inoculated into the right axilla of nude mice, followed by noni juice treatment. The body weight of the nude mice was weighed, and the tumor volume and weight were measured. Cell proliferation and expression of apoptosis-related proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry, and the activity of NF-  B signaling pathway was measured by immunoblotting. RESULTS The in vitro studies showed that noni juice inhibited the A549 cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Noni juice also promoted cells apoptosis in A549 cells. Immunoblotting assay showed that the phosphorylation level of AKT, p50, and STAT3 proteins was inhibited to different extents after noni juice treatment. The in vivo studies showed that noni juice effectively suppressed tumor formation of A549 cells in nude mice. Noni juice treatment inhibited the expression of Ki67, PCNA, and Bcl-2 protein in the tumor; while promoted the expression of caspase-3 protein. Additionally, we also found that noni juice treatment could restrain the activity of AKT/NF-  B signaling pathway in the tumor tissue.

This study tested the hypothesis that this eosinopenia is COVID-19 specific and is associated with systemic activation of eosinophils.. Methods: Blood of 15 healthy controls and 75 adult patients with suspected COVID-19 at the ER were included before PCR testing and analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry (CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L) in the absence or presence of a formyl peptide (fNLF). 45 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were grouped based on disease severity. PCR negative patients with proven bacterial (n=20) or other viral (n=10) infections were used as disease controls. Eosinophils were identified with the use of the FlowSom algorithm. Results: Low blood eosinophil numbers (<100 cells/microL;p<0.005) were found both in patients with COVID-19 and with other infectious diseases albeit less pronounced. Two discrete eosinophil populations were identified in healthy controls both before and after activation with fNLF based on the expression of CD11b. Before activation, the CD11bbright population consisted of 5.4% (CI95% = 3.8, 13.4) of total eosinophils. After activation, this population of CD11bbright cells comprised nearly half the population (42.21%, CI95% = 35.9, 54.1). Eosinophils in COVID-19 had a similar percentage of CD11bbright cells before activation (7.6%, CI95% = 4.5, 13.6), but were clearly refractory to activation with fNLF as a much lower percentage of cells end up in the CD11bbright fraction after activation (23.7%, CI95% = 18.5, 27.6;p<0.001). Conclusion: Low eosinophil numbers in COVID-19 are associated with refractoriness in responsiveness to fNLF, which is likely caused by migration of fully functional cells to the tissue. Such homing might be beneficial as eosinophils have been implicated in viral killing.","output":"The Systemic Immune Response in COVID-19 is Associated with a Shift to Formyl-Peptide Unresponsive Eosinophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence, characteristics and preventive status of skin injuries caused by personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical staff. APPROACH A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting against COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cellphone. The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injuries types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures. Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were employed to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. RESULTS A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid. The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% CI 41.30%-44.30%) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist associated skin damage and skin tear. Co-skin injuries and multiple locations injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95%CI for OR 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13) and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria for this study were studies published in English or Scandinavian language and scientific original research that included randomised or non-randomised prospective controlled studies. Additionally, studies that reported the outcomes from a PAC consultation with the patient present were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by a team of three authors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies. Data extraction was performed by one author and checked by four other authors. Results were synthesised narratively owing to the heterogeneity of the included studies. RESULTS: Seven prospective controlled studies on the effectiveness of PACs were included.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Twenty-seven academic and community ICUs in the United States and South Korea. SUBJECTS: Site leaders. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to March 2020, all sites had participated in 6 months of webinars, monthly calls, and listserv communication to facilitate projects and to collect preimplementation family satisfaction and clinician perception data. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Planned projects included ICU orientation initiatives (12, 44.4%), structured family care conferences (6, 22.2%), and ICU diaries (5, 18.5%). After cancelation of the collaborative, 22 site leaders (81.5%) were surveyed by phone from June 2020 to July 2020. Twenty (90.1%) reported having stopped their site project; projects that continued were 1) a standardized palliative extubation protocol and 2) daily written clinical summaries for families. Sites described significant variability in visitor restriction policies and uncertainty regarding future policy changes. Four sites (18.2%) reported that their hospital did not provide personal protective equipment to visitors. Regarding video conferencing with families, 11 sites (52.4%) reported clinicians using their own personal devices. Two-hundred twelve family surveys and 346 clinician surveys collected prior to cancelation highlighted a broad need for family support. When leaders were asked on a scale from 0 to 10 how helpful collaborative activities had been prior to cancelation, mean response was 8.0 (sd 2.5).

At the outset of these dual public health emergencies, the BC government announced interim Risk Mitigation Guidance (RMG) that permitted prescribing medication alternatives to substances, including opioids, alcohol, stimulants and benzodiazepines, an intervention sometimes referred to as 'safe supply'. This protocol outlines the approach for a study of the implementation of RMG and its impacts on COVID-19 infection, drug-related and systemic harms, continuity of care for people with substance use disorder (SUD), as well as their behavioural, psychosocial and well-being outcomes.

METHODS: We identified Senegal as an exemplar in the delivery of childhood vaccines through analysis of DTP1 and DTP3 coverage data. Through interviews and focus group discussions at the national, regional, district, health facility, and community-level, we investigated factors that contributed to high and sustained vaccination coverage. We conducted a thematic analysis through application of implementation science frameworks to determine critical success factors. We triangulated these findings with quantitative analyses using publicly available data. RESULTS: The following success factors emerged: 1) Strong political will and prioritization of resources for immunization programming supported urgent allocation of funding and supplies; 2) Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Social Action and external partners fostered innovation, capacity building, and efficiency; 3) Improved surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation allowed for timely and evidence-based decision making; 4) Community ownership of vaccine service delivery supported tailored programming and quick response to local needs; and 5) Community health workers spearheaded vaccine promotion and demand generation for vaccines. CONCLUSION: The vaccination program in Senegal was supported by evidence-based decision making at the national-level, alignment of priorities between governmental entities and external partners, and strong community engagement initiatives that fostered local ownership of vaccine delivery and uptake. High routine immunization coverage was likely driven by prioritization of immunization programming, improved surveillance systems, a mature and reliable community health worker program, and tailored strategies for addressing geographical, social, and cultural barriers.","output":"Critical success factors for high routine immunization performance: A case study of Senegal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The link between hand and surface hygiene and the spread of disease has been reported by various studies and understanding the appropriate use of hand hygiene is important in healthcare. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the My Five Moments for Hand Hygiene model to educate healthcare workers about the importance of hand hygiene to stop the spread of disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper were to determine if the WHO Hand Hygiene Observation Form could be used to monitor for hand and personal hygiene practices of Optometry students, and what their actual hygiene practices are in an Optometry training facility in South Africa. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at an Optometry training facility in South Africa using third (n=32) and fourth year (n=39) students. The Hand Hygiene Knowledge Questionnaire for Health Care Workers by the WHO was used to determine their knowledge regarding hand hygiene. After completing the questionnaire, participants were observed in the clinic while consulting patients to determine the hand and surface hygiene practices they apply. RESULTS: The WHO hand hygiene observation rubric was not appropriate to evaluate hand and surface hygiene in Optometry facilities. The adapted observation rubric created was a better tool to evaluate student hygiene practices and was able to record which hand or surface hygiene were missed when presented with such opportunities. Although 90.1% of the students knew that germs could be transferred to the patients via hands, only 46.5% routinely used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. CONCLUSION: This observation rubric developed during this study can assist in creating awareness with students about their own hand and surface hygiene deficiencies when interacting with patients.","output":"Adaptation of the WHO Hand Hygiene Observation Form for Application in Optometry Training Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antigen-based tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are inexpensive and can return results within 15 minutes (1). Antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in asymptomatic and symptomatic persons within the first 5-12 days after symptom onset (2). These tests have been used at U.S. colleges and universities and other congregate settings (e.g., nursing homes and correctional and detention facilities), where serial testing of asymptomatic persons might facilitate early case identification (3-5). However, test performance data from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons are limited. This investigation evaluated performance of the Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) compared with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 detection among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons at two universities in Wisconsin. During September 28-October 9, a total of 1,098 paired nasal swabs were tested using the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA and real-time RT-PCR. Virus culture was attempted on all antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens. Among 871 (79%) paired swabs from asymptomatic participants, the antigen test sensitivity was 41.2%, specificity was 98.4%, and in this population the estimated positive predictive value (PPV) was 33.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.8%. Antigen test performance was improved among 227 (21%) paired swabs from participants who reported one or more symptoms at specimen collection (sensitivity = 80.0%; specificity = 98.9%; PPV = 94.1%; NPV = 95.9%). Virus was isolated from 34 (46.6%) of 73 antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive nasal swab specimens, including two of 18 that were antigen-negative and real-time RT-PCR-positive (false-negatives). The advantages of antigen tests such as low cost and rapid turnaround might allow for rapid identification of infectious persons. However, these advantages need to be balanced against lower sensitivity and lower PPV, especially among asymptomatic persons. Confirmatory testing with an FDA-authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), such as RT-PCR, should be considered after negative antigen test results in symptomatic persons, and after positive antigen test results in asymptomatic persons (1).","output":"Performance of an Antigen-Based Test for Asymptomatic and Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Testing at Two University Campuses - Wisconsin, September-October 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid droplets are lipid-rich cytosolic organelles that play roles in cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and many other cellular activities. Recent studies revealed that lipid droplets in cancer cells have various biological functions, such as energy production, membrane synthesis, and chemoresistance, thereby fostering cancer progression. Accordingly, the administration of antilipemic agents could improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy given hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs could be encapsulated into lipid droplets and then expelled to extracellular space. In this study, we investigated whether statins could promote treatment efficacy of lipid droplet-rich ovarian SKOV-3 cells and the potential influences on generation and composition of cell-derived extracellular vesicles and particles (EVP). Our studies indicate that statins can significantly lower lipid biosynthesis. Moreover, statins can inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of SKOV-3 cells and enhance chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, statins can lower EVP secretion but enforce the release of cholesterol-enriched EVPs, which can further lower lipid contents in parental cells. It is the first time that the influence of statins on EVP generation and EVP-lipid composition is observed. Overall, we demonstrated that statins could inhibit lipid production, expel cholesterol to extracellular space via EVPs, and improve chemosensitivity.","output":"Statins Lower Lipid Synthesis But Promote Secretion of Cholesterol-Enriched Extracellular Vesicles and Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mortality of 20% of a flock of 1000 chukar partridge chicks occurred over a 6-week period in Northern California from August to September 2012.

Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two public hospitals, Omdurman maternity and AL-Saudi hospitals in Omdurman, Khartoum state, from February to April 2020. Results: We interviewed 350 pregnant women in the two hospitals. Our findings showed that one-third of pregnant women (35.7%) searched for information about vaccines. The vast majority searched for this information before pregnancy and during pregnancy (34.4 and 59.2%, respectively). They primarily searched for topics related to vaccine schedules and vaccine side effects (28.8% for each). The main sources of vaccine-related information consumed by pregnant women were healthcare professionals, particularly doctors (40%), and the internet (20.8%). Findings showed that a high level of education was associated with a greater likelihood of searching for additional vaccine information. Moreover, those who perceived their family to have a high income were more likely to search for information. Additionally, pregnant women with low confidence in vaccines were more likely to be involved in searching for additional vaccine information. This highlights the need for high-quality, easily accessible information that addresses their needs. Conclusion: Our findings showed that confidence in vaccine influences seeking for relevant information.

These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of non-synonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerate sites toward uracil residues is seen in ORF1ab of all the studied coronaviruses: both in the ORF1a and in the ORF1b translated thanks to the programmed ribosomal frameshifting that has an efficiency of 14 C 45% in different species. A more substantial mutational U-pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b perhaps because ORF1a is translated more frequently than ORF1b. Mutational U-pressure is there even in ORFs that are not translated from genomic RNA plus strands, but the bias is weaker than in ORF1ab. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U-pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring during the RNA plus strand replication and also translation, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the mutational U-pressure that becomes stronger during translation of viral RNA plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analog development for treating COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","output":"Translation-Associated Mutational U-Pressure in the First ORF of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shift to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a need to develop technologies, resources, and strategies for teaching elementary grade learners online This study uses online teacher inquiry as a form of practice-based knowledge production to identify and develop instructional practices and support structures for online teaching in grades PK-5 Six teachers of PK-5 classrooms in the United States participated in a teacher inquiry program as they transitioned from in-person to online teaching Findings provide guidance to assist teachers and administrators in designing teaching and structures that support online learning in the elementary grades ? 2021 ISTE","output":"PK-5 teacher perspectives on the design of remote teaching: pedagogies and support structures to sustain student learning online"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animals presenting with brachycephalic syndrome suffer from multilevel obstruction of the airways as well as secondary structural collapse.

This study aims to explore the new demand and opportunities for innovation in public health competencies, which were caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Methods We draw on secondary sources and critically review the public health competency framework recently launched by WHO and ASPHER through the lens of COVID-19. Results The WHO-ASPHER Competency Framework for Public Health Workforce illustrates an interdisciplinary, inter-professional and lifelong learning approach to public health. Five critical competency areas can be identified in relation to global public health emergencies: (1) flexibility, adaptation, motivation, communication, (2) research, analytical sensitivity, ethics, diversity, (3) epidemiology, (4) preparedness and (5) employability. However, this may not be enough. New models of public health leadership and changes in the health workforce are needed, which transform the silos of professions and policy. Such transformations would include learning, working, leading and governing differently and must stretch far beyond the public health workforce. Innovating public health competences stretches far beyond individual competence development. Moreover, it is about resilience and preparedness and calls for learning, working, leading and governing differently. Critical public health competences are not limited to the public heath workforce, but must become relevant for all healthcare professions. Conclusions To achieve transformative capacity, critical public health competences must be considered for all healthcare workers on all levels of policymaking, thus becoming the heart' of health workforce resilience and pandemic preparedness.

Much of this heterogeneity may be related to the genetic variation in different individuals/populations that alters their capacity to synthesize biologically active n-3 and omega 6 (n-6) PUFAs and metabolites from their 18 carbon dietary precursors, linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3, n-3). Here, we discuss the role of a FADS gene-by-dietary PUFA interaction model that takes into consideration dietary exposure, including the intake of LA and ALA, n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in determining the efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation.

This study aimed to quantitatively synthesise available evidence on the association between QoL and mortality in the general population. METHODS An electronic search was conducted using three bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were studies that assessed QoL using standardized tools and examined mortality risk in a non-patient population. Qualitative data synthesis and meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed. RESULTS Of 4184 articles identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion, involving approximately 1,200,000 participants. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of QoL measures, population characteristics and data analysis. In total, 43 studies (91.5%) reported that better QoL was associated with lower mortality risk. The results of four meta-analyses indicated that higher health-related QoL (HRQoL) is associated with lower mortality risk, which was consistent for overall HRQoL (HR 0.633, 95% CI: 0.514 to 0.780), physical function (HR 0.987, 95% CI: 0.982 to 0.992), physical component score (OR 0.950, 95% CI: 0.935 to 0.965), and mental component score (OR 0.980, 95% CI: 0.969 to 0.992).

To overcome this, unsupervised network analyses are used to identify clusters of genes that can be associated with distinct molecular mechanisms and outcomes for a disease. In this study, we developed an integrated network analysis framework that integrates transcriptional signatures from multiple model systems with protein-protein interaction data to find gene modules. Through a meta-analysis of different enriched features from these gene modules, we extract communities of highly interconnected features. These clusters of higher-order features, working as a multifeatured machine, enable collective assessment of their contribution for disease or phenotype characterization. We show the utility of this workflow using transcriptomics data from three different models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","output":"Secondary analysis of transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection models to characterize COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prehospital telephone triage stratifies patients into five categories, need immediate hospital visit by ambulance, need to visit a hospital within 1 hour, need to visit a hospital within 6 hours, need to visit a hospital within 24 hours, and do not need a hospital visit in Japan. However, studies on whether present and past histories cause undertriage are limited in patients triaged as need an early hospital visit. We investigated factors associated with undertriage by comparing patient assessed to be appropriately triaged with those assessed undertriaged. METHODS: We included all patients classified by telephone triage as need to visit a hospital within 1 h and 6 h who used a single after-hours house call (AHHC) medical service in Tokyo, Japan, between November 1, 2019, and November 31, 2020. After home consultation, AHHC doctors classified patients as grade 1 (treatable with over-the-counter medications), 2 (requires hospital or clinic visit), or 3 (requires ambulance transportation). Patients classified as grade 2 and 3 were defined as appropriately triaged and undertriaged, respectively. RESULTS: We identified 10,742 eligible patients triaged as need to visit a hospital within 1 h and 6 h, including 10,479 (97.6%) appropriately triaged and 263 (2.4%) undertriaged patients.

The purpose of the approach is to classify simple actions by applying shape descriptors to sequences of binary silhouettes. The recognition process consists of several main stages: shape representation, action sequence representation and action sequence classification. Firstly, each shape is represented using a selected shape descriptor. Secondly, shape descriptors of each sequence are matched, matching values are put into a vector and transformed into final action representationwe employ Fourier transform-based methods to obtain action representations equal in size. A classification into eight classes is performed using leave-one-out cross-validation and template matching approaches. We present results of the experiments on classification accuracy using moment-based shape descriptors (Zernike Moments, Moment Invariants and Contour Sequence Moments) and three matching measures (Euclidean distance, correlation coefficient and C1 correlation). Different combinations of the above-mentioned algorithms are examined in order to indicate the most effective one. The experiments show that satisfactory results are obtained when low-order Zernike Moments are used for shape representation and absolute values of Fourier transform are applied to represent action sequences.

Many patients are required to travel long distances to access specialist care. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a number of rapid changes into the care for patients with cancer, with increasing utilization of telemedicine. We aimed to evaluate how the utilization of telemedicine affects professionals and patients across Scotland and care delivery, at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre Sarcoma Unit. METHODS: Between June 8 and August 25, 2020, we invited patients and professional sarcoma multidisciplinary team members to participate in separate online anonymous survey questionnaires, to assess their attitudes toward telemedicine. Data were extracted, and descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction (n = 64) with telemedicine was high (mean = 9.4/10) and comparable with traditional face-to-face appointments (mean = 9.5/10). Patients were receptive to the use of telemedicine in certain situations, with patients strongly opposed to being told bad news via telemedicine (88%). Providers recommended the use of telemedicine in certain patient populations and reported largely equivalent workloads when compared with traditional consultations. Providers reported that telemedicine should be integrated into regular practice (66%), with patients echoing this indicating a preference for a majority of telemedicine appointments (57%). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in sarcoma care is favorable from both clinician and patient perspectives. Utilization of telemedicine for patients with rare cancers such as sarcomas is an innovative approach to the delivery of care, especially considering the time and financial pressures on patients who often live a distance away from specialist centers.

These high-demand positions often coupled with few organizational or supervisory supports contribute to decreased worker well-being and low retention. Informed by the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined common demand-resource sub-groups among recently-hired child welfare workers and how sub-group membership contributed to agency retention. This study used data from the Florida Study of Professionals for Safe Families (FSPSF), a four-year, longitudinal cohort study of child welfare workers hired in 2015C16 (n = 912). We used a three-step Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) with logistic regression to identify profiles of workers based on demand and support levels at 6 months to predict agency retention 12 months later. Findings resulted in five profiles: floundering, surviving through supervisor, surviving through role, surviving through supports, and thriving. Profile distributions indicated both demands and supports were independently important for retention. Each profile had higher odds of staying at the agency compared to the floundering profile, those floundering in role and support (ORs = 2.08C7.68). Those in the thriving profile, thriving in role and support, had higher odds of staying when compared to each other profile (ORs = 2.12C7.68). Findings identify that demands and supports operate in an additive way to promote retention and suggest that agencies can address individual aspects of workers role and support challenges to improve retention without requiring a single approach to combat workload and environment simultaneously.","output":"The Importance of Job Demands and Supports: Promoting Retention Among Child Welfare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine enhance antibody responses to variants in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endometriosis occurs in approximately 10% of adult women worldwide; however, it is commonly under- or misdiagnosed in adolescents.

Self-reflection encourages students to think deeply about their learning experiences and benefit both learners and instructors. This system has the potential to allow reflections also to help future learners. By demonstrating that previous students encountered and overcame similar challenges, we could help improve students' sense of belonging.

However, the existing systems are run by the people&#x2019;s smartphones and without a strong participation from the people, the systems become ineffective. Moreover, these systems can be misused to spy on people and breach their privacy. Due to recent privacy breaches, people became anxious about their privacy, and without privacy reassurance, the people may not accept the systems. In this paper, we propose a non-participatory privacy-preserving surveillance system for COVID-19-like pandemics. The system aims to control the spread of COVID-19 infection without depending on the participation of the people and with privacy preservation. In the proposed system, surveillance cameras of public places take images of visitors and compute embedding vectors that encode the facial features of the images by using deep learning techniques. A searchable encryption scheme is used by public places to encrypt the embedding vectors and send them to a cloud server (service manager). Similarly, hospitals and test centers send the encryptions of the embedding vectors of the images of positively-tested people to the cloud server. Finally, the server does operations on encrypted data to learn whether an infected person visited a public place for contact tracing without being able to learn the images or identify the visitors of the places and the infected persons, and then it alerts these places to take precautionary measures.

Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Different populations react differently to the disease, making it very hard to track the spread of the infection in a population. Measuring specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an important tool to assess the spread of the infection or successful vaccinations. To achieve sufficient sample numbers, alternatives to venous blood sampling are needed not requiring medical personnel or cold-chains. Dried-blood-spots (DBS) on filter-cards have been used for different studies, but not routinely for serology. METHODS: We developed a semi-automated protocol using self-sampled DBS for SARS-CoV-2 serology. It was validated in a cohort of matched DBS and venous-blood samples (n = 1710). Feasibility is demonstrated with two large serosurveys with 10247 company employees and a population cohort of 4465 participants. FINDINGS: Sensitivity and specificity reached 9920% and 9865%, respectively. Providing written instructions and video tutorials, 9987% (4465/4471) of the unsupervised home sampling DBS cards could be analysed.

METHODS: Systemic literature searches were performed using PubMed, Embase, Alzgene and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Relevant data were abstracted according to predefined criteria. RESULTS: Totally, 82 independent cohorts from 65 studies were included, focusing on five candidate polymorphisms. For rs1799752 polymorphism, in overall analyses, the insertion (I) allele conferred increased risk to AD compared to the deletion (D) allele (I vs. D: OR = 1.091, 95% CI = 1.007C1.181, p = 0.032); while the I carriers showed increased AD susceptibility compared with the D homozygotes (II + ID vs. : OR = 1.131, 95% CI = 1.008C1.270, p = 0.036). However, none of the positive results passed FDR adjustment.

Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the UK variant, in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD).

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mucormycosis (IM) are two of the most common mold infections. A better understanding of patient comorbidities and risk factors that predispose IMI may help clinicians to refine the difficult diagnostic and treatment process. METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted (January 2008COctober 2019) for studies reporting comorbidities/risk factors of patients with IA or IM (Phase I), followed by an analysis on the Optum(?) US EHR database of prominent risk factor cohorts based on SLR findings and expert opinion (Phase II). From the four identified patient cohorts: 1) patients undergoing solid organ transplant (SOT) and patients with 2) hematologic cancers, 3) diabetes, or 4) lung disease, rates of IA, IM, or concurrent IA and IM; patient comorbidities; and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were reported. RESULTS: The SLR included 88 studies, and 46 were used to select comorbidities/risk factors cohorts in IA and IM patients. The most important comorbidities/risk factors in IA and IM patients were diabetes, lung disease, hematological malignances, and SOT. In the Optum database (N=101,340,454 patients), IA rates were highest in lung transplant (10.81%) patients and IM rates were highest in intestine transplant (0.83%) patients, lung transplant (0.43%), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (0.49%). CCI scores were elevated in all mold infection groups compared to the total Optum cohort. CONCLUSION: The current study describes patient comorbidity and risk factors associated with IA and IM. These data can be used to refine clinical decision-making regarding when to suspect mold infections. Future research should focus on identifying whether patients respond differently to various antifungal treatments to determine if strategic recommendations should be made for certain patient groups.","output":"Patient Characteristics and Risk Factors in Invasive Mold Infections: Comparison from a Systematic Review and Database Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Federal, provincial and municipal leaders in Canada have adopted a culture of preparedness with the development and update of emergency plans in anticipation of different types of disasters. As evident during the 2003 global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it is important to provide support for health care workers (HCWs) who are vulnerable during infectious outbreak scenarios. Here we focus on the identification and evaluation of existing support mechanisms incorporated within emergency plans across various jurisdictional levels. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of 12 emergency plans from national, provincial and municipal levels were conducted using NVIVOTM software. The plans were scanned and coded according to 1) informational, 2) instrumental, and 3) emotional support mechanisms for HCWs and other first responders. RESULTS: Emergency plans were comprised of a predominance of informational and instrumental supports, yet few emotional or social support mechanisms. All the plans lacked gender-based analysis of how infectious disease outbreaks impact male and female HCWs differently. Acknowledgement of the need for emotional supports was evident at higher jurisdictional levels, but recommended for implementation locally. CONCLUSIONS: While support mechanisms for HCWs are included in this sample of emergency plans, content analysis revealed few emotional or social supports planned for critical personnel; particularly for those who will be required to work in extremely stressful conditions under significant personal risk.

Methods- The study was conducted during 3rd week of January 2021. Among 3550 HCWs, 979 subjects were selected by stratified random sampling and grouped into high risk and low risk category based on job setting. Demographic details and clinical information regarding previous history of COVID 19 were collected at the time of SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. Results: From 979 subjects, the data with respect to 940 health care workers were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 19.1% of HCWs. Seroprevalence among high risk group was 20.3% and that in low risk group was 7.4% [p=0.005]. In high-risk group, seropositivity was noted in 30.54 % of nurses, 19% hospital attenders, 18.9% resident doctors and 6.4% consultant doctors. In those with past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity was 75.4%. In those who were COVID positive during July2020, 33.3% were still IgG reactive.

FDG PET/CT has been shown to play an important role for the diagnosis of PVE as a major Duke criterion. Whether FDG PET/CT could play a similar role in patients with suspected native valve endocarditis (NVE) is less well established. It is increasingly recognized that IE is a multisystem disorder, and identification of extra-cardiac manifestations on whole-body FDG PET/CT impacts management and prognosis of patients with IE. Finally, FDG PET/CT provides incremental prognostic value over other clinical and para-clinical parameters, enabling prediction of in-hospital mortality, IE recurrence, hospitalization, and new onset heart failure and embolic events. FDG PET/CT plays a key role in the investigation of patients with suspected IE, enabling detection of valvular infection and extra-cardiac manifestations of the infection which has important prognostic implications.","output":"Detection of Native and Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis: Incremental Attributes of Functional FDG PET/CT over Morphologic Imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 pandemic spawned new ways of learning, attitudes and skills in the dynamics and processes of education in rural areas This research aims to map a realistic casuistic picture of learning during the pandemic period in Sintang This research uses case studies in two schools namely Catholic Private Elementary School Panca Setya 2 Sintang and Sekolah DasarNegeri 23 Menyumbung, Sintang In collecting the data, the writers use observation, and in-depth interviews of teachers, students and parents Data analysis techniques use inductive analysis The results showed that anxiety and unpreparedness of learning became the dominant colors of the learning process during the covid-19 pandemic The micro learning strategy implemented by the school uses the assignment method, communication in WhatsApp group class Student assignments are given at the beginning of the week and collected on weekends by each parent Student test scores show improved graphs but the quality of learning outcomes still tends to be the same even there is a bias in the role of parents in answering student test questions The principal's micro strategy for pandemic learning has been directed towards technology-based learning methods although it is very limited to some learning videos, zoom meetings and google classrooms The biggest obstacle is the lack of technology infrastructure and the virtual literacy capabilities of teachers, parents and students In supporting micro learning strategies, the principal needs to strengthen the non-instructional character education policy of the classroom and develop a risk-taker character to encourage the role of teachers as teacher educators","output":"Micro strategy and character educational transformation in elementary school during the covid-19 pandemic of sintang distric, west kalimantan province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is the most challenging incident that people have faced in recent years Despite the time-consuming and expensive conventional methods, point-of-care diagnostics have a crucial role in deterrence, timely detection, and intensive care of the disease&#x2019;s progress Hence, this detrimental health emergency persuaded researchers to accelerate the development of highly-scalable diagnostic devices to control the propagation of the virus even in the least developed countries The strategies exploited for detecting COVID-19 stem from the already designed systems for studying other maladies, particularly viral infections The present report reviews not only the novel advances in portable diagnostic devices for recognizing COVID-19, but also the previously existing biosensors for detecting other viruses It discusses their adaptability for identifying surface proteins, whole viruses, viral genomes, host antibodies, and other biomarkers in biological samples The prominence of different types of biosensors such as electrochemical, optical, and electrical for detecting low viral loads have been underlined Thus, it is anticipated that this review will assist scientists who have embarked on a competition to come up with more efficient and marketable in-situ test kits for identifying the infection even in its incubation time without sample pretreatment Finally, a conclusion is provided to highlight the importance of such an approach for monitoring people to combat the spread of such contagious diseases IEEE","output":"Portable Sensing Devices for Detection of COVID-19: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are source of coronaviruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus.

Domain shifts can be caused, e.g., by changes in the disease prevalence (spreading or tested population), by refined RT-PCR testing procedures (taking samples, laboratory), or by virus mutations. Therefore, machine learning models for diagnosing COVID-19 or other diseases may not be reliable and degrade in performance over time. To countermand this effect, we propose methods that first identify domain shifts and then reverse their negative effects on the model performance. Frequent re-training and re-assessment, as well as stronger weighting of more recent samples, keeps model performance and credibility at a high level over time.

The degree of abnormalities correlates with clinical outcome. Imaging of the lungs using chest radiography (CXR) at the peak of a pandemic is considered a basic diagnostic tool at the triage stage. The CXR images are less characteristic than computed tomography (CT) and should be interpreted with a combination of clinical findings. OBJECTIVES Comparison of the usefulness of 2 CXR severity scores to evaluate the presence/severity of inflammation in the course of COVID-19 and the possibility of a non-radiologist to interpret the image independently. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of the medical records of 152 consecutive patients (aged 19-96, 73 men), infected with SARS-CoV-2, confirmed using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Five-point and twelve-point CXR severity scoring systems were used (independently by a radiologist and a referring physician) to assess the severity of inflammation. RESULTS In 77 of 152 cases, the CXR revealed features of inflammation. Bilateral abnormalities were found in 48/77 (62.3%) cases. Statistically, the lower lobes were involved more often than the upper ones (p < 0.001) and the left lobe more often than the right one (p < 0.001). The intensity of the abnormalities using both scales correlated with the persistence of symptoms (p = 0.0133 and p = 0.0403). A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between both scales and dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase activity. The interobserver agreement analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in the CXR severity score using the five-point (B = 0.8345, kappa = 0.82; p = 0.1480) or the twelve-point scale (B = 0.8219, kappa = 0.77; p = 0.0502).

Low loads of viral nucleic acid were found in two cats, but only one developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which suggests that cats have a limited role in COVID-19 epidemiology.","output":"Household Cases Suggest That Cats Belonging to Owners with COVID-19 Have a Limited Role in Virus Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to explore the relevant literature available regarding the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a mode of treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); to evaluate the evidence to support the use of rTMS as a treatment option for OCD. Design/methodology/approach The authors electronically conducted data search in five research databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO, SCOPUS and EMBASE) using all identified keywords and index terms across all the databases to identify empirical studies and randomized controlled trials. The authors included articles published with randomized control designs, which aimed at the treatment of OCD with rTMS. Only full-text published articles written in English were reviewed. Review articles on treatment for conditions other than OCD were excluded. The Covidence software was used to manage and streamline the review. Findings Despite the inconsistencies in the published literature, the application of rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the orbitofrontal cortex has proven to be promising in efficacy and tolerability compared with other target regions such as the prefrontal cortex for the treatment of OCD. Despite the diversity in terms of the outcomes and clinical variability of the studies under review, rTMS appears to be a promising treatment intervention for OCD. Research limitations/implications The authors of this scoping review acknowledge several limitations. First, the search strategy considered only studies published in English and the results are up to date as the last day of the electronic data search of December 10, 2020. Though every effort was made to identify all relevant studies for the purposes of this review per the eligibility criteria, the authors still may have missed some relevant studies, especially those published in other languages. Originality/value This review brought to bare the varying literature on the application of rTMS and what is considered gaps in the knowledge in this area in an attempt to evaluate and provide information on the potential therapeutic effects of rTMS for OCD.","output":"The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Realism has predominated in discussions about the coronavirus pandemic where politicians, authorities, and commentators debate over the substance and consequence of scientific facts. But while biology played a crucial role in triggering the pandemic, the resulting crisis developed through a social process. In this paper, I argue that the coronavirus pandemic in Britain was successfully framed as a crisis, but that the ritualization of solidarity normally generated by this meaning was compromised. Through an analysis of media coverage and official statements from the government, I trace the discursive construction of the crisis through the deployment of battle metaphors. Building on this discourse analysis, I show how the symbolic alignment of the pandemic and the Second World War revived symbols and tropes that informed the cultural construction of pandemic heroes. To explain why the intensity of the crisis framing was not matched in ritual performance, I consider how the governments ambiguous policies and erratic social performance produced a state of indefinite liminality, subverting solidarity processes in lockdown. The paper offers insight into the experience of anomie during the pandemic and contributes to the strong program in cultural sociology by incorporating the crisis approach in disaster studies into the social drama framework.","output":"Marking time in lockdown: heroization and ritualization in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this experimental study was to analyze the effect of 3-dimensional (3D) imaging in laparoendoscopic single-site surgery.

In response to this, mental health apps (MHapps) are becoming available for monitoring, managing, and promoting positive mental health and well-being. Thus far, evidence supports favorable outcomes when users engage with MHapps, yet there is a relative paucity of reviews on apps that support positive mental health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review the available research on MHapps that promote emotion regulation, positive mental health, and well-being in the general population aged 18-45 years. More specifically, the review aimed at providing a systematic description of the theoretical background and features of MHapps while evaluating any potential effectiveness. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of key databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), was performed until January 2021. Studies were included if they described standalone mental health and well-being apps for adults without a formal mental health diagnosis. The quality of all studies was assessed against the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In addition, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RoB-2) was used to assess randomized control trials (RCTs). Data were extracted using a modified extraction form from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were then undertaken to address the review aims. RESULTS: In total, 3156 abstracts were identified. Of these, 52 publications describing 48 MHapps met the inclusion criteria. Together, the studies evaluated interventions across 15 countries. Thirty-nine RCTs were identified suggesting some support for the role of individual MHapps in improving and promoting mental health and well-being. Regarding the pooled effect, MHapps, when compared to controls, showed a small effect for reducing mental health symptoms (k=19, Hedges g=C0.24, 95% CI C0.34 to C0.14; P<.001) and improving well-being (k=13, g=0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.29, P=.004), and a medium effect for emotion regulation (k=6, g=0.49, 95% CI 0.23-0.74, P<.001). There is also a wide knowledge base of creative and innovative ways to engage users in techniques such as mood monitoring and guided exercises. Studies were generally assessed to contribute unclear or a high risk of bias, or to be of medium to low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging evidence for MHapps that promote positive mental health and well-being suggests promising outcomes. Despite a wide range of MHapps, few apps specifically promote emotion regulation. However, our findings may position emotion regulation as an important mechanism for inclusion in future MHapps. A fair proportion of the included studies were pilot or feasibility trials (k=17, 33%), and full-scale RCTs reported high attrition rates and nondiverse samples. Given the number and pace at which MHapps are being released, further robust research is warranted to inform the development and testing of evidence-based programs.","output":"Mobile Apps That Promote Emotion Regulation, Positive Mental Health, and Well-being in the General Population: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis is the leading cause of surgical acute abdomen in pediatrics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, management strategies were reassessed and the number of visits to the emergency department dropped down, which may be associated with delayed diagnoses and complications. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on children with acute appendicitis. METHODS: Analytical, retrospective, comparative study of pediatric patients with acute appendicitis in the 5 months of COVID-19 lockdown versus the same period in the previous year. Incidence, clinical data, stage, surgical approach, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of appendicitis cases went down by 25% (n = 67 versus n = 50 in 2020). The mean time to consultation was 24 hours in both periods (p = 0.989). The incidence of peritonitis was 44% (n = 22) versus 37% (n = 22) (p = 0.22) in 2019. No differences were observed in terms of appendicitis stage based on surgery reports. In 2019, all surgeries were laparoscopic; while in 2020, only 42% (n = 21). The incidence of complications was 6% versus 7.5% in the previous period (p = 0.75). One patient was COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSION: Although in our population the number of appendicitis cases dropped down, consultation was not delayed. The greater impact was associated with the reformulation of management strategies, in which the laparoscopic approach is avoided to reduce virus transmission.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric population with acute appendicitis: Experience at a general, tertiary care hospital./ Impacto de la pandemia por COVID-19 en la poblacin peditrica con apendicitis aguda: experiencia en un hospital general de tercer nivel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeTo describe the incidence of pulmonary artery thrombosis in COVID-19 versus influenza pneumonia using CT angiography and to assess whether it may increase the risk of pulmonary hypertension.Materials and MethodsSingle and dual energy CT pulmonary angiography of age- and gender-matched patients with influenza and COVID-19 pneumonia, referred for extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and/or mechanical ventilation from January 2016 to January 2021, were retrospectively evaluated. Two independent observers qualitatively and quantitively assessed clot burden and Qanadli CT Obstruction Index. Two consensus observers calculated pulmonary artery volume and right to left ventricular diameter ratio (Terarecon, California, USA) to diagnose pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary infarct volume and perfused blood volume relative enhancement were also calculated (Syngo via, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). All radiologic parameters were correlated with clinical data. To assess if in situ thrombosis could be visualised on CT, isolated segmental and subsegmental filling defects were used as an imaging surrogate. For statistical analyses, Graphpad Prism9 and IBM SPSS v27.0 software were used.ResultsThe incidence of either central PE or DVT was equal between patients with COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia (20%). The incidence of isolated segmental and subsegmental filling defects was higher in COVID-19 but without statistical significance (44% vs 32%;p=0.5607).

Previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway, which would normally elicit a robust IFN response, but the mechanism(s) used by SARS PLpro to inhibit activation of the IRF3 pathway is not fully known. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how SARS PLpro efficiently inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway. We found that expression of the membrane-anchored PLpro domain (PLpro-TM) from SARS-CoV inhibits STING/TBK1/IKK-mediated activation of type I IFNs and disrupts the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which are activated by STING and TBK1. Meanwhile, we showed that PLpro-TM physically interacts with TRAF3, TBK1, IKK, STING, and IRF3, the key components that assemble the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex for activation of IFN expression. However, the interaction between the components in STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex is disrupted by PLpro-TM. Furthermore, SARS PLpro-TM reduces the levels of ubiquitinated forms of RIG-I, STING, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 in the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex. These results collectively point to a new mechanism used by SARS-CoV through which PLpro negatively regulates IRF3 activation by interaction with STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex, yielding a SARS-CoV countermeasure against host innate immunity.","output":"SARS coronavirus papain-like protease inhibits the type I interferon signaling pathway through interaction with the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction that has not been previously described in patients with ARDS due to other causes. The purpose of this report is to describe a case series of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS in which ETT occlusion resulted in significant clinical consequences and to define the pathology of the obstructing material. METHODS Incidents of ETT occlusion during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients were reported by clinicians and retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed comparing event rates between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients on mechanical ventilation over the predefined period. Specimens were collected and submitted for pathological examination. FINDINGS Eleven COVID-19 patients experienced endotracheal tube occlusion over a period of 2 months. Average age was 69 (14.3, range 33-85) years. Mean APACHE III score was 73.6 (17.3). All patients had AKI and cytokine storm. Nine exhibited biomarkers for hypercoagulability. Average days on mechanical ventilation before intervention for ETT occlusion was 14 (5.18) days (range of 9 to 23 days). Five patients were discharged from the ICU, and 4 expired. Average documented airway resistance on admission was 14.2 (3.0) cm H2O/L/sec. Airway resistance before tube exchange was 28.1 (8.0) cm H2O /L/sec. No similar events of endotracheal tube occlusion were identified in non-COVID patients on mechanical ventilation during the same time period. Microscopically, the material consisted of mucin admixed with necrotic cell debris, variable numbers of degenerated inflammatory cells, oral contaminants and red blood cells. INTERPRETATION Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ETT obstruction due to deposition of a thick, tenacious material within the tube that consists primarily of mucin and cellular debris.

The C3-C5 spinal cord is the location of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) that are responsible for diaphragm activation; PhMNs receive bulbospinal excitatory drive predominately from supraspinal neurons of the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). Cervical SCI results in rVRG axon damage, PhMN denervation, and consequent partial-to-complete paralysis of hemidiaphragm. In a rat model of C2 hemisection SCI, we expressed the axon guidance molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), selectively at the location of PhMNs (ipsilateral to lesion) to promote directed growth of rVRG axons toward PhMN targets by performing intraspinal injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2)-BDNF vector. AAV2-BDNF promoted significant functional diaphragm recovery, as assessed by in vivo electromyography. Within the PhMN pool ipsilateral to injury, AAV2-BDNF robustly increased sprouting of both spared contralateral-originating rVRG axons and serotonergic fibers. Furthermore, AAV2-BDNF significantly increased numbers of putative monosynaptic connections between PhMNs and these sprouting rVRG and serotonergic axons.

The acetaminophen absorption test (AAT) has been previously described as a direct method for assessment of GI function. Our study determines whether the AAT can be used to assess GI function in critically ill COVID-19 patients, compared with traditional measures of GI function. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of critically ill patients with COVID-19. SETTING: Three intensive care units at a tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty critically ill patients with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: The results of AAT and traditional measures for assessing GI function were collected and compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the study cohort, 55% (11 of 20) of patients had evidence of malabsorption by AAT. Interestingly, all patients with evidence of malabsorption by AAT had clinical evidence of bowel function, as indicated by stool output and low gastric residuals during the prior 24 h. When comparing patients with a detectable acetaminophen level (positive AAT) with those who had undetectable acetaminophen levels (negative AAT), radiologic evidence of ileus was less frequent (20 vs 88%; P = .03), tolerated tube-feed rates were higher (40 vs 10 ml/h; P =.01), and there was a trend toward lower gastric residual volumes (45 vs 830 ml; P =.11).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty tests were performed in a closed darkened room to measure SCON (1m circular around the manikin head (3.14 m(2)) via plan metrically assessment through fluorescence technique. HSP (handpiece, turbine (Kavo, Germany)) or APD (LM-ProPower(TM) (Finland), Airflow?-Prophylaxis-Master (Switzerland)) for 6 min plus 5 s post-treatment were performed either without suction or with low-flow (150 l/min for SAE) or high-flow rate (250 l/min/350 l/min for HC11/HC16) suction. All tests were two-tailed (p0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multi-testing). RESULTS: Irrespective the AGP, SCON was higher for NS (median [25th; 75th percentiles]: 3.4% [2.6; 5.4]) versus high-flow suction (1.9% [1.5; 2.5]) (p=0.002). Low-flow suction (3.5% [2.6; 4.3]) versus NS resulted in slightly lower but not statistically significantly lower SCON (p=1.000) and was less effective than high-flow suction (p=0.003).

Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (hereafter \\"pharmacomechanical thrombolysis\\") rapidly removes thrombus and is hypothesized to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome. METHODS We randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis to receive either anticoagulation alone (control group) or anticoagulation plus pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting). The primary outcome was development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the post-thrombotic syndrome (47% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 48% in the control group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.11; P=0.56). Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led to more major bleeding events within 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3% of patients, P=0.049), but no significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism was seen over the 24-month follow-up period (12% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 8% in the control group, P=0.09). Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 18% of patients in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group versus 24% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P=0.04).

There is a significant relationship between therapeutic education and the regularity of the INR control in lockdown (p = 0.01) and between the regularity of the INR control and an INR after lockdown in a therapeutic zone (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively given-Namesed the quality of care of patients on VKA, particularly in the absence of therapeutic education. The management of these patients during this pandemic had to be adjusted.

Many of them represents natural libraries of compounds with interesting biological activities due to differently functionalized drimane nucleus exploitable for potential pharmacological applications. The transient receptor potential channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) channel has recently emerged as a pharmacological target for several respiratory diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Inspired by the labdane-like bicyclic core, a series of homodrimane-derived esters and amides was designed and synthesized by modifying the flexible tail in position 1 of (+)-sclareolide, an oxidized derivative of the bioactive labdane-type diterpene sclareol. The potency and selectivity towards rTRPV4 and hTRPV1 receptors were assessed by calcium influx cellular assays. Molecular determinants critical for eliciting TRPV4 antagonism were identified by structure-activity relationships. Among the selective TRPV4 antagonists identified, compound 6 was the most active with an IC(50) of 5.3 M. This study represents the first report of semisynthetic homodrimane TRPV4 antagonists, selective over TRPV1, and potentially useful as pharmacological tools for the development of novel TRPV4 channel modulators.","output":"Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Experimental Validation of Novel TRPV4 Antagonists Inspired by Labdane Diterpenes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (NET) has become a useful tool for the downstaging of luminal-like breast cancers in postmenopausal patients. It enables us to increase breast- conserving surgery (BCS) rates, provides an opportunity for us to assess in vivo NET effectiveness, and allows us to study any biological changes that may act as valid biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NET, and to assess the role of Ki67 proliferation rate changes as an indicator of endocrine responsiveness. Methods: From 2016 to 2020, a single-institution cohort of patients, treated with NET and further surgery, was evaluated. In patients with Ki67  10%, a second core biopsy was performed after four weeks. Information regarding histopathological and clinical changes was gathered. Results: A total of 115 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/HER2-negative patients were included. The median treatment duration was 5.0 months (IQR: 2.0C6.0). The median maximum size in the surgical sample was 40% smaller than the pretreatment size measured by ultrasound (p < 0.0001). The median pretreatment Ki67 expression was 20.0% (IQR: 12.0C30.0), and was reduced to 5.0% (IQR: 1.8C10.0) after four weeks, and to 2.0% (IQR: 1.0C8.0) in the surgical sample (p < 0.0001). BCS was performed on 98 patients (85.2%). No pathological complete responses were recorded. A larger Ki67 fold change after four weeks was significantly related to a PEPI score of zero (p < 0.002). No differences were observed between luminal A- and B-like tumors, with regard to fold change and PEPI score. Conclusions: In our cohort, NET was proven to be effective for tumor size and Ki67 downstaging. This resulted in a higher rate of conservative surgery, aided in therapeutic decision making, provided prognostic information, and constituted a safe and well-tolerated approach.","output":"The Clinical Impact of Neoadjuvant Endocrine Treatment on Luminal-like Breast Cancers and Its Prognostic Significance: Results from a Single-Institution Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Since December 2019, more than 80,000 patients have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Social support status of COVID-19 patients, especially the impact of social support on their psychological status and quality of life, needs to be addressed with increasing concern. Objectives: In this study, we used social support rating scale (SSRS) to investigate the social support in COVID-19 patients and nurses. Methods: The present study included 186 COVID-19 patients at a Wuhan mobile cabin hospital and 234 nurses at a Wuhan COVID-19 control center. Responses to a mobile phone app-based questionnaire about social support, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were recorded and evaluated. Results: COVID-19 patients scored significantly lower than nurses did on the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Among these patients, 33.9% had anxiety symptoms, while 23.7% had depression symptoms. Overall SSRS, subjective social support scores and objective support scores of patients with anxiety were lower than those of patients without anxiety. This result was also found in depression. In addition, all dimensions of social support were positively correlated with quality of life. Interestingly, in all dimensions of social support, subjective support was found to be an independent predictive factor for anxiety, depression, and quality of life, whereas objective support was a predictive factor for quality of life, but not for anxiety and depression via regression analysis. Conclusion: Medical staffs should pay attention to the subjective feelings of patients and make COVID-19 patients feel respected, supported, and understood from the perspective of subjective support, which may greatly benefit patients, alleviate their anxiety and depression, and improve their quality of life.","output":"Less Social Support for Patients With COVID-19: Comparison With the Experience of Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful reproductive management of buffaloes depends primarily upon timely estrus identification. However, 50% of the estrus events are undetected in buffaloes with the available estrus identification methods, leading to huge financial loss to buffalo farmers. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an alternative and accurate estrus identification method, particularly on the basis of biomarkers in non-invasive fluids. Thus, the present study aimed to identify RNA based estrus biomarkers in cell free saliva in Bubalus bubalis, so that they can be used for future field applicable RT-LAMP colour reactions. RNA-Seq analysis of cell free salivary RNA showed 49 differentially abundant mRNAs between the estrus and diestrus stages. Among five mature miRNAs predicted from the RNA-Seq data, four were found differentially altered at the estrus stage than the diestrus stage. Validation study by direct salivary transcript analysis (DSTA) on 6 selected mRNAs (PPARGC1a, TIMP1, PEBP4, CSPG5, PRHR and ATOH7) and 5 miRNAs (bta-miR-92b, bta-miR-302d, bta-miR-141, bta-miR-27a and bta-let-7a-5p) showed significantly higher levels of TIMP1 (3.46 fold; P < 0.5) and bta-mir-141 (1.33 fold; P < 0.5) in cell-free saliva at the estrus stage compared to the diestrus stage. Hence, TIMP1 and miR-141 appear to be the possible transcript biomarkers for estrus in the cell free saliva of the buffalo.

Many HIV-positive individuals have difficulty maintaining follow-up clinic visits under normal circumstances, and this is complicated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as many institutions transition to a telehealth-focused model of care to maintain patient and provider safety. However, it was unknown how telehealth would impact patient attendance and perceptions about their care, particularly in populations at high risk of appointment nonattendance. To quantify the impact of telehealth on retention in care for a vulnerable HIV-infected population and to identify patient perspectives of telehealth and its effect on appointment attendance, we studied patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 360 Wellness Center, an HIV primary care clinic in urban San Francisco, California. Anonymous surveys were conducted to assess patient perceptions of telehealth, and 21% of patients sent surveys responded. Appointment attendance rates for all visits were analyzed before and after the shelter-in-place order in San Francisco on March 16, 2020. With the transition to telehealth, the overall nonattendance rate decreased by 3%. Most common perceived strengths of telehealth included convenience and safety, whereas disadvantages included technical barriers and unfamiliarity. Despite barriers and disadvantages listed by patients, a majority are willing to attend telehealth visits, as 80.5% of respondents reported being equally or more likely to attend telehealth visits. This is a critical finding during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; we believe that telehealth can improve appointment attendance for vulnerable populations who often face barriers to receiving health care.","output":"Transitioning to Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patient Perspectives and Attendance at an HIV Clinic in San Francisco."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphene oxide (GO) derivatives are reported as a valid alternative to conventional carriers of therapeutic agents, because they have a large surface area, an excellent electrical and thermal conductivity and a great capacity for selective binding of drugs and therapeutics, due to the functionalization of their surfaces, edges and sides.

Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed. To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance. Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery. A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.

Fishes are well known to be highly sensitive to the environment, hence they require proper care and attention from their owners. Many a times they forget to feed the fish, change the water, check the pH levels etc. these problems look simple but when it comes to tracking hundreds of fishes it can be difficult, these issues can be easily resolved by using IoT. An IoT system that can be highly beneficial for small to large scale aquariums is necessary e.g. Dubai Aquarium (where hundreds of fishes are constantly monitored). The System can be used to create the ideal conditions required for high yield. The aquaculture sector is going to play a crucial role in the future economy as fishes are getting scarce all over the world. Steps must be taken to streamline processes and by which increase efficiency while improving fish health. IoT based Aquariums can save Ocean Wildlife by building reliable systems that are capable of real-time data processing. Massive tanks can be built for endangered species in remote locations further increasing biodiversity and building a balanced ecosystem. Larger fishes can be monitored using technologies such as RFID, transmitters, etc. since it can be difficult to monitor them in large tanks. Data received from sensors can be stored in some cloud platform and analyzed for future predictions and redundant storage, all sorts of smart devices are able to communicate with each other regardless of hardware and operating system used. The IoT based Aquarium Monitoring device is capable of capturing the water levels inside the aquarium and notifies the user by email when its low. It can switch on/off the lights of the aquarium, control the automatic feeder using and record the room temperature and humidity readings with the help of AWS technologies. The fish feeder is controlled by the user using a voice application or web/app interface. Parameters used in this project are Room Temperature, Humidity, Water Level, LED status and Feeder status. Sensor acquisition is performed by ESP-32, it is also used as data processing device as well as local server/controller. User can monitor the conditions of the aquarium locally or remotely from any part of the world as long as he/she has an Internet connection since data is processed through AWS Lambda, stored in DynamoDB and hosted in AWS API.

Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRARSV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site. Although phosphoregulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.","output":"Biochemical evidence of furin specificity and potential for phospho-regulation at Spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site in SARS-CoV2 but not in SARS-CoV1 or MERS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 15 years, thoracic ultrasound has been applied in the evaluation of numerous lung diseases, demonstrating a variable diagnostic predictive power compared to traditional imaging techniques such as chest radiography and CT. However, in unselected pulmonary patients, there are no rigorous scientific demonstrations of the complementarity of thoracic ultrasound with traditional and standardized imaging techniques that use radiation. In this study 101 unselected pulmonary patients were evaluated blindly with ultrasound chest examinations during their hospital stay. Other instrumental examinations, carried out during hospitalization, were standard chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and, when needed, radioisotopic investigation and cardiac catheterization. The operator who performed the ultrasound examinations was unaware of the anamnestic and clinical data of the patients. Diffuse fibrosing disease was detected with a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 100%, 95% and 97%, respectively. In pleural effusions, ultrasound showed a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 100%. In consolidations, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 83%, 98% and 93%, respectively. Low values of sensitivity were recorded for surface nodulations of less than one centimeter. Isolated subpleural ground glass densities were identified as White Lung with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 86%. Only the associations Diffuse ultrasound findings/Definitive fibrosing disease, Ultrasound Consolidation/Definitive consolidation and non-diffuse ultrasound artefactual features/Definitive vascular pathology (pulmonary hypertension, embolism) were statistically significant with adjusted residuals of 7.9, 7 and 4.1, respectively.

In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

Hybrid scaffolds comprised collagen sponge and poly L-lactide (PLLA) sheets. Abdominal wall defects were covered by three kinds of sheets. Thereafter, the bone marrow liquid was spread onto the sheets. Rats were killed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Pathological examinations were performed using hematoxylin-eosin and desmin antibody staining. RESULTS The CS group showed abdominal hernia, whereas the HS and HSBM groups did not. Vascular formation was confirmed in all groups. Muscle tissue was recognized at the marginal area of the sheet only in the HSBM group. CONCLUSION The HS and HSBM groups show a greater intensity than the CS group.

Binding of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, to its viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), results in viral entry and may cause AKI. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the frequencies of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill COVID-19 patients and compared those frequencies with patients who were infected by respiratory viruses that bind or downregulate ACE2 (ACE2-associated viruses) and viruses that do not bind nor downregulate ACE2 (non-ACE2-associated viruses). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Observational studies on COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections reporting AKI and RRT were included. The exclusion criteria were non-English articles, non-peer-reviewed articles, review articles, studies that included patients under the age of 18, studies including fewer than 10 patients, and studies not reporting AKI and RRT rates. PATIENTS: Adult COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and influenza patients. MEASUREMENTS: We extracted the following data from the included studies: author, year, study location, age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, shock, vasopressor use, mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU mortality, AKI, and RRT. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE for articles reporting AKI or RRT. AKI was defined by authors of included studies. Critical illness was defined by ICU admission. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled estimates for the AKI and RRT rate within each virus group using a random intercept logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 23 655 hospitalized, critically ill COVID-19 patients, AKI frequencies were not significantly different between COVID-19 patients (51%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 44%-57%) and critically ill patients infected with ACE2-associated (56%, 95% CI: 37%-74%, P = .610) or non-ACE2-associated viruses (63%, 95% CI: 43%-79%, P = .255). Pooled RRT rates were also not significantly different between critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (20%, 95% CI: 16%-24%) and ACE2-associated viruses (18%, 95% CI: 8%-33%, P = .747). RRT rates for both COVID-19 and ACE2-associated viruses were significantly different (P < .001 for both) from non-ACE2-associated viruses (49%, 95% CI: 44%-54%). After adjusting for shock or vasopressor use, AKI and RRT rates were not significantly different between groups. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include the heterogeneity of definitions of AKI that were used across different virus studies. We could not match severity of infection or do propensity matching across studies. Most of the included studies were conducted in retrospective fashion. Last, we did not include non-English publications. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that viral ACE2 association does not significantly alter the rates of AKI and RRT among critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. However, the rate of RRT is lower in patients with COVID-19 or ACE2-associated viruses when compared with patients infected with non-ACE2-binding viruses, which might partly be due to the lower frequencies of shock and use of vasopressors in these two virus groups. Prospective studies are necessary to demonstrate whether modulation of the ACE2 axis with Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors impacts the rates of AKI and whether they are beneficial or harmful in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Replacement Therapy in COVID-19 Versus Other Respiratory Viruses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between infectious disease and therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains unknown.

OBJECTIVE: To assess for socioeconomic and imaging exam factors associated with missed appointments among children scheduled for diagnostic imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed children (<18 years) scheduled for outpatient diagnostic imaging during a 12-month period. In doing so, we obtained socioeconomic and radiology exam characteristics (modality, intravenous contrast administration, radiation and use of sedation) data from the electronic medical record. We employed multivariate logistic regression to assess the association of socioeconomic, demographic and imaging exam characteristics with imaging missed appointments. RESULTS: In total, 7,275 children met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 8.8 years (standard deviation [SD] = 6.2 years) and the study population consisted of 52% female gender, 69% White race, 38% adolescent age group and 32% with a median household income by ZIP-code category of <$50,000. Logistic regression showed increased likelihood of missed appointments among children of Black/African-American race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.5); with insurance categories including Medicaid (OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.6-2.4), self-pay (OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.3-3.6) and other (OR=2.7; 95% CI=1.3-5.4); with <$50,000 median household income by ZIP-code category (OR=1.7; 95% CI=1.4-2.0); and with examination wait time of 7-21 days (OR=2.7; 95% CI=2.1-3.5) and >21 days (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.9-4.8). The use of radiation, intravenous contrast agent or sedation was not associated with increased likelihood of missed appointments.

PARTICIPANTS The study was conducted among 633 participants living in Gurage Zone from 1 February to 28 February 2020. 618 completed the questionnaire. A multistage sampling technique was employed to obtain study participants. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted by 20 experienced and trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire. To assess knowledge, 10 questions were adopted from the WHO questionnaire, which is a standardised and structured questionnaire used internationally. Data were entered into EpiData V.3.1 and exported to SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) V.24 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed and the findings were presented in text, figures and tables. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between each independent variable and the outcome variable. All variables with p<0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model and statistical significance was declared at p<0.05. Voluntary consent was taken from all participants. RESULTS A total of 618 participants were included in the study, with a response rate of 97.6%. Of the participants, 40.7% had good knowledge (95% CI 36.3 to 44.2).

Specific identification of both targets was elucidated by melt curve analysis, in which the BCoV amplified product generated a melt peak at 78.35  0.26 C and the internal control RNA at 82.54  0.32 C. The assay was highly specific since all negative controls and other viruses of clinical and structural relevance failed to develop any positive results. The detection limit of the reaction was 10(3) plasmid copies and 1.17  10(?3) TCID(50) of the tissue culture propagated virus. Standard deviation and coefficient of variation was low for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. The assay performance on field samples was evaluated on 103 (68 fecal and 35 nasal) swab specimens and compared with the conventional RT-PCR assay. The results of both assays matched for the diagnosis of 65 fecal and 33 nasal samples. However, three fecal and two nasal samples tested negative in gel-based assay were positive for the real-time RT-PCR. The robustness and a high-throughput performance of the developed assay make it a powerful tool in diagnostic applications and in BCoV research.","output":"Development of a SYBR Green I based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and quantification of bovine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our study found that Florida experienced 19 241 excess deaths from March to September 2020.1 Official numbers link 14 317 of these deaths to COVID-19, suggesting that 4924 excess deaths are unexplained.

This article discusses the role of personal needs in epidemic control and linked psychological needs with management measures to propose intervention advice on curbing viral transmission in a systematic way. METHODS: Based on case studies, we showed the integration of the Maslows Hierarchy of Needs in the COVID-19 risk chain. The analysis combined the micro-view from individual needs and macro influences from governmental measures. The proposed chain of vulnerabilities could help identify critical links of COVID-19 crisis management in case that cascading effects such as super-spread can be intercepted in time. RESULTS: The article mainly focused on curbing the viral transmission timely whenever cluster of cases resurge. Considering the triggered activities from personal needs may facilitate the spread, minimizing the impact scale while managing the crisis could start with protecting vulnerable population, well governing potential hotspots, and necessary restrictions on group activities. Besides, individual protections combined with institutional solutions are strongly advocated. The worst scenario would be the governance link slackened or made mistakes, together with delayed identification, plus unprotected way of living and gathering. In order to cut the transmission in time, besides virus-blocking strategies and vaccination approach, screening measures in combination with the satisfaction of personal needs would help identify confirmed cases earlier. Publicizing the model citizen of being responsible could show needs satisfaction can live with the virus elimination. At the emergency response stage, it is also crucial to secure fewer loopholes in the health system and strengthen the self-protection barrier by all means. CONCLUSION: Chinas experience offers a reference for the balance between the resurgence of clustered cases and sustained recovery. As long as the global pandemic continues, its impact on personal activities will not stop, and vice versa. The chain of vulnerabilities integrating psychological needs into the COVID-19 risk management can provide clear clues for cutting further transmission in an efficient and more socially acceptable way.","output":"Preventing the Growing Transmission of COVID Clusters: An Integration of the Maslows Hierarchy of Needs in the Risk Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The viral load and tissue distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain important questions. The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia.

It coincides with the 'problem of the veil,' a bone of contention in Islam/West relationships. More specifically, it will address the question of why the pandemic has changed the proxemics of public spaces and the grammar of 'living together.' For some time-and it is not possible to foresee how much-in many countries people cannot go out, or enter any public places, without wearing a sanitary mask. In short, almost all of us, by obligation or by urgent advice from the public authorities of the various countries, will not live the public sphere with our faces uncovered. The alteration of the social context affecting many Western countries will inevitably involve also the 'local' perception of the Islamic veil and-as a matter of equality-the consistency of the prohibition of wearing it. What will thus become of the ban on wearing it in public places established by some countries such as France and asseverated by the ECHR? If everyone can and will have to go around with their faces covered, why should only Islamic women be discriminated against? Will not the change in boundary conditions produced by Covid-19 also induce Western people to re-categorize the meaning of the veil? And will this re-categorization not directly affect the 'fact' of wearing the veil, that is, its empirical perception? And still, will this psycho-semantic change not show how empirical perceptions are cultural constructs rather than 'objective facts,' as such allegedly independent from the observer's point of view? Consequentially, will the plurality of perceptions and cultural meanings related to the gesture of covering one's own face not gain renewed relevance in determining the legitimacy of wearing the veil? The socio-semantic earthquake produced by Covid-19 compels us to rethink this and other issues orbiting around the translation of 'facts' into legal language; furthermore, it highlights the instrumentality of many ideological/partisan and ethnocentric assumptions passed off as objectivity regarding those alleged 'facts.' The essay will attempt to provide an answer to the above questions by proposing a semiotic-legal approach to intercultural conflicts and, indirectly, the pluralism in law.","output":"Don't Uncover that Face!

Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus in several animal models has been reported, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. Therefore, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/01/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003), and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) influenza viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and pdm09H1N1 early in infection but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism and coagulation signaling genes. This three-pronged transcriptomic signature was observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza virus strains. Finally, we used host transcriptomic profiling to computationally predict drugs that reverse the host response to H7N9 infection, and we identified six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE Emerging avian influenza viruses are of global concern because the human population is immunologically naive to them. Current influenza drugs target viral molecules, but the high mutation rate of influenza viruses eventually leads to the development of antiviral resistance. As the host evolves far more slowly than the virus, and influenza pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response, targeting the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza. Here we characterize the host transcriptomic response to emerging H7N9 influenza virus and compare it with the responses to H7N7, H5N1, and pdm09H1N1. All three avian viruses were pathogenic in mice and elicited a transcriptomic signature that also occurs in response to the legendary 1918 influenza virus. Our work identifies host responses that could be targeted to treat severe H7N9 influenza and identifies six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed as H7N9 influenza therapeutics.","output":"H7N9 and other pathogenic avian influenza viruses elicit a three-pronged transcriptomic signature that is reminiscent of 1918 influenza virus and is associated with lethal outcome in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of studies evaluating the effectiveness of branded CSR campaigns are concentrated and base their conclusions on data collection through self-reporting questionnaires. Although such studies provide insights for evaluating the effectiveness of CSR communication methods, analysing the message that is communicated, the communication channel used and the explicit brain responses of those for whom the message is intended, they lack the ability to fully encapsulate the problem of communicating environmental messages by not taking into consideration what the recipients implicit brain reactions are presenting. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CSR video communications relating to environmental issues through the lens of the recipients implicit self, by employing neuroscience-based assessments. For the examination of implicit brain perception, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was used, and the collected data was analysed through three indicators identified as the most influential indicators on human behaviour. These three indicators are emotional valence, the level of brain engagement and cognitive load. The study is conducted on individuals from the millennial generation in Thessaloniki, Greece, whose implicit brain responses to seven branded commercial videos are recorded. The seven videos were a part of CSR campaigns addressing environmental issues. Simultaneously, the self-reporting results from the participants were gathered for a comparison between the explicit and implicit brain responses. One of the key findings of the study is that the explicit and implicit brain responses differ to the extent that the CSR video communications brain friendliness has to be taken into account in the future, to ensure success.

In the last decades, several works demonstrated how configurational properties of the street network and morphological descriptors of the urban built environment are significantly related to store distribution. However, two main challenges still need to be addressed. On the one side, the combined effect of different urban form properties should be considered providing a holistic study of the urban form and its relationship to retail patterns. On the other, analytical approaches should consider the discrete, skewed and zero-inflated nature of the micro-retail distribution. To overcome these limitations, this work compares two sophisticated modelling procedure: Penalised Count Regression and Machine Learning approaches. While the former is specifically conceived to account for retail count distribution, the latter can capture non-linear behaviours in the data. The two modelling procedures are implemented on the same large dataset of street-based measures describing the urban form of the French Riviera.

The Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) implemented an internally validated readmission risk score in the electronic medical record (EMR). OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the predictive accuracy of the readmission risk score across CCHS hospitals, across primary discharge diagnosis categories, between surgical/medical specialties, and by race and ethnicity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients discharged from a CCHS hospital April 2017CSeptember 2020. MAIN MEASURES: Data was obtained from the CCHS EMR and billing databases. All patients discharged from a CCHS hospital were included except those from Oncology and Labor/Delivery, patients with hospice orders, or patients who died during admission. Discharges were categorized as surgical if from a surgical department or surgery was performed. Primary discharge diagnoses were classified per Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classifications Software Level 1 categories. Discrimination performance predicting 30-day readmission is reported using the c-statistic. RESULTS: The final cohort included 600,872 discharges from 11 Northeast Ohio and Florida CCHS hospitals. The readmission risk score for the cohort had a c-statistic of 0.6875 with consistent yearly performance. The c-statistic for hospital sites ranged from 0.6762, CI [0.6634, 0.6876], to 0.7023, CI [0.6903, 0.7132]. Medical and surgical discharges showed consistent performance with c-statistics of 0.6923, CI [0.6807, 0.7045], and 0.6802, CI [0.6681, 0.6925], respectively. Primary discharge diagnosis showed variation, with lower performance for congenital anomalies and neoplasms. COVID-19 had a c-statistic of 0.6387.

Tumour cell epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) increases their metastatic potential and facilitates their survival in the blood as circulating tumour cells (CTCs). The aim of this study was to molecularly characterise CTCs in a panel of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts using genes associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, and to compare the EMP status of CTCs with their matched primary tumours. The study highlights high heterogeneity in CTC enumeration and EMP gene expression between tumour-bearing mice and within individual blood samples, and therefore caution should be taken when interpreting pooled CTC analyses. Critically, tumour cells were present in the epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid state in the circulation. The study also demonstrates that there is high variation in CTC size, which would introduce sample bias to size-based CTC isolation techniques. ABSTRACT: Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) status of primary tumours has relevance to metastatic potential and therapy resistance. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) provide a window into the metastatic process, and molecular characterisation of CTCs in comparison to their primary tumours could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the metastatic cascade. In this study, paired blood and tumour samples were collected from four prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (BM18, LuCaP70, LuCaP96, LuCaP105) and assessed using an EMP-focused, 42 gene human-specific, nested quantitative RT-PCR assay. CTC burden varied amongst the various xenograft models with LuCaP96 having the highest number of CTCs per mouse (mean: 704; median: 31) followed by BM18 (mean: 101; median: 21), LuCaP70 (mean: 73; median: 16) and LuCaP105 (mean: 57; median: 6). A significant relationship was observed between tumour size and CTC number (p = 0.0058). Decreased levels of kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) mRNA (which encodes prostate-specific antigen; PSA) were observed in CTC samples from all four models compared to their primary tumours. Both epithelial- and mesenchymal-associated genes were commonly expressed at higher levels in CTCs compared to the bulk primary tumour, although some common EMT-associated genes (CDH1, VIM, EGFR, EPCAM) remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence co-staining for pan-cytokeratin (KRT) and vimentin (VIM) indicated variable proportions of CTCs across the full EMP axis, even in the same model. EMP hybrids predominated in the BM18 and LuCaP96 models, but were not detected in the LuCaP105 model, and variable numbers of KRT(+) and human VIM(+) cells were observed in each model. SERPINE1, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), was enriched at the RNA level in CTCs compared to primary tumours and was the most commonly expressed mesenchymal gene in the CTCs. Co-staining for SERPINE1 and KRT revealed SERPINE1(+) cells in 7/11 samples, six of which had SERPINE(+)KRT(+) CTCs. Cell size variation was observed in CTCs. The majority of samples (8/11) contained larger CTCs ranging from 15.3 to 37.8 m, whilst smaller cells (10.7  4.1 m, similar in size to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) were identified in 6 of 11 samples. CTC clusters were also identified in 9/11 samples, containing 2C100 CTCs per cluster. Where CTC heterogeneity was observed in the clusters, epithelial-like cells (KRT(+)VIM(?)) were located on the periphery of the cluster, forming a layer around hybrid (KRT(+)VIM(+)) or mesenchymal-like (KRT(?)VIM(+)) cells. The CTC heterogeneity observed in these models emphasises the complexity in CTC isolation and classification and supports the increasingly recognised importance of the epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid state in cancer progression and metastasis.","output":"Diversity of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Phenotypes in Circulating Tumour Cells from Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has already undergone several mutations, the impact of these mutations on its infectivity and virulence remains controversial. In this viewpoint, we present arguments suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 mutants responsible for the second wave have less virulence but much higher infectivity. This suggestion is based on the results of the forecasting and mechanistic models developed by our study group. In particular, in May 2020, the analysis of our mechanistic model predicted that the easing of lockdown measures will lead to a dramatic second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, after the lockdown was lifted in many European countries, the resulting number of reported infected cases and especially the number of deaths remained low for approximately two months. This raised the false hope that a substantial second wave will be avoided and that the COVID-19 epidemic in these European countries was nearing an end. Unfortunately, since the first week of August 2020, the number of reported infected cases increased dramatically. Furthermore, this was accompanied by an increasingly large number of deaths. The rate of reported infected cases in the second wave was much higher than that in the first wave, whereas the rate of deaths was lower. This trend is consistent with higher infectivity and lower virulence. Even if the mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent, the very high number of reported infected cases implies that a large number of people will perish.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: The Second Wave in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an attempt to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, policy makers and scientific experts who advise them have aspired to present a unified front. Leveraging the authority of science, they have at times portrayed politically favored COVID interventions, such as lockdowns, as strongly grounded in scientific evidenceeven to the point of claiming that enacting such interventions is simply a matter of following the science. Strictly speaking, all such claims are false, since facts alone never yield moral-political conclusions. More importantly, attempts to present a unified front have led to a number of other actions and statements by scientists and policy makers that erode the authority of science. These include actions and statements that: (1) mislead the public about epidemiological matters such as mortality rates, cause of death determinations, and computerized modeling, or fail to correct mainstream media sources that interpret such concepts in misleading ways; (2) incorporate moral-political opinions into ostensible statements of fact; and (3) misrepresent or misuse scientific expertise. The fundamental thesis of the paper is not primarily that such actions and statements have proliferated during the COVID-19 epidemic (though I think they have), but rather that they are unscientific and that presenting them as science undermines the authority of science. In the moral-political realm, the great power of science and the source of its authority derives from its agnosticism about fundamental moral-political claims. Science, for instance, has no built-in presumption that we should respect life, promote freedom, or practice toleration; nor does it tell us which of these values to prioritize when values conflict. Because of this agnosticism, science is recognized across a broad diversity perspectives as morally and politically impartial, and authoritative within its proper sphere.

Both direct and indirect consequences from COVID-19 infection are recognized to give rise to cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Despite current limited knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy appear to play critical roles in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD). One of the major subtypes of CVD is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) which represents a spectrum of pathological processes of various etiologies affecting the brain microcirculation that can trigger subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prevalent with aging, CSVD is a recognized risk factor for stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. In the background of COVID-19 infection, the heightened cellular activations from inflammations and oxidative stress may result in elevated levels of microthrombogenic extracellular-derived circulating microparticles (MPs). Consequently, MPs could act as pro-coagulant risk factor that may serve as microthrombi for the vulnerable microcirculation in the brain leading to CSVD manifestations. This review aims to appraise the accumulating body of evidence on the plausible impact of COVID-19 infection on the formation of microthrombogenic MPs that could lead to microthrombosis in CSVD manifestations, including occult CSVD which may last well beyond the pandemic era.","output":"COVID-19 Infection and Circulating Microparticles-Reviewing Evidence as Microthrombogenic Risk Factor for Cerebral Small Vessel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of the corona crisis requires new methods and approaches that could help flatten the curve.

When the accelerated evolution enters a positive feedback loop with the expanding epidemics, the pathogens runaway evolution may be triggered. To test this possibility in COVID-19, we analyze the extensive databases and identify 5 major waves of strains, one replacing the previous one in 2020 - 2021. The mutations differ entirely between waves and the number of mutations continues to increase, from 3-4 to 21-31. The latest wave is the Delta strain which accrues 31 new mutations to become highly prevalent. Interestingly, these new mutations in Delta strain emerge in multiple stages with each stage driven by 6 - 12 coding mutations that form a fitness group. In short, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the oldest to the youngest wave, and from the earlier to the later stages of the Delta wave, is a process of acceleration with more and more mutations. The global increase in the viral population size (M(t), at time t) and the mutation accumulation (R(t)) may have indeed triggered the runaway evolution in late 2020, leading to the highly evolved Alpha and then Delta strain. To suppress the pandemic, it is crucial to break the positive feedback loop between M(t) and R(t), neither of which has yet to be effectively dampened by late 2021.

RESULTS: In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16- monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16+ monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes.

HLA-DR+ monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation.

The protective action of Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) documented in these studies provides a mechanistic explanation for the lack of worse outcomes in high-risk COVID-19 patients on RAS blockers.","output":"Angiotensin II Promotes SARS-CoV-2 Infection via Upregulation of ACE2 in Human Bronchial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a worldwide threat to community health, social stability, and economic development. Since the first case was recorded on December 29, 2019, in Wuhan of China, the disease has rapidly extended to other nations of the world to claim many lives, especially in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. To stay ahead of the curve consequent of the continued increase in case and mortality, predictive tools are needed to guide adequate response. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA' COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.","output":"Comparison of Predictive Models and Impact Assessment of Lockdown for COVID-19 over the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, exploit cellular pathways and resources in a variety of fascinating ways. A striking example of this is the remodelling of intracellular membranes into specialized structures that support the replication of positive-sense ssRNA (+RNA) viruses infecting eukaryotes. These distinct forms of virus-induced structures include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), found during viral infections as diverse and notorious as those of coronaviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, or hepatitis C virus. Our understanding of these DMVs has evolved over the past 15 years thanks to advances in imaging techniques and modern molecular biology tools.

Our Rehabilitation Institute offered a telemedicine service to COVID-19 patients discharged after hospitalization. Methods: Patients transferred from Emergency, Intensive Care, and Pulmonology departments of the principal regional hospital hubs had an average stay in our hospital of 2-3 weeks. On discharge, at home, they underwent a telecare nursing and specialist teleconsultation program for 3 months, including monitoring of vital signs and symptoms. Patients completed the SF-12 questionnaire at the start and end of the program and rated their satisfaction with it. Results: The program involved 130 patients (51%). During the period, there were 14  2 (1,800 in total) telenursing support phone calls per patient made, and 12.5  3.4 oxygen saturation readings per patient (1,631 in total). Persisting symptoms, frequently in combination, were present at the start of the program in 124 (94%) patients. There was a significant reduction of symptoms (p < 0.0000) after the telecare program. The physical component of SF-12 significantly improved at the end [(t1-t0) = 6.7  9.3, p < 0.0001]. On the contrary, the mental component of SF-12 remained unchanged or decreased slightly in patients 70 years of age [(t1-t0) = -2.7  12.3, ns], while it decreased significantly [(t1-t0) = -5.4  12.4, p = 0.0367] in older patients (although remaining mild). Patient satisfaction with the program was very high in all 130 patients. Conclusions: Our Telehealth and Telecare Service offers an example of rapid scaling and adaptation of an existing program to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients.

All formulations had probiotic counts higher than 107 CFU/ml during storage and simulated gastrointestinal conditions (SGIC). The prebiotic components increased the probiotic survival to the enteric phase of the SGIC, with inulin producing the most pronounced effect. Inulin addition resulted in products with lower pH values and consistency and higher titratable acidity during storage, with negative impact on the sensory acceptance (flavor, texture, and overall impression) at the end of the storage period. Modified starch addition impacted negatively on the acceptance of the products (appearance, flavor, texture, and overall impression). Polydextrose addition resulted in products with lower consistency, but similar sensory acceptance to the full-fat yogurt.

However, a fine balance of activators and inhibitors of parietal cell-mediated acid secretion is required to ensure proper digestion of food, while preventing damage to the gastric and duodenal mucosa. As a result, parietal cell secretion is highly regulated through numerous mechanisms including the vagus nerve, gastrin, histamine, ghrelin, somatostatin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and other agonists and antagonists. The tight regulation of parietal cells ensures the proper secretion of HCl. The H(+)-K(+)-ATPase enzyme expressed in parietal cells regulates the exchange of cytoplasmic H(+) for extracellular K(+). The H(+) secreted into the gastric lumen by the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase combines with luminal Cl(?) to form gastric acid, HCl. Inhibition of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase is the most efficacious method of preventing harmful gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors and potassium competitive acid blockers are widely used therapeutically to inhibit acid secretion. Stimulated delivery of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase to the parietal cell apical surface requires the fusion of intracellular tubulovesicles with the overlying secretory canaliculus, a process that represents the most prominent example of apical membrane recycling. In addition to their unique ability to secrete gastric acid, parietal cells also play an important role in gastric mucosal homeostasis through the secretion of multiple growth factor molecules. The gastric parietal cell therefore plays multiple roles in gastric secretion and protection as well as coordination of physiological repair.","output":"The Physiology of the Gastric Parietal Cell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe role of children and young people (CYP) in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household and educational settings remains unclear. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of contact-tracing and population-based studies at low risk of bias. MethodsWe searched 4 electronic databases on 28 July 2021 for contact-tracing studies and population-based studies informative about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from 0-19 year olds in household or educational settings. We excluded studies at high risk of bias, including from under-ascertainment of asymptomatic infections. We undertook multilevel random effects meta-analyses of secondary attack rates (SAR: contact-tracing studies) and school infection prevalence, and used meta-regression to examine the impact of community SARS-CoV-2 incidence on school infection prevalence. Findings4529 abstracts were reviewed, resulting in 37 included studies (16 contact-tracing; 19 population studies; 2 mixed studies). The pooled relative transmissibility of CYP compared with adults was 0.92 (0.68, 1.26) in adjusted household studies. The pooled SAR from CYP was lower (p=0.002) in school studies 0.7% (0.2, 2.7) than household studies (7.6% (3.6, 15.9). There was no difference in SAR from CYP to child or adult contacts. School population studies showed some evidence of clustering in classes within schools. School infection prevalence was associated with contemporary community 14-day incidence (OR 1.003 (1.001, 1.004), p<0.001). InterpretationWe found no difference in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from CYP compared with adults within household settings. SAR were markedly lower in school compared with household settings, suggesting that household transmission is more important than school transmission in this pandemic. School infection prevalence was associated with community infection incidence, supporting hypotheses that school infections broadly reflect community infections. These findings are important for guiding policy decisions on shielding, vaccination school and operations during the pandemic.

Chief among these has been the need to rapidly adopt virtual, or telephone clinics as a means of reducing unnecessary patient exposure to hospitals and clinical care settings. We were greatly aided in our adoption of virtual clinics by our experience in the establishment and maintenance of a Clinical Nurse Specialist-led, virtual clinic for both abdominal aortic (AAA) and extra-aortic aneurysm (EAA) surveillance within our department since 2016. Patients undergoing surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) require frequent and lifelong clinical review. Previous studies have shown that post-operative surveillance in particular is critical in prolonging survival in AAA patients and in the early detection of late complications particularly following endovascular repair (EVAR). Poor compliance with EVAR surveillance has been shown to result in worse outcomes. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of a nurse-led virtual clinic programme in terms of the safe management of patients undergoing AAA surveillance in a nurse-led virtual clinic. RESULTS: Over the course of the 4-year period from 2016 to 2019, 1352 patients were enrolled in the virtual aneurysm surveillance clinic. The majority of patients each year were male, ranging from 78.2% in 2016 to 85.2% in 2017. The majority of patients encountered the service owing to pre-operative surveillance of an AAA, with this group comprising at least 65% of the total cohort of patients each year.Over the course of the 4-year period of the virtual clinic there were 1466 patient encounters. Each ambulatory day care centre (ADCC) attendance normally costs the hospital ?149. Therefore, a total saving of ?218,434 resulted from this initiative alone. No patient presented as an emergency with a ruptured aneurysm during the time period studied. CONCLUSION: Patients with AAA can be safely kept under surveillance in a nurse-led virtual clinic. Our experience with this model of care proved to be particularly advantageous during the period of the early COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Establishment of a clinical nurse specialist-led, virtual aneurysm surveillance clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jaffe and Iuli talk about social-distancing in Florida and Northern Italy Italy have the military, with their sad display of columns of trucks carrying all those coffins from Bergamo to dispatch them to the crematoria Then the military force back inside people still apparantly hanging out outside Then the governors from the different regions announced they are going to track people through their cellphones","output":"\\"I LIVE IN DYSTOPIA\\" 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper presents the findings of a systematic review performed on 115 academic papers published over a 26-year period from 1984 to 2009 and provides a content analysis of research themes and trends in China hotel research.

It is also one of a complex of pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), which affects millions of cattle annually. The objectives of this study were to identify loci and heritability estimates associated with BCoV infection and BRD in dairy calves and feedlot cattle. Dairy calves from California (n = 1,938) and New Mexico (n = 647) and feedlot cattle from Colorado (n = 915) and Washington (n = 934) were tested for the presence of BCoV when classified as BRD cases or controls following the McGuirk scoring system. Two comparisons associated with BCoV were investigated: (1) cattle positive for BCoV (BCoV(+)) were compared to cattle negative for BCoV (BCoV(?)) and (2) cattle positive for BCoV and affected with BRD (BCoV(+)BRD(+)) were compared to cattle negative for BCoV and BRD (BCoV(?)BRD(?)). The Illumina BovineHD BeadChip was used for genotyping, and genome-wide association analyses (GWAA) were performed using EMMAX (efficient mixed-model association eXpedited). The GWAA for BCoV(+) identified 51 loci (p < 1  10(?5); 24 feedlot, 16 dairy, 11 combined) associated with infection with BCoV. Three loci were associated with BCoV(+) across populations. Heritability estimates for BCoV(+) were 0.01 for dairy, 0.11 for feedlot cattle, and 0.03 for the combined population. For BCoV(+)BRD(+), 80 loci (p < 1  10(?5); 26 feedlot, 25 dairy, 29 combined) were associated including 14 loci across populations. Heritability estimates for BCoV(+)BRD(+) were 0.003 for dairy, 0.44 for feedlot cattle, and 0.07 for the combined population. Several positional candidate genes associated with BCoV and BRD in this study have been associated with other coronaviruses and respiratory infections in humans and mice. These results suggest that selection may reduce susceptibility to BCoV infection and BRD in cattle.","output":"Identifying Loci Associated With Bovine Corona Virus Infection and Bovine Respiratory Disease in Dairy and Feedlot Cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination prevents 2-3 million deaths worldwide every year.

Data was gathered via the online survey, which was promoted through online and social media platforms and outlets. Social media communication methods were used to reach the targeted population more effectively. RESULTS: A total of 1193 Irish festival attendees over the age of 18 completed an anonymous online survey. Alcohol, MDMA powder/crystals, ecstasy pills and cocaine were the highest reported drugs used by Irish festival attendees. The vast majority of participants reported polysubstance use (86.8%/n = 1036). Forty percent of participants (39.98%/n = 477) reported having had sex following the use of a drug at a festival; of these, 66% (n = 316) said that the sex was unprotected. Most participants (84.0%/n = 1003) engaged in some form of harm reduction when taking drugs at festivals. Overwhelmingly, participants reported a willingness to engage with drug-checking services.

METHODS Eyes from 14 patients who underwent 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures were studied. The 8-0 absorbable sutures were inserted into 27-gauge round needles and used to create sclerotomies at the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions under the scleral flap. The sutures were used to tie knots at the end of each haptic and guide haptic externalization through the sclerotomy. After externalization, a sufficient flange was created at the end of each haptic and fixed under the scleral flaps. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), IOL tilt and decentration, previous surgery history, and complications were determined. RESULTS Fourteen cases were analyzed. The majority of eyes exhibited an improvement in the BCVA after surgery. When comparing the last follow-up to preoperative visual acuity, the mean change in BCVA was + 26.32 letters (p = 0.011).

METHODS: We obtained eight quantitative measures from whole slide images (WSIs) from a benign breast disease (BBD) nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Studies (287 breast cancer cases and 1083 controls). Qualitative assessments of TDLU involution were available for 177 cases and 857 controls. The associations between risk factors and quantitative measures among controls were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age. The relationship between each measure and risk was evaluated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for the matching factors, BBD subtypes, parity, and menopausal status. Qualitative measures and breast cancer risk were evaluated accounting for matching factors and BBD subtypes. RESULTS: Menopausal status and parity were significantly associated with all eight measures; select TDLU measures were associated with BBD histological subtype, BMI, and birth index (p<0.05). No measure was correlated with body size at ages 5-10 years, age at menarche, age at first birth, or breastfeeding history (p>0.05).

We report a case of a 43 year old male with acute Covid-19 pneumonia necessitating veno-venous ECMO and RVAD support as bridge to pulmonary transplantation. At transplant, he had thrombus along his extra-corporeal pulmonary artery cannula necessitating percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy. Case Report The patient presented as a transfer to our institution with COVID-19 related ARDS in refractory respiratory failure with multiple bronchopleural fistulas. Shortly after admission, veno-venous ECMO was initiated and over time was fully ECMO dependent due to extensive tissue destruction with essentially no functional lung tissue. He was converted to right internal jugular-left subclavian vein ECMO-RVAD configuration while assessing for transplantation. After 135 days of support, a suitable donor was identified and was taken for bilateral lung transplantation with ECMO/RVAD support. This was complicated by a frozen chest, massive transfusion, and primary graft dysfunction necessitating postoperative maintenance of circulatory support. Intraoperatively, a large thrombus burden was found along the pulmonary artery outflow cannula. His chest was left open at that time while his graft recovered. Three days later, a percutaneous suction thrombectomy device was inserted through his right femoral vein and under TEE guidance, he underwent suction thrombectomy of the pulmonary artery cannula clot burden (Figure 1).

This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. EXPERT OPINION: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly.","output":"Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes mellitus among hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The N501Y amino acid mutation caused by a single point substitution A23063T in the spike gene of SARS-CoV2 is possessed by the three most common variants of concern - B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. A rapid screening tool using this mutation is important for surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed and validated a single nucleotide polymorphism real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using allelic discrimination of the spike gene N501Ymutation to screen for potential variants of concern and differentiate them from wild-type SARS-CoV-2. A total of 160 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 were characterized as mutant (N501Y) or wild-type by Sanger sequencing and were subsequently tested with the N501Y single nucleotide polymorphism real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Our assay compared to sequencing, the gold standard for SNP detection and lineage identification, demonstrated clinical sensitivity of 100% for all 57 specimens displaying N501Y mutant, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be typed as A23063T, including one specimen with mixed signal for wildtype and mutant. Clinical specificity was 100% in all 103 specimens typed as wild-type, with A23063 identified as wild-type by Sanger sequencing. The identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages carrying an N501Y mutation is critical for surveillance purposes. Current identification methods rely primarily on Sanger sequencing or whole genome sequencing which are time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. The assay described herein is an efficient tool for high-volume specimen screening for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and for selecting specimens for confirmatory Sanger or whole genome sequencing.","output":"Real-time RT-PCR Allelic Discrimination Assay for Detection of N501Y Mutation in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To minimize the devastating effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, scientists hastily developed a vaccine. However, the scaling up of the vaccination is likely to be hindered by the widespread social media misinformation. We, therefore, conducted a study to assess the COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans. Methods: We conducted a descriptive online cross-sectional survey using a self administered questionnaire among adults. The questionnaire assessed willingness to be vaccinated; sociodemographic characteristics, individual attitudes and perceptions, effectiveness, and safety of the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the independent factors associated with vaccine uptake. Results: We analyzed data for 1168 participants, the age range of 19 to 89 years with the majority being females (57.5%). Half (49.9%) of the participants reported that they would accept the COVID 19 vaccine. The majority were uncertain about the effectiveness of the vaccine (76.0%) and its safety (55.0%). About half lacked trust in the government s ability to ensure the availability of an effective vaccine and 61.0% mentioned that they would seek advice from a healthcare worker to vaccinate. Age 55 years and above [vs 18 to 25 years Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.04, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.07 to 3.87], chronic disease [vs no chronic disease AOR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.32 to 2.25], males [vs females AOR: 1.84, 95%CI: 1.44 to 2.36] and being a healthcare worker [vs not being a health worker AOR: 1.73, 95%CI: 1.34 to 2.24] were associated with increased likelihood to vaccinate.

Conclusion: We found half of the participants willing to vaccinate against COVID-19. The majority lacked trust in the government and were uncertain about vaccine effectiveness and safety. The policymakers should consider targeting geographical and demographic groups which were unlikely to vaccinate with vaccine information, education, and communication to improve uptake.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans: A rapid national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lentigo maligna (LM) is a common in situ melanoma subtype arising on chronically sun-damaged skin and mostly affects the head and neck region. Localisation in cosmetically sensitive areas, difficulty to obtain wide resection margins and advanced patient age/comorbidities have encouraged investigation of less invasive therapeutic strategies than surgery in managing complex cases of LM. Radiotherapy and imiquimod have emerged as alternative treatment options in this context. The treatment of LM with imiquimod cream can be challenging due to the nature of the disease including its often large size, variegated appearance, involvement of adnexal structures, poorly defined peripheral edge and frequent localisation close to sensitive structures such as the eyes and lips, and elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Prolonged and unpredictable inflammatory reaction and side effects and compliance with a patient-delivered therapy can also be challenging. In the literature to date, studies evaluating the use of imiquimod to treat LM have utilised varying methodologies and provided short follow-up and these limitations have impaired the development of clear guidelines for dosage and management of side effects. Based on our multidisciplinary experience and review of the literature, we propose practical clinical strategies for the use of imiquimod for treating LM, detailing optimal administration procedures in various clinical scenarios and long-term management, with the aim of facilitating optimal patient outcomes.","output":"A practical guide on the use of imiquimod cream to treat lentigo maligna."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The common cold is an important illness both as a result of the economic impact of this common disease and because of the morbidity associated with the complications of the illness.

Huntingtons disease (HD) is the most common genetic cause of chorea. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition. Common symptoms include oral ulcers, joint pain, malar or discoid rashes, photosensitivity, and blood dyscrasias. It can involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. SLE can cause neuropsychiatric manifestations like psychosis, seizures, headache, confusion, and stroke. Chorea is a known symptom of SLE. HD is now recognized to involve more than one system and is associated with a number of comorbid conditions. We report the first case of hereditary choreiform disorder associated with and aggravated by SLE. This is also the first case report of probable Huntington disease from Balochistan, Pakistan. We report a 19-year-old girl with choreiform disorder and a family history of chorea. Choreiform disorder was present in her paternal grandmother and uncles. She presented with fever, cough, and aggravation of choreiform movements of upper and lower limbs for 10 days. She also complained of pain in the small joints of her hands and feet, oral ulcers, hair loss, and aggravation of choreiform movements for two and half months. Probable differential diagnoses of HD, Wilsons disease, and other types of hereditary chorea, aggravated by infections, SLE, or Covid-19, were made. Her initial lab results revealed pancytopenia, increased D-dimers and serum ferritin, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). Her C(3) and C(4) complement factors were low. The rest of the lab test results, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coronavirus disease (COVID-19), blood culture, and malaria, were negative. Thus, a diagnosis of hereditary chorea associated with and aggravated by SLE was made. Hereditary choreiform disorders can be associated with and aggravated by autoimmune conditions like SLE. Thus, it is recommended to be vigilant and have a low threshold for diagnosing co-existing autoimmune conditions like SLE in patients with hereditary choreiform disorder.","output":"Hereditary Chorea Associated With and Aggravated by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, mild signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease developed in a healthy 33-year-old man in Hong Kong.

Chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-fluoracil (800 mg/m2/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin or nedaplatin (80 mg/m2/day) on day 1. The median (range) follow-up was 47 (6-127) months. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 71.2% and 60.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (91.7% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.018).

BrainDead was trained on activation data obtained from in vitro experiments on murine microglia, incorporating sequence and intra-molecular structure, as well as inter-molecular homo-dimerization potential of candidate RNAs. The method was applied to analyse all known human miRNAs regarding their potential to induce TLR7/8 signalling and microglia activation. We validated the predicted functional activity of subsets of high- and low-scoring miRNAs experimentally, of which a selection has been linked to Alzheimers disease. High agreement between predictions and experiments confirms the robustness and power of BrainDead. The results provide new insight into the mechanisms of how miRNAs act as TLR ligands.
