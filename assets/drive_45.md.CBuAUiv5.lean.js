This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients at a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared between severe and non-severe patients. Immune response phenotyping based on the late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratified patients into different disease severities and outcomes. Results: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those with low IgG levels (51.8 vs. 32.3%; p = 0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlophenotype were 72.3, 48.5, 33.3, and 15.6%, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlohad higher inflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlophenotype (p &lt; 0.05). Recovery rates for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlophenotype were 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p = 0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhiand NLRhiIgGlophenotypes. Conclusions: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on the late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","output":"Immune Phenotyping Based on the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and IgG Level Predicts Disease Severity and Outcome for Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The distinction between face-to-face and distant digitally-mediated educational engagement is a complex one, and the two modes are often combined in practice, via 'blended learning' or the use of a VLE to support campus-based teaching.

This paper explores how this predicament has brought to the fore the nature of our engagement with digital knowledge practices and screen-based communication, arguing that the notion of'virtual learning' is a flawed one.

In primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons, we showed that frataxin depletion resulted in decreased levels of the mitochondrial calcium exchanger NCLX, neurite degeneration and apoptotic cell death. Here we describe that frataxin-deficient dorsal root ganglia neurons display low levels of ferredoxin 1, a mitochondrial Fe/S cluster-containing protein that interacts with frataxin and, interestingly, is essential for the synthesis of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. We provide data that calcitriol supplementation, used at nanomolar concentrations, is able to reverse the molecular and cellular markers altered in DRG neurons. Calcitriol is able to recover both ferredoxin 1 and NCLX levels and restores mitochondrial membrane potential indicating an overall mitochondrial function improvement. Accordingly, reduction of apoptotic markers and neurite degeneration was observed and, as a result, cell survival was also recovered. All these beneficial effects would be explained by the finding that calcitriol is able to increase the mature frataxin levels in both, frataxin-deficient DRG neurons and cardiomyocytes; remarkably, this increase also occurs in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from FA patients. In conclusion, these results provide molecular bases to consider calcitriol for an easy and affordable therapeutic approach for FA patients.","output":"Calcitriol increases frataxin levels and restores mitochondrial function in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has elevated anew the import of holistically conceiving human-environmental well-being and tackling the overarching precarities of our ecologies, societies and public health in strategies of securitization. This paper considers the key challenge of reimagining securitization in the aftermath of COVID-19 and makes two core arguments. The first is that in addressing precarity a key starting point lies in being mindful of how it is differentially experienced across multiple social hierarchies in the human world. The paper draws upon Judith Butler's work on 'frames of seeing' to consider how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those who have always been precarious but not in view. The second core argument is that it is vital to move beyond a concern for human precarity to a concern for a broader sense of planetary precarity, which in turn prompts the need to strategize for a 'more-than-human' sense of security. Developing the concept of 'human security', the paper reflects on how we can usefully envision a 'more-than-human security' for a more biologically stable and sustainable planet.","output":"Planetary Precarity and 'More-Than-Human Security': The Securitization Challenge in the Aftermath of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Japanese manufacturing industry is facing a shortage of new employees and an aging workforce due to the declining birthrate and aging population. In addition, the manufacturing industry needs new employees who can learn independently and cooperatively, and possess knowledge and skills in manufacturing. Project-based learning (PBL) is a learning method that allows independent and cooperative learning. Students who learned this method at the Tokyo University of Science in 2019 formed a small group and acquired not only technical skills in the manufacturing field but also interpersonal skills through communication and discussion with group members. However, the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 made it difficult to conduct face-to-face classes, making it was necessary to conduct online classes. As such, online education has attracted attention, as its allows learners and instructors to connect via the Internet and conduct classes remotely. However, in online learning, communication among learners may be insufficient. This study aims to encouraged students to share information by providing them with different information on how to improve their assembly skills and by giving them opportunities to communicate. It specifically investigates the effect of online PBL on the development of students in the manufacturing industry and examines the effect of PBL by introducing the LEGO block assembly training. With repeated assembly trainings, students improved their LEGO assembly skills and created assembly manuals for anyone to complete the task within a standard timeframe. The results show that students who are given different information and encouraged to communicate under online PBL improve their assembly skills more effectively than other students. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Effect of division of roles on learners in online manufacturing education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and PRO measures (PROMs) are real-world evidence that can help capture patient experiences and perspectives regarding a clinical intervention such as genetic testing.

Patients with respiratory distress and suspected COVID-19 consecutively admitted in the Emergency Medicine Unit were enrolled. Lung Ultrasound examinations were performed blindly to clinical data. Outcomes were diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and in-hospital mortality. 159 patients were included in our study, 66% were males and 63.5% had a final diagnosis of COVID-19.

SARS caused the first epidemic alert at the beginning of this century, followed by MERS. COVID-19 appeared to be highly contagious, with human-to-human transmission by aerosol droplets, and reached nearly all countries around the world. A plethora of studies were performed, with reports being published within a short period of time by scientists and medical physicians. It has been difficult to find the relevant data to create an overview of the situation according to studies from accumulated findings and reports. In the present study we aimed to perform a comprehensive study in the context of the case fatality ratios (CFRs) of three major human Coronavirus outbreaks which occurred during the first twenty years of 21st century. METHODS: In this study, we performed meta-analyses on SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreak events from publicly available records. Study analyses were performed with the help of highly reputable scientific databases such as PubMed, WOS and Scopus to evaluate and present current knowledge on zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks, starting from 2000 to the end of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 250,194 research studies and records were identified with specific keywords and synonyms for the three viruses in order to cover all publications. In the end, 41 records were selected and included after applying several exclusion and inclusion criteria on identified datasets. SARS was found to have a nearly 11% case fatality ratio (CFR), which means the estimated number of deaths as a proportion of confirmed positive cases; Taiwan was the country most affected by the SARS outbreak based on the CFR analysis. MERS had CFRs of 35.8 and 26 in Saudi Arabia during the 2012 and 2015 outbreaks, respectively. COVID-19 resulted in a 2.2 CFR globally, and the USA reported the highest mortality ratio in the world in the end of first year of COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Some members of the Coronaviridae family can cause highly contagious and devastating infections among humans. Within the last two decades, the whole world has witnessed several deadly emerging infectious diseases, which are most commonly zoonotic in nature. We conclude that pre-existing immunity during the early stages of a pandemic might be important, but case control and management strategies should be improved to decrease CFRs.

Our results demonstrate that the semi-polar LEDs with the SLS pre-layer exhibit an improvement in both internal quantum efficiency and light output, which is similar to their c-plane counterparts. However, the performance improvement is not so significant as in the c-plane case. This is because the SLS pre-layer also introduces extra misfit dislocations for the semi-polar, but not the c-plane case, which act as non-radiative recombination centres.","output":"Influence of an InGaN superlattice pre-layer on the performance of semi-polar (11-22) green LEDs grown on silicon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have consistently described poor clinical outcomes and increased ICU mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require mechanical ventilation (MV).

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. RESULTS: Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range (IQR), 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p = 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001].

Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS: Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients.

Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and they were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05).

The cryo-EM structure of CV3-13 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike reveals that the antibody binds from a distinct angle of approach to an N-terminal domain (NTD) epitope that only partially overlaps with the NTD supersite recognized by neutralizing antibodies. CV3-13 does not alter the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice, but its Fc-enhanced version significantly delays virus spread, neuroinvasion and death in prophylactic settings.

Four physical performance measures (PPMs) have been recently validated for use with nonarthritic hip conditions; however, their ability to detect functional improvement and correlate with improvements in popular hip-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments after PAO is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of four PPMs up to 1 year after PAO, compare PPMs with established PRO measures at these time points, and report the acceptability and utility of PPMs for assessing outcomes after PAO. METHODS: Twenty-two participants aged 15 to 39 years completed the timed stair ascent (TSA), sit-to-stand five times (STS5), self-selected walking speed, four-square-step test, and seven hip-specific PRO measures before surgery and at approximately 6 months and 1 year after PAO. They completed questions regarding acceptability and utility of both types of testing. Wilcoxon rank sum test and unpaired Student t-tests were used to assess differences between time points; Spearman correlation and generalized linear modeling were used to determine the relationship between PPMs and PRO measures. RESULTS: Six months after PAO, participants showed significant improvements on all seven PRO instruments (P < 0.001) and on the STS5 (P = 0.01). At one year, these improvements were maintained and TSA also improved (P = 0.03). Improvement in other PPMs did not reach significance (P = 0.07 and 0.08). The STS5 test demonstrated moderate to strong correlation (|r| = 0.43 to 0.76, P < 0.05) with all PRO measures, and the TSA test demonstrated moderate to strong correlation with almost all measures (|r| = 0.43 to 0.58, P < 0.05). Correlations strengthened on subanalysis of participants with unilateral disease (n = 11) (|r| = 0.56 to 0.94, P < 0.05). All participants (100%) found PPM testing acceptable despite disability; 25% preferred PPMs to PRO measures, whereas 75% of participants found them equal in usefulness.

HCWs who were male (adjusted odds ratio(AOR) = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29C3.79), regularly using sanitizer, accessing COVID-19 management guideline (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.46C5.47), trained on COVID-19 prevention methods (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4C4.7), hopeless of eventually getting COVID-19 at workplace (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.13C3.28), and feeling unsafe at work when using standard precautions (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27C0.79) were associated with good PPE using compared to their counterparts. Moreover, nursing/midwifery professionals practiced good personal protective equipment compared to physicians (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.8C7.7). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that being a male, being a nurse/midwifery, regularly sanitizing hands/medical equipment, having COVID-19 management guidelines, trained on COVID-19, and feeling of eventually getting COVID-19 at workplace had a positive association with PPE utilization. Besides, the study revealed that not feeling safe at work when using standard precautions was negatively associated with PPE utilization of HCWs. Therefore, the prevention priorities should be given to frontline HCWs by providing all possible support and strictly implementing the prevention and control guidelines of COVID-19 to prevent the health system from collapse.","output":"Personal protective equipment utilization practice and psychological preparedness of health care workers against COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, occurring due to SARS-COV-2 infection, is the most recent pandemic disease that has led to three million deaths at the time of writing A great deal of effort has been directed towards altering the virus trajectory and/or managing the interactions of the virus with its subsequent targets in the human body;these interactions can lead to a chain reaction-like state manifested by a cytokine storm and progress to multiple organ failure During cytokine storms the ratio of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory mediators is generally increased, which contributes to the instigation of hyper-inflammation and confers advantages to the virus Because cytokine expression patterns fluctuate from one person to another and even within the same person from one time to another, we suggest a road map of COVID-19 management using an individual approach instead of focusing on the blockbuster process (one treatment for most people, if not all) Here, we highlight the biology of the virus, study the interaction between the virus and humans, and present potential pharmacological and non-pharmacological modulators that might contribute to the global war against SARS-COV-2 We suggest an algorithmic roadmap to manage COVID-19","output":"Pathogenesis and Management of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic psychology of pandemics creates an atmosphere of panic and fear that can expedite new laws and facilitate criminogenic narrative arousal Using narrative criminology, we discuss crimes that emerged from pandemic narratives in the early phases of the disease in Mexico We show how pandemic master narratives have unexpected criminogenic effects;can be negotiated to make them criminogenic;and are opposed by more fundamentally criminogenic counter-narratives We also show how pandemics repurpose justifications for traditional crimes and offer an opportunity for narrative repositioning of criminals Societal crises intensify the continuous narrative negotiation that always underlies the meaning of crime Pandemics can therefore act as a prism through which social scientists can see how crime is an ongoing narrative accomplishment ?

Fifteen participants performed four experimental sessions that consisted of the combination of two real altitude conditions [low altitude (low altitude, 690 m), high altitude (higher altitude, 2,320 m)] and two testing procedures (H-reflex and vertical jumps). Participants were tested on each testing day at 8, 11, 14 and 17 h. The only significant difference (p < 0.05) detected for the H-reflex was the higher H-reflex response (25.6%) obtained 15 min after arrival at altitude compared to baseline measurement. In terms of motor behavior, DJ height was the only variable that showed a significant interaction between altitude conditions (LA and HA) and time of measurement (8, 11, 14 and 17 h) as DJ height increased more during successive measurements at HA compared to LA. The only significant difference between the LA and HA conditions was observed for DJ height at 17 h which was higher for the HA condition (p = 0.04, ES = 0.41). Although an increased H-reflex response was detected after a brief (15-20 min) exposure to real altitude, the effect on motorneuron pool excitability could not be confirmed since no significant changes in the H-reflex were detected when comparing LA and HA.

In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear. METHODS: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds. RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6-92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9-82.7%). CONCLUSION: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10-30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results. While lowered diagnostic thresholds may result in unacceptable specificity, our findings have implications for epidemiological analyses and result interpretation in individuals with a high pre-test probability.

Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of ACE2 is further increased due to some recent reports about the varying ACE2 dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Comprehensive characterization of N- and O- glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has prompted scientists to discover a cure for the disease.

Methods: For objective 1, modified messages were piloted with mothers and postpartum healthcare providers simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 10 participants from the original development study. For objective 2, three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (<3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message with participants initiating contact. Data were collected via TextIt and REDCap. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources. Results: For objective 1, three mothers (M age=30.67 years) and seven healthcare providers (M age = 46.0 years) participated in the modification of the messages. Participants felt the messages were appropriate and relevant related to changes in postpartum care during the coronavirus pandemic. Nine messages were modified related to coronavirus and five messages were added to the program.

The study aims to collect the patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) survey of patients discharged during the COVID-19 pandemic and their family caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients aged &#8805;18 years, hospitalised between 28 February and 11 May 2020 and then discharged home, plus their family caregivers will be invited to complete a self-administrated questionnaire made up of 14 closed questions and 1 open-ended question. The questionnaire will include items on the patient's hospital trajectory and assess the interpersonal trust placed in nurses and physicians based on Krajewska-Kulak et al's Trust in Nurse Scale and Anderson et al's Trust in Physician Scale. Participants' perceived stress will be assessed using Cohen et al's Perceived Stress Scale. Feelings of safety will be examined based on Dryhurst et al's questionnaire on Risk Perception During Pandemics. After ethical clearance, data will be collected using a postal paper questionnaire and via an online web link. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be computed, and the open question will undergo a qualitative thematic analysis.

METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Centers CEA and Global Health CEA registries, containing 6907 cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and 698 cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) studies published through 2018. We examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine recommended analytic perspectives. RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile range [IQR] 2900C110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing. Of 5572 cost-per-DALY ratios, the median ICER was $US430/DALY (IQR 67C3400), and 8% were cost saving and DALY averting. Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017C2018) reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991C49,603]) was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY [IQR 10,486C77,179]). Most governmental guidelines (67%) recommended either a healthcare sector or a payer perspective.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate feedback from patients with CHF following participation in the Innovative Telemonitoring Enhanced Care program for CHF (ITEC-CHF) study. METHODS: The telemonitoring intervention consisted of three components: remote weight monitoring, structured telephone support, and nurse-led collaborative care. Participants were provided with electronic weighing scales (W550; ForaCare), and a computer tablet (Galaxy Tab A; Samsung). They were asked to weigh themselves on the provided scales daily. Telemonitoring was integrated with a personal assistance call service and a nurse care service according to their workflows in usual care. Feedback on the usability of ITEC-CHF was collected via survey from study participants following 6 months of receiving telemonitoring care for their body weight. Survey responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale and through open-ended questions to determine participants perceived benefits and barriers to using ITEC-CHF. RESULTS: A total of 67 participants (49/67, 73% male), with a mean age of 69.8 (SD 12.4) years completed the survey. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the ITEC-CHF program was easy to use (61/67, 91%), easy to navigate (51/65, 78%), useful (59/65, 91%), and made them feel more confident in managing their weight (57/67, 85%). Themes related to participants perceptions of telemonitoring included increased support for early intervention of clinical deterioration, improved compliance to daily weighing, a sense of reassurance, and improved self-care and accountability, among others. CONCLUSIONS: ITEC-CHF was rated highly on usability and was well accepted by users as part of their routine self-management activities. Participants were willing to use telemonitoring because they perceived a broad spectrum of benefits for CHF management.

The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 M around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on ?-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 19323 M), and the inhibition became weaker on ?-glucuronidase and &#945;-rhamnosidase (IC50>500 M).

However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and &#945;-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients with Covid-19.","output":"Inhibition effects of eight anti-coronavirus drugs on glycosides metabolism and glycosidases in human gut microflora"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A public health emergency of current international concern is the outbreak of a severe respiratory illness, that is, coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Thus, it is unclear whether pre-existing CVDs are independently important predictors for severe COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a nationwide Danish cohort of hospital-screened COVID-19 patients aged > =40, we investigated if pre-existing CVDs predict the 30-day risk of (1) composite outcome of severe COVID-19 and (2) all-cause mortality. We estimated 30-day risks using a Cox regression model including age, sex, each CVD comorbidity, COPD-asthma, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. To illustrate CVD comorbidities' importance, we evaluated the predicted risks of death and severe infection, for each sex, along ages 40 - 85. 4,090 COVID-19 hospital-screened patients were observed as of August 26, 2020; 22.1% had &#8805; 1 CVD, 23.7% had severe infection within 30 days and 12.6% died. Predicted risks of both outcomes at age 75 among men with single CVD comorbidities did not differ in clinically meaningful amounts compared to men with no comorbidities risks for the composite outcome of severe infection; women with heart failure (28.2%; 95% CI 21.1%-37.0%) or atrial fibrillation (30.0%; 95% CI: 24.2%-36.9%) showed modest increases compared to women with no comorbidities (24.0%; 95% CI: 21.4%-26.9%).

Most mental health-care departments appear to have set up infection control measures and also organised planning, coordination and measures that enabled them to provide psychiatric care in a restrictive environment. Our objective was to assess the organisation by psychiatric facilities in France of their response to COVID-19, during the first wave. METHODS: In June 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed by an audit with 48 items which was proposed to 331 hospitals in metropolitan France with a capacity for full-time, that is, inpatient psychiatric hospitalisation of adults. RESULTS: Of the 331 establishments contacted, 94 (28.4%) agreed to respond to the survey questionnaire. Full-time inpatient hospitalisation was completely or partially maintained by 94.7% (n = 89) of facilities. Specific measures concerning respect for patients rights were reported by 58% (n = 55) of establishments. Overall, 74.5% (n = 70) had set up a dedicated channel of care for patients at risk of severe COVID-19, and 52.1% (n = 49) a system for routine screening at admission for these risk factors.

Although the recommendation systems can find customer groups that have similar interests as target customers, brand new products often lack ratings and comments. Similarly, products that are less often purchased, such as furniture and home appliances, have fewer records of ratings; therefore, the chances of being recommended are often lower. This research attempts to analyze customers' purchasing behaviors based on product features from transaction records and product feature databases. Customers' preferences toward particular features of products are analyzed and then rules of customer interest profiles are thus drawn in order to recommend customers products that have potential attraction with customers. The advantage of this research is its ability of recommending to customers brand new products or rarely purchased products as long as they fit customer interest profiles; a deduction which traditional market basket analysis and collaborative filtering methods are unable to do. This research uses a two-stage clustering technique to find customers that have similar interests as target customers and recommend products to fit customers' potential requirements.

METHODS: This study reports the main results of a monocentric two-armed randomized-controlled rater-blind clinical trial. A total of 152 patients with MD were randomized to either CBT or HT receiving outpatient individual psychotherapy with 16 to 20 sessions for the duration of six months. The primary outcome was the mean percentage improvement in depressive symptoms assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The difference in the mean percentage symptom reduction between HT and CBT was 2.8 (95% CI=-9.85 to 15.44) in the Intention-to-treat sample and 4.0 (95% CI=-9.27 to 17.27) in the Per Protocol sample (N=134).

METHODS Two hundred ninety seven children 6 years of age, admitted to hospital in Slovenia, October 2011 to October 2012, with AGE, and 88 6 years old healthy children were included in the study. A broad spectrum of enteric pathogens was targeted with molecular methods, including 8 viruses, 6 bacteria and 2 parasites. RESULTS At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 91.2% of cases with AGE and 27.3% of controls. Viruses were the most prevalent (82.5% and 15.9%), followed by bacteria (27.3% and 10.2%) and parasites (3.0% and 1.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. A high proportion (41.8%) of mixed infections was observed in the cases.

We formalize the problem as a continual learning problem where the algorithm learns new tasks without performance degradation on the previous ones and without re-training the model from scratch. We empirically demonstrate that our method requires significantly less model parameters compared to other state of the art methods and that it is significantly faster at inference time. The tight control on the number of model parameters, and so the memory, is not only improving efficiency. It is making possible the usage of the algorithm in real-world applications where deploying a solution with a constantly increasing memory consumption is just unrealistic.

Methods A retrospective study was performed at a pandemic hospital in Istanbul, Turkey and 681 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 were included. Data on characteristics, vital signs and laboratory parameters were recorded form electronic medical records. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis to quantify the discriminatory abilities of the prognostic scales. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify other predictors of mortality. Results Higher CRP levels were associated with an increased risk for mortality (OR:1.015, 95% CI 1.008 to 1.021, p < 0.001).

Even now  a year after the pandemic announcement by WHO, there is lack of clinical evidence to confirm the efficacy of the majority of anti-COVID drugs, evenly for general and critically ill patients. Objective. To estimate the efficacy and safety of some anti-COVID-19 drugs as well as the impact of the demographic data and comorbidity on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. Materials and methods. The single-center retrospective cohort study was performed on critically ill patients admitted to the ICU of Moscow Municipal Hospital No. 68 from March 6 to June 3, 2020. Anthropometric parameters, severity of the condition and comorbidities, as well as CT data, treatment in the ICU, duration of mechanical ventilation and the patients length of staying the ICU were taken into account and analyzed. Results. Overall, 403 patients (231 male, average age: 62.4  15.3 years, range from 21 to 97 years) were enrolled into the study. In hospital mortality rate appeared to be 44.9 % (181/403) and was equal for men and for women (p = 1,000). The application of low molecular weight heparin was the single one significant predictor of mortality reduction according to the results of multivariate analysis  HR = 0.742 (0.545C0.991), p = 0.045. The main unmodifiable predictors for mortality elevation in the ICU were: age 65+ (RR 2.116 [1.680C2.664], p < 0.001) and Charlsons comorbidity index (HR 1.136 [1.087C1.188], p < 0.001). The group of patients with a fatal outcome had a higher comorbidity index, the number of points on the SOFA scale (p < 0.001), as well as a larger median number of days in the ICU (p = 0.012).

While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. METHODS: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. RESULTS: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels.

As pressures mount on healthcare systems to provide treatment to patients, mHealth is seen as one of the possible solutions to addressing these challenges. Given the sensitivity of health data, the rapid development of the mHealth sector raises privacy concerns. The aims of this research were to investigate privacy threats/concerns in the context of mHealth and the management of chronic diseases and to propose a novel privacy framework to address these concerns. Subject and method: The study adopted a modified version of the engineering design process. After defining the problem, information was gathered through literature reviews, and analyses of existing regulatory (privacy) frameworks and past research on privacy threats/concerns. Requirements for a new framework were then specified leading to its development and comparison with existing frameworks. Results: A novel future-proof privacy framework was developed and illustrated. Using existing regulatory frameworks for privacy and privacy threats/concerns from research studies, privacy principles and their resulting requirements were identified. Furthermore, mechanisms and associated technologies needed to implement the privacy principles/requirements into a functional prototype were also identified. A comparison of the proposed framework with existing frameworks, showed that it addressed privacy threats/concerns in a more comprehensive manner. Conclusion: This research makes a valuable contribution to protecting privacy in mHealth. The novel framework developed is an improvement on existing frameworks.

Thymbra is a genus of oregano commonly found in Turkey. The primary component (34.9%) of the extract obtained from Thymbra spicata L. is the carvacrol which is used in traditional medicine. This study evaluates the potential antiviral activity and inactivation efficiency of T. spicata L. extract against bovine respiratory viruses, including BCoV, BPIV-3, BRSV, BVDV and BoHV-1. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate its effect on viral replication, viral titres were taken from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic T. spicata L. extract concentrations (0.75% and 1.5%, 1.32 and 2.64 g/ml of carvacrol as active ingredient, respectively) and compared to non-treated infected cells. The viruses were treated directly with 1.5% T. spicata L. extract, and the viral titres were evaluated at certain time points to determine the efficiency of direct inactivation. The number of infectious virions for BCoV, BPIV-3, BRSV, BVDV and BoHV-1 treated with 1.5% T. spicata L. extract were decreased by 99.44%, 100.0%, 94.38%, 99.97% and 99.87%, respectively.T. spicata L. extract strongly inhibits the replication of mentioned viruses in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, T. spicata L. extract shared direct inactivation efficiency on the mentioned viruses in a time-dependent manner.

We aimed to design and conduct pilot implementations of this innovative tabletop simulation modality, which focused uniquely on everyday and everynight work, along with the factors that govern that work. In so doing, we aimed to develop a modality and preliminary findings that researchers and educators can use to simulate healthcare practices across longer episodes of care (i.e., time scales of hours or an entire day) and to detect the latent social threats that can emerge during interprofessional clinical care. An interprofessional team designed tabletop simulation scenarios of interprofessional challenges during transfers of care on a labour and delivery (L&D) unit. Within each scenario, participants provided real-time explanations for their work and associated drivers, both independently and as a team. Thus, we combined think-aloud and simulation principles to design tabletop simulation scenarios to elicit healthcare professionals descriptions of how they collaborate in their work on the L&D unit. We completed a total of five tabletop simulations with eight participants (obstetricians, N = 2; midwives, N = 2; nurses, N = 5). The conversations stimulated by the tabletop simulation scenarios and debriefs allowed us to generate a preliminary understanding of the texts that govern and organize clinicians everyday work processes. We generated data about longitudinal, multi-hour work processes in a condensed timeline, with opportunities to pause and probe, and with reduced focus on individual practitioners competence. We believe our innovative tabletop simulation approach allowed us to examine clinical work in ways no other simulation permits. Participants described how the scenarios opened a productive dialogue between professional groups and suggested this simulation-based approach might contribute to enhanced interprofessional understanding and cultural change. We suggest that others can adapt our low-resource approach to understand clinicians everyday work and to map how this work is governed by documents, like policies, with the end goal of facilitating system change and managing latent social threats.

In some countries, like Belgium, more than half of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected deaths occurring in spring 2020 concerned residents of care homes. The high incidence in this population is certainly linked to its peculiar age structure but could also result from its poorer general health condition and/or from a higher contamination through the staff of care homes, while protection equipment and testing capacity were initially limited. To address these issues, we used data from Wallonia (Belgium) to characterize the distribution of death rates among care home institutions, to compare the dynamics of deaths in and outside care homes, and to analyse how age and sex affected COVID-19 death rates inside and outside care homes. We also used annual death rates as a proxy for the health condition of each population. We found that: (1) COVID-19 death rate per institution varied widely from 0{per thousand} to 340{per thousand} (mean 43{per thousand}) and increased both with the size of the institution (number of beds) and with the importance of medical care provided. (2) 65% of COVID-19 deaths in Wallonia concerned residents of care homes where the outbreak started after but at a faster pace than the outbreak seen in the external population. (3) The impact of age on both annual and COVID-19 mortality closely follows exponential laws (i.e. Gompertz law) but mortality was much higher for the population living in care homes where the age effect was lower (mortality rate doubling every 20 years of age increment in care homes, 6 years outside them). (4) Both within and outside care homes, the ratio of M/F death rates was 1.6 for annual mortality but reached 2.0 for COVID-19 mortality, a ratio consistent among both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths. (5) When reported to the annual death rate per sex and age, the COVID-19 relative mortality was little affected by age and reached 24% (M) and 18% (F) of their respective annual rate in nursing homes, while these percentages reduced to 10% (M) and 9% (F) in homes for elderly people (with less medical assistance), and to 5% (M) and 4% (F) outside of care homes. In conclusion, a c. 130x higher COVID-19 mortality rate found in care homes compared to the outside population can be attributed to the near multiplicative combination of: (1) a 11x higher mortality due to the old age of its residents, (2) a 3.8x higher mortality due to the low average health condition of its residents, and (3) probably a 3.5x higher infection rate (1.6x in homes for elderly people) due to the transmission by its staff, a problem more acute in large institutions. Our results highlight that nursing home residents should be treated as a very specific population, both for epidemiological studies and to take preventive measures, due to their extreme vulnerability to COVID-19.","output":"A world apart: levels and factors of excess mortality due to COVID-19 in care homes.

Theory predicts a group-structured population with selection acting principally at two levels: the pathogen individuals and the group of pathogens within a single host individual. Rapid replication of individual viruses is selected for, but if this replication debilitates the host before transmission occurs, the entire group of viruses in that host may perish. Thus, rapid transmission can favor more pathogenic strains, while slower transmission can favor less pathogenic strains. Available data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may follow this pattern. Indeed, high population density and other circumstances that favor rapid transmission may also favor more deadly strains. Health care workers, exposed to pathogenic strains of hospitalized patients, may be at greater risk. The low case fatality rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may reflect the founder effect-an initial infection with a mild strain. A vaccine made with one strain may confer limited immunity to other strains. Variation among strains may lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to therapeutics.

The review was aimed to serve as a quick reference for addressing practical issues faced during patient care in the ongoing pandemic with a brief account of management of COVID-19 patients as per international guidelines. Expert Opinion: As more evidence continues to generate regarding the optimal methods of managing COVID-19 cases while caring for non-COVID patients concurrently, physicians will need to rapidly re-educate themselves to keep pace with a rapidly evolving landscape of therapeutic options.","output":"Management of COVID-19 from the pulmonologist's perspective: a narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection with possible serious consequences. The plasma of recovered patients might serve as treatment, which we aim to assess in the form of a prospective meta-analysis focusing on mortality, multi-organ failure, duration of intensive care unit stay, and adverse events. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to find relevant registered randomized controlled trials in five trial registries. A comprehensive search will be done continuously on a monthly basis in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science to find the results of previously registered randomized controlled trials. The selection will be done by two independent authors. Data extraction will be carried out by two other independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by a third investigator. An update of the search of the registries and the first search of the databases will be done on the 21st of July. Data synthesis will be performed following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. In the case of dichotomous outcomes (mortality and organ failure), we will calculate pooled risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from two-by-two tables (treatment Y/N, outcome Y/N). Data from models with multivariate adjustment (hazard ratios, odds ratio, risk ratio) will be preferred for the analysis. P less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. In the case of ICU stay, weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Heterogeneity will be tested with I(2), and (2) tests. Meta-analysis will be performed if at least 3 studies report on the same outcome and population.

To balance these competing demands, policymakers need analytical tools to assess the costs and benefits of different mobility reduction measures. In this paper, we present our work motivated by our interactions with the Virginia Department of Health on a decision-support tool that utilizes large-scale data and epidemiological modeling to quantify the impact of changes in mobility on infection rates. Our model captures the spread of COVID-19 by using a fine-grained, dynamic mobility network that encodes the hourly movements of people from neighborhoods to individual places, with over 3 billion hourly edges. By perturbing the mobility network, we can simulate a wide variety of reopening plans and forecast their impact in terms of new infections and the loss in visits per sector. To deploy this model in practice, we built a robust computational infrastructure to support running millions of model realizations, and we worked with policymakers to develop an interactive dashboard that communicates our model's predictions for thousands of potential policies. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Supporting COVID-19 Policy Response with Large-scale Mobility-based Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or Wegener granulomatosis, is a rare systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ.

It was the first comprehensive exhibition focusing on the relationship of urbanization and cultural landscape in the Pearl River Delta and presented on an international platform. Since the open-door policy in 1979, the Pearl River Delta played a pioneering role in China's economic reform and urbanization throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This was resulted with unprecedent transformation of the cityscape and inhabitants' lifestyle. More importantly, it defined the artistic context and character of the southern region uniquely from other parts of China, providing an opportunity for an alternative narrative in the discourse of contemporary Chinese art. Taking Canton Express as a case to reflect the uncanny observations and immediate responses among the fourteen participating artists and collectives on the new reality brought by urbanization and economic development which may, however, conflicted with the socialist-communist political ideology. And such tension nevertheless triggered a collective consciousness in the artistic community and their traits of flexibility, openness and self-autonomy to seek for an artistic identity independent from the existing narrative of contemporary Chinese art legitimized by the officials for biennales held inside and outside China.

Despite the evolving conceptualization of AIRP for general populations of older adults, considerations of AIRP relevant for older people with previous or current experiences of homelessness are absent from the existing literature. Given this conceptual gap, we developed a framework of indicators relevant for older persons experiencing homelessness. We engaged community partners in the development of our framework and examined what had been described in prior research on aging in place and person-environment fit for older adults. The resulting conceptual framework is comprised of six sub-categories of indicators: 1) Built environment of the housing unit and surrounding neighborhood; 2) Offsite and onsite health and social services and resources; 3) Social integration; 4) Stability and affordability of place; 5) Emotional place attachment; and 6) Broader political and economic contexts.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the safety of HCQ in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were retrieved starting from the establishment of the database till June 5, 2020. Literature screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk bias were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 53 eligible studies involving 5496 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that the risk of adverse effects (AEs) in the HCQ group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (RD 0.05, 95%CI, 0.02 to 0.07, P = 0.0002), and the difference was also statistically significant in the COVID-19 subgroup (RD 0.15, 95%CI, 0.07 to 0.23, P = 0.0002) as well as in the subgroup for other diseases (RD 0.03, 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.04, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ is associated with a high total risk of AEs compared with the placebo or no intervention in the overall population.

On the other hand, the onset of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) shows insidious progression, and the prognosis varies significantly. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the renal outcome in MN, using only the severity of proteinuria. Fractional excretion of total protein (FETP), which was protein clearance divided by creatinine clearance (Ccr), may be a better indicator of protein leak per functioning nephron. A recent study has also reported that FETP accurately predicted transplant failure and was more sensitive and specific than protein creatine ratio (PCR). Few studies, however, have analyzed the FETP to evaluate their relationship with renal function and histologic lesions in glomerular diseases. Thus, this study aims to assess the relationship between FETP and the clinicopathological findings and whether FETP predicts outcome in iMN. METHOD: This study included patients with iMN that underwent kidney biopsies during the period from 2002 to 2020. We analyzed 24-h urinary protein excretion, FETP, and other clinicopathological findings at the kidney biopsy. The FETP was determined by the standard clearance technique based on 24-h urine collection: FETP = (urinary total protein / serum total protein) / (urinary creatinine / serum creatinine)  100. A 30% decrease in eGFR or the occurrence of ESRD were the endpoints. The multivariate factors affecting the prognosis were analyzed with the Cox proportional-hazards model, and the cumulative risk of risk factors was analyzed by Kaplan?Meier curve. RESULTS: A total of 153 subjects with MN were identified and were followed up for a median of 5.4 years. (age 64.913.6 [mean  SD] years, male 73.2 %, hypertension 42.5 %, diabetes 10.5 %, nephrotic Syndrome 67.3 %, chronic kidney disease [CKD: eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m(2)] 51.9 %, eGFR 61.622.6 mL/min/1.73m(2), urinary protein excretion [u-TP] 4.33.6 g/day, PCR 5.44.5 g/gCr, FETP 0.120.18 %, Selectivity Index [S.I] 0.230.39, fractional excretion of IgG [FEIgG] 0.0650.170 %, glomerulosclerosis [GS] 13.913.7 %, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [IFTA] 12.210.0 %). FETP was more significantly associated with clinical parameters than PCR and FEIgG (Table.1). The high FETP group had a significantly worse renal prognosis during the follow-up periods than the low FETP group (Figure.1). Using Cox proportional hazards models, with FETP entered, and age, sex, eGFR,u-TP as covariates, FETP predict the primary endpoint with a hazards ratio of 0.343 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FETP would be superior to PCR, the standard measure of proteinuria, in predicting outcome in patients with iMN.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) is a commonly used MRD detection method. However, FCM MRD detection is not well standardized, and the interpretation is subjective. There are normal/reactive minor cell populations in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), which could be confused with MRD. METHODS The FCM data of 231 BM and 44 PB pediatric samples performed in a recent 15-month period were retrospectively reviewed. These samples were from 56 B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, 11 T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, 28 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 44 cytopenia/leukocytosis patients, and five patients with mycosis fungoides. RESULTS There were over 10 normal or reactive minor cell populations identified with certain phenotypes mimicking MRD of acute leukemia. These mimickers included CD19+ NK cells, CD22+ basophils, CD22+ dendritic cells (DCs), and plasma cells for B-ALL MRD; CD4/8 double-negative T cells, CD4/8 double-positive T cells, cytoplasmic CD3+ NK cells, CD2- T cells, CD7- T cells, CD5- gamma delta T cells, CD56+ NKT cells for T-ALL MRD; CD33+ NK cells, CD117+ NK cells, basophils, plasmacytoid DCs, non-classical monocytes, CD56+ and/or CD61+ monocytes for AML MRD.

METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine.

Globally, surface monitoring is limited due to cost and infrastructure demands. While remote sensing can help estimate respirable (i.e. ground level) concentrations, current observations are restricted by inadequate spatiotemporal resolution, uncertainty in aerosol type, particle size, and vertical profile. One key issue with current remote sensing datasets is that they are derived from reflectances observed by polar-orbiting imagers, which means that aerosol is only derived during the daytime and only once or twice per day. Newer quantification methods using geostationary infrared (IR) data have focussed on detecting the presence, or absence, of an event. The determination of aerosol composition or particle size using IR exclusively has received little attention. This manuscript summarizes four scientific papers, published as part of a larger study, and identifies requirements for (a) using infrared radiance observations to obtain continual (i.e. day and night) concentration estimates; (b) increasing temporal resolution by using geostationary satellites; (c) utilizing all infrared channels to maximize spectral differences due to compositional changes; and (d) applying a high-pass filter (brightness temperature differences) to identify compositional variability. Additionally, (e) a preliminary calibration methodology was tested against three severe air quality case study incidents, namely, a dust storm, smoke from prescribed burns, and an ozone smog incident, near Sydney in eastern Australia which highlighted the ability of the method to determine atmospheric stability, clouds, and particle size. Geostationary remote sensing provides near-continuous data at a temporal resolution comparable to monitoring equipment. The spatial resolution (~ 4 km(2) at NADIR) is adequate for large sources but coarse for localized sources. The spectral sensitivity of aerosol is limited and appears to be dominated by humidity changes rather than concentration or compositional changes. Geostationary remote sensing can be used to determine the timing, duration, and spatial extent of an air quality event. Brightness temperature differences can assist in qualifying composition with an order of magnitude estimate of concentration.","output":"Using infrared geostationary remote sensing to determine particulate matter ground-level composition and concentration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organism-inspired hollow structure attracts increasing interest to construct various bionic functional hollow materials.

The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well-organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in aqueous NaOH solution. The self-evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen-bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time.

Altered anatomy can complicate treatment of underlying cancer. We first present a rare case of cervical cancer with invasion of uterovaginal prolapse as well as a systematic review of similar reported cases in the literature. The objective of this study was to compare the practice patterns and outcomes regarding cervical cancer with invasion of procidentia. Methods We conducted a systematic search of online databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Library) from 1990 to 2018 of all the cases of cervical cancer associated with stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse. Patient demographics, pathology, surgical management, chemotherapy, radiation and disease-free survival were compared. Results Fifteen reported cases of cervical cancer in the setting of procidentia were identified (squamous cell carcinoma-14, clear cell carcinoma-1). The mean age at diagnosis was 74 years (range 54-89). Thirteen percent (n = 2) of cases presented with FIGO stage I disease, 67% (n = 10) with stage II, and 20% (n = 3) with stage III. All cases had stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse. 73% (11) were treated surgically including nine patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. Among patients who underwent primary surgery, 7% (1) received adjuvant chemotherapy, 33% (5) adjuvant radiotherapy and 21% (3) both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. 33% (5) of surgical cases included procedures to address the pelvic organ prolapse (colpoclesis (n = 3), uterosacral suspension (n = 1) and anterior posterior repair (n = 1)). Two patients died from the disease within 12 months, one patient died from other causes within 1 month, and the remainder of patients were free of disease at last reported follow-up (Table 1). Conclusions Cervical cancer in the setting of stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse can be managed successfully with standard treatment strategies (primary surgery with adjuvant therapy as necessary versus chemoradiation). When patients are surgical candidates, techniques to address the underlying prolapse can be used for symptomatic improvement.","output":"Cervical carcinoma in the setting of uterovaginal prolapse: comparing standard versus tailored management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heavy pollution in North China has attracted extensive attention in recent decades, and numerous studies have been conducted in developed regions, while studies on the heavily polluted Fenwei Plain in Northwest China are still scarce. In this study, we analyzed the continuous air pollution records of Weinan city on the Fenwei Plain from 2016 to 2020 to provide specific prevention and control strategies for the region. From 2016 to 2020, pollutant concentrations showed an overall decreasing trend, with a slight increase in O3 concentration. The study found that during the COVID-19 lockdown period, O3 was also significantly affected by the lockdown policy. During the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, anthropogenic emissions were reduced due to restraints on commercial and social activities. NO2 responds sensitively during COVID-19, and PM2.5 has a delayed response. We applied pathway analysis to investigate the contribution of different pollutants and meteorology to PM2.5. The results show that CO and NO2 have the largest positive comprehensive effect, while wind speed and temperature have the largest negative comprehensive effect. Spearman's correlation analysis shows that NO2 contributes significantly to O3 production in different AQI ranges.

This article describes how our clinic implemented an automated software solution for this purpose into an established software platform in 10 days. The underlying hypothesis was that modern academic centers in radiology are capable of developing and implementing such tools by their own efforts and fast enough to meet the rapidly increasing clinical needs in the wake of a pandemic. METHOD: Deep convolutional neural network algorithms for lung segmentation and opacity quantification on chest CTs were trained using semi-automatically and manually created ground-truth (Ntotala?=a?172). The performance of the in-house method was compared to an externally developed algorithm on a separate test subset (Na?=a?66). RESULTS: The final algorithm was available at day 10 and achieved human-like performance (Dice coefficienta?=a?0.97). For opacity quantification, a slight underestimation was seen both for the in-house (1.8 %) and for the external algorithm (0.9 %). In contrast to the external reference, the underestimation for the in-house algorithm showed no dependency on total opacity load, making it more suitable for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of machine learning and a clinically embedded software development platform enabled time-efficient development, instant deployment, and rapid adoption in clinical routine. The algorithm for fully automated lung segmentation and opacity quantification that we developed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was ready for clinical use within just 10 days and achieved human-level performance even in complex cases.","output":"Development and clinical implementation of tailored image analysis tools for COVID-19 in the midst of the pandemic: The synergetic effect of an open, clinically embedded software development platform and machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to investigate the prognostic performances of oxidative stress (OS), inflammatory and cell activation biomarkers measured at admission in COVID-19 patients. Design: retrospective monocentric study. Setting: patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) admitted to the hospital. Patients: One hundred and sixty documented and unselected COVID-19-patients. Disease severity (from mild to critical) was scored according to NIHs classification. Interventions: none. Measurements and main results: We measured OS biomarkers (thiol, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), ischemia-modified albumin (IMA)), inflammation biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), presepsin) and cellular activation biomarkers (calprotectin) in plasma at admission. Thiol concentrations decreased while IMA, IL-6, calprotectin and PSEP increased with disease severity in COVID-19 patients and were associated with increased O(2) needs and ICU admission. The best area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) for the prediction of ICU admission was for thiol (AUC = 0.762). A thiol concentration <154 mol/L was predictive for ICU admission (79.7% sensitivity, 64.6% specificity, 58.8% positive predictive value, 78.9% negative predictive value). In a stepwise logistic regression, we found that being overweight, having dyspnoea, and thiol and IL-6 plasmatic concentrations were independently associated with ICU admission. In contrast, calprotectin was the best biomarker to predict mortality (AUC = 0.792), with an optimal threshold at 24.1 mg/L (94.1% sensitivity, 64.9% specificity, 97.1% positive predictive value and 98.9% negative predictive value), and survival curves indicated that high IL-6 and calprotectin concentrations were associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.

Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19Crelated discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, coronavirus, COVID-19, quarantine) from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included virus, lockdown, and quarantine. Popular bigrams included COVID-19, stay home, corona virus, social distancing, and new cases. We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning.

Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2; also known as CD317 or tetherin) was initially identified to be a pre-B-cell growth promoter, but it also inhibits the release of virions of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by tethering budding virions to the host cell membrane. Further work has shown that BST-2 restricts the release of many other viruses, including the human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E), and the genomes of many of these viruses encode BST-2 antagonists to overcome BST-2 restriction. Given the previous studies on BST-2, we aimed to determine if BST-2 has the ability to restrict SARS-CoV and if the SARS-CoV genome encodes any proteins that modulate BST-2's antiviral function. Through an in vitro screen, we identified four potential BST-2 modulators encoded by the SARS-CoV genome: the papain-like protease (PLPro), nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), ORF6, and ORF7a. As the function of ORF7a in SARS-CoV replication was previously unknown, we focused our study on ORF7a. We found that BST-2 does restrict SARS-CoV, but the loss of ORF7a leads to a much greater restriction, confirming the role of ORF7a as an inhibitor of BST-2. We further characterized the mechanism of BST-2 inhibition by ORF7a and found that ORF7a localization changes when BST-2 is overexpressed and ORF7a binds directly to BST-2. Finally, we also show that SARS-CoV ORF7a blocks the restriction activity of BST-2 by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic sources in 2002 and caused over 8,000 infections and 800 deaths in 37 countries around the world. Identifying host factors that regulate SARS-CoV pathogenesis is critical to understanding how this lethal virus causes disease. We have found that BST-2 is capable of restricting SARS-CoV release from cells; however, we also identified a SARS-CoV protein that inhibits BST-2 function. We show that the SARS-CoV protein ORF7a inhibits BST-2 glycosylation, leading to a loss of BST-2's antiviral function.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ORF7a Inhibits Bone Marrow Stromal Antigen 2 Virion Tethering through a Novel Mechanism of Glycosylation Interference."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19, enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depletes ACE2, which is necessary for bradykinin metabolism. The depletion of ACE2 results in the accumulation of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and possible bradykinin, both of which bind to bradykinin receptors and induce vasodilation, lung injury and inflammation. It is well known that an overactivated contact system and excessive production of bradykinin comprise the key mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is reasonable to speculate that COVID-19 may increase disease activity in patients with HAE and vice versa. In this review, we explore the potential interactions between COVID-19 and HAE in terms of the contact system, the complement system, cytokine release, increased T helper 17 cells, and hematologic abnormalities. We conclude with the hypothesis that comorbidity with HAE might favor COVID-19 progression and may worsen its outcomes, while COVID-19 might in turn aggravate pre-existing HAE and prompt the onset of HAE in asymptomatic carriers of HAE-related mutations. Based on the pathophysiologic links, we suggest that long-term prophylaxis should be considered in patients with HAE at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor and lanadelumab and that HAE patients must have medications for acute attacks of angioedema. Additionally, therapeutic strategies employed in HAE should be considered for the treatment of COVID-19, and clinical trials should be performed.","output":"Does hereditary angioedema make COVID-19 worse?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health interventions implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are based on experience gained from past pandemics.

The overall incidence rates of newly registered cases per week for the 9 greater regions of Bern for both the first and second waves of the pandemic were calculated. Relative incidence rate ratios (RIRRs) were calculated to estimate the change in the slope of incidence curves associated with public health interventions.

During the second wave, in autumn 1918, cantonal authorities initially reacted hesitantly and delegated the responsibility to enact interventions to municipal authorities, which was associated with a lack of containment of the second wave. A premature relaxation of restrictions on mass gatherings was associated with a resurgence of the epidemic (RIRR, 1.18 [CI, 1.12 to 1.25]).

In developing countries such as Kenya, the citizens are now required to wear facemasks when in public places such as markets, streets, shopping malls, etc. With limited supply of the proper facemasks in the developing countries, the public is left to improvise them from the available resources. Alternatively, they purchase substandard facemasks from uncertified suppliers and sellers. The purchased masks do not meet the required health standards in most cases.

Using self-determination theory (SDT), this research explored psychological need satisfaction, frustration, and behavioural regulation to explain indicators of self-management. Design and Main Outcome Measures: Cross-sectional, questionnaire-based methods in people on a pulmonary rehabilitation waiting-list. 72 participants completed SDT, HRQoL, and self-management knowledge questionnaires. Path analyses investigated the ability of SDT concepts to predict self-management knowledge and HRQoL. Results: Chi-square tests found no significant differences ((2)(13, N=72) = 16.7, p > 0.05) between the just C and over-identified models, and multiple measures suggested an acceptable fit to the data. Relatedness frustration positively predicted controlled regulation and autonomy and relatedness satisfaction positively predicted autonomous regulation. The associations between the other needs and the different regulation types were not statistically significant. Both regulation types strongly predicted HRQoL (35% variance explained) and self-management knowledge (22% variance explained). Conclusion: SDT concepts can predict more self-determined self-management regulation, self-management knowledge, and HRQoL and provide a framework for researchers and healthcare professionals to develop future health interventions for people with COPD.

Herein, we aim to describe the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on heart failure (HF) admissions. In this retrospective cohort study, we obtained administrative data for patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF (identified by ICD-10 code) with discharge dates ranging from January 2019 to November 2020. The study is comprised of 2 distinct sub-cohorts: HF admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic (case) period from March 2020 to October 2020 and corresponding control period during the previous year (March 2019 to December 2019). Primary outcome analysis involved comparison of total and daily HF admissions and secondary outcomes included hospital Length of Stay (LOS) and 30-day readmissions. The number of total HF admissions and average daily admissions were significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019 (774 vs. 864; p < 0.001 and 3.17 vs. 3.53 days; p < 0.001), respectively.

In this study, a pilot scale biomass fired rotary drum dryer was developed for drying turmeric rhizomes. The drying experiments were conducted at 50, 60, and 70 degrees C air temperatures at an air velocity of 2 and 3 m/s and the drum speeds of 6 and 9 rpm. The turmeric rhizomes dried at a faster rate at the operating conditions of 70 degrees C air temperature, 3 m/s air velocity and 9 rpm drum rotational speed. Among the evaluated thin layer drying models, Page model comparatively gave higher R-2 values (0.998), lower sum of square error (0.001), and root mean square error (0.01) values. The effective moisture diffusivity of turmeric in the rotary dryer ranged from 0.33 to 0.5 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1). The calculated activation energy of turmeric rhizomes was 19,338 kJ/kg mol(-1). The higher curcumin, oleoresin, starch, and color values such as lightness, redness, and yellowness value of 4.92%, 16.5%, 58.09%, and 59.87, 28.43, and 74.21, respectively, was observed at 50 degrees C, 9 rpm drum rotational speed and 3 m/s air velocity. The results indicated that the color of turmeric could be retained by drying at 50 degrees C. Practical Applications The present scenario, turmeric has been considered as an important crop against COVID-19 due to its antiviral properties and also food applications such as natural coloring agent and flavor enhancer. The unit operations involved in turmeric processing is washing, boiling, drying, polishing, and size reduction. The amount of curcumin content presents in turmeric decides its value. Drying is the time-consuming process compared to other unit operations and has an impact over the quality parameters of turmeric. Sun drying is the main traditional drying method normally practiced by the farmers for bulk drying of turmeric rhizomes. However, the sun-dried turmeric rhizomes lost its product value because of poor quality end product (dark yellowish brown color). This could be due to longer exposure of the product in sun causes change in the volatiles and color in turn degrades the market value and fetches lower price to the farmer. And also decreased drying rate, prolonged drying time, non-uniformity, and lesser energy consumption are the other factors that degrades further the quality of the product. Hence, a drying technology should be identified to overcome the problems faced by the farmers and also to dry the bulk capacities of the turmeric rhizomes at low cost. Rotary dryers are capable of processing larger capacities of various agricultural products having wide range of thermophysical and aerodynamic properties. The current research focused on developing a rotary dryer to reduce the drying time and also to retain the quality that benefits both farmers and industries by providing good quality product.","output":"Design, development, and evaluation of rotary drum dryer for turmeric rhizomes (Curcuma longa L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is an urgent need of a new generation of vaccine that are able to enhance protection against SARS-CoV-2 and related variants of concern (VOC) and emerging coronaviruses.

There remains limited information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of pediatric patients affected by COVID-19, particularly in the pulmonary sub-population. OBJECTIVE: Describe the clinical course of pediatric pulmonary patients with COVID-19 throughout the initial wave of infection at a single pediatric center. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 1,350 patients,  35 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and August 31, 2020. Patients followed by our pulmonary group, and evaluated at least once in the three years preceding study completion, were identified for additional chart review. Demographics, pulmonary diagnoses, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, clinical course and management were collected for analysis. RESULTS: 70 pulmonary patients (mean age 8.3 years, range 8 months to 23 years;45% male;44% Black of African American;29% Hispanic or Latino) were identified from 1,350 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal PCR testing through our hospital system. Most frequently reported symptoms were fever (49%), cough (49%), and nasal congestion (29%). Thirteen patients (19%, mean age 9.2 years, range 12 months to 18 years) required inpatient treatment for symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, one asymptomatic patient tested positive while admitted. Most common pulmonary diagnoses of those requiring admission were asthma (57%), prematurity (29%), sleepdisordered breathing (29%), and respiratory disorders with positive pressure requirement (29%). For those requiring inpatient care, extra-pulmonary co-morbidities included chronic neurological disorders (71%), gastrointestinal disease (43%), and allergic rhinitis (36%). Disease severity was defined as asymptomatic (17%), mild (67%), moderate (6%), severe (6%), or critical (3%). Mild disease was defined as cases managed outpatient or those admitted for observation and supportive care;moderate as those admitted for medical intervention or respiratory support via supplemental oxygen or high-flow nasal cannula;severe as those who received noninvasive ventilation or an increase in baseline respiratory support;critical were patients who received mechanical ventilation. Inpatient complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 included superinfection, thrombosis, refractory hypoxemia and tracheostomy placement. Seven experienced complications and required intensive care unit services;two required tracheostomy. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Patients followed by our pediatric pulmonary group presented with similar symptoms compared to the general pediatric population. The majority of our patients were managed outpatient, however the rate of hospitalization was higher than those of the general pediatric population in existing studies. Of those admitted, few required invasive mechanical ventilation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients with pulmonary disorders: A single center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Polymicrobial diseases, caused by combinations of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, are being recognised with increasing frequency.

Strep pneumoniae carriage protected against Staph aureus carriage, and the bacterial interference could be disrupted by vaccinating children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type Strep pneumoniae.

Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins.

Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.","output":"Unraveling the structural complexity in a single-stranded RNA tail: implications for efficient ligand binding in the prequeuosine riboswitch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder, which brings an enormous financial burden to the medical system. However, the current treatment options for pneumonia are limited because of drug resistance and side effects. Our previous study preliminarily confirmed that Yinlai Decoction (YD), a common prescription for pneumonia in clinical practice, can regulate the expression of inflammatory factors, but the mechanisms are unknown yet. METHODS: In our work, a method named network pharmacology was applied, which investigated the underlying mechanisms of herbs based on a variety of databases. We obtained bioactive ingredients of YD on TCMSP database and collected potential targets of these ingredients by target fishing. Then the pneumonia-related targets database was built by TTD, Drugbank, HPO, OMIM, and CTD. Based on the matching targets between YD and pneumonia, the PPI network was built by STRING to analyze the interactions among these targets and then input into Cytoscape for further topological analysis. DAVID and KEGG were utilized for GO and pathway enrichment analysis. Then rat model based on LPS stimulated pneumonia was used to verify the possible mechanism of YD in treating pneumonia. RESULTS: Sixty-eight active ingredients, 103 potential targets and 8 related pathways, which likely exert a number of effects, were identified. Three networks were constructed using Cytoscape, which were herb-component-network, YD-pneumonia target network, and herb-component-YD target-pneumonia network. YD was verified to treat LPS-induced pneumonia by regulating the inflammatory factor IL-6, which was a predicted target. CONCLUSION: Network analysis indicated that YD could alleviate the symptoms and signs of pneumonia through regulating host immune inflammatory response, angiogenesis and vascular permeability, the barrier function of the airway epithelial cells, hormone releasing and cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.","output":"Network pharmacology to dissect the mechanisms of Yinlai Decoction for pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the first link in the chain of providing healthcare services in the frontline of the battle against COVID-19, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are faced with various challenges, which affect their professional performance.

Here, we report a case of an acute T lymphoblastic leukemia patient with mixed infections of lethal invasive Mucormycosis and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. After receiving anti-infection drugs to control the patient's fever, he was treated with induction chemotherapy. However, the malignant hematological disease was poorly controlled by the chemotherapy and the patient developed more symptoms of infection. Although the results of multiple ?-D-Glucan (G) and Galactomannan (GM) tests remained negative, several pathogens were detected using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). In particular, mNGS identified Malassezia pachydermum, Mucor racemosus, and Lauteria mirabilis in the peripheral blood and local secretion samples. The Mucor and bacterial infections were further confirmed via multi-site and repeated fungal and bacterial cultures, respectively. Despite adjusting the anti-infection therapy according to the diagnostic results, the patient's blood disease and symptoms of infection were not alleviated. Additionally, the MDR Acinetobacter baumannii infection/colonization was not confirmed until the seventh culture of the peripheral venous catheter tip. Due to the patient's deteriorating conditions, his family decided to withdraw him from further treatment. Overall, mNGS can facilitate a diagnosis of Mucormycosis by providing clinical and therapeutic information to support conventional diagnostic approaches.

This technology allows researchers to investigate and examine types of diseases and their origins. However, microarray data are often associated with a small sample size, a significant number of genes, imbalanced data, etc., making classification models inefficient. Thus, a new hybrid solution based on a multi-filter and adaptive chaotic multi-objective forest optimization algorithm (AC-MOFOA) is presented to solve the gene selection problem and construct the Ensemble Classifier. In the proposed solution, a multi-filter model (i.e., ensemble filter) is proposed as preprocessing step to reduce the dataset's dimensions, using a combination of five filter methods to remove redundant and irrelevant genes. Accordingly, the results of the five filter methods are combined using a voting-based function. Additionally, the results of the proposed multi-filter indicate that it has good capability in reducing the gene subset size and selecting relevant genes. Then, an AC-MOFOA based on the concepts of non-dominated sorting, crowding distance, chaos theory, and adaptive operators is presented. AC-MOFOA as a wrapper method aimed at reducing dataset dimensions, optimizing KELM, and increasing the accuracy of the classification, simultaneously. Next, in this method, an ensemble classifier model is presented using AC-MOFOA results to classify microarray data. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on nine public microarray datasets, and its results were compared in terms of the number of selected genes, classification efficiency, execution time, time complexity, hypervolume indicator, and spacing metric with five hybrid multi-objective methods, and three hybrid single-objective methods. According to the results, the proposed hybrid method could increase the accuracy of the KELM in most datasets by reducing the dataset's dimensions and achieve similar or superior performance compared to other multi-objective methods. Furthermore, the proposed Ensemble Classifier model could provide better classification accuracy and generalizability in the seven of nine microarray datasets compared to conventional ensemble methods. Moreover, the comparison results of the Ensemble Classifier model with three state-of-the-art ensemble generation methods indicate its competitive performance in which the proposed ensemble model achieved better results in the five of nine datasets.

METHODS: We assessed peripheral blood gene expression in 53 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection clinically adjudicated as having mild, moderate or severe disease. Supervised principal components analysis was used to build a weighted gene expression risk score (WGERS) to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in participants with mild and moderate illness were similar, but significantly different from severe illness. When comparing severe versus non-severe illness, we identified >4000 genes differentially expressed (FDR<0.05). Biological pathways increased in severe COVID-19 were associated with platelet activation and coagulation, and those significantly decreased with T cell signaling and differentiation. A WGERS based on 18 genes distinguished severe illness in our training cohort (cross-validated ROC-AUC=0.98), and need for intensive care in an independent cohort (ROC-AUC=0.85). Dichotomizing the WGERS yielded 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity for classifying severe illness in our training cohort, and 84% sensitivity and 74% specificity for defining the need for intensive care in the validation cohort.

This study aims to investigate the characteristics of the isolated or quarantined children and adolescents followed by the Public Health Department of the Italian province of Modena during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: The study population included all non-adult subjects aged 0-18 years who underwent isolation or quarantine during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from February 24 to June 18, 2020 in Modena province, Northern Italy. RESULTS: In Modena province, 1230 children and adolescents were isolated in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6.3%), or quarantined due to close contact with confirmed cases (88.7%) or travelling from a high-risk area (5.0%). Among 349 individuals who underwent swab testing, 294 (84.2%) reported close contact with an infected cohabiting relative and 158 (45.3%) were symptomatic.

METHODS: An electronic survey including closed and open-ended questions was distributed to physical therapists employed in a range of health care settings across the United States. RESULTS: Physical therapy use and process of care varied across settings. Feasibility of performing an assessment was the main driver for selection of outcome measures. Interventions were mainly geared toward improving respiratory function and deconditioning. Prone patient positioning, now commonplace, was used infrequently by therapists in acute care prior to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Similarly, outpatient and home care settings noted an increase in the use of respiratory-driven interventions such as incentive spirometry and breathing exercises. Qualitative data analysis revealed both physical barriers (personal protective equipment [PPE]) and social barriers to care. Therapists noted challenges in discharge planning and patient/family education due to the impact of social isolation. They also noted difficulty maintaining productivity standards because of additional time spent in changing PPE and following safety measures. Participants dealt with rapid changes in their role, changing productivity standards, and needing to increase their knowledge in a short amount of time. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy use varied widely across settings. Despite some concern for personal health, respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic increased a sense of togetherness among team members and promoted greater appreciation for life and work. IMPACT: This exploration of the process of care and current clinical practices across settings provides important knowledge about the role of physical therapists and physical therapist assistants in the care of patients with COVID-19.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to tissues. 4-methylumbilliferon (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis, is used to treat inflammation, but its mechanism of action is unknown. We studied the effect of 4-MU on neutrophil adhesion and concomitant secretion using adhesion to fibronectin as a model for integrin-dependent adhesion. 4-MU reduced the spreading of neutrophils on the substrate and the concomitant secretion of granule proteins, including pro-inflammatory components. 4-MU also selectively blocked adhesion-induced release of the free amino acid hydroxylysine, a product of lysyl hydroxylase, which can influence cell invasion by modifying the extracellular matrix. Finally, 4-MU inhibited the formation of cytonemes, the extracellular membrane secretory structures containing the pro-inflammatory bactericides of the primary granules. The anti-inflammatory effect of 4-MU may be associated with the suppression of secretory processes that ensure the neutrophil invasion and initiate inflammation. We suggest that HA, due to the peculiarities of its synthesis, can promote the release of secretory carriers from the cell and 4-MU can block this process.","output":"Inhibitor of Hyaluronic Acid Synthesis 4-Methylumbelliferone Suppresses the Secretory Processes That Ensure the Invasion of Neutrophils into Tissues and Induce Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decades, great interest has been given to biomimetic nanoparticles (BNPs) since the rise of targeted drug delivery systems and biomimetic nanotechnology.

While there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for these symptoms, off-label use of medications such as antipsychotics have been shown to have significant adverse effects including increased mortality. The goal of this review is to examine the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of BPSD. METHODS We will systematically search for randomized trials of anticonvulsants compared to placebo or other treatments such as antidepressants and antipsychotics from the following sources: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID SP) in Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (latest version), EMBASE, clinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry. The studies will be limited to those published in English but the study location can be worldwide. We will include studies pertaining to individuals with dementia and symptoms of BPSD. The primary outcomes will be behavioral change as measured by validated scales and secondary outcomes will include caregiver burden, quality of life, placement in long term care facility, serious adverse effects, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Two sets of reviewers will independently screen select and extract data. We will narratively describe the major findings and conclusions from individual studies. Patients who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for other indications, including seizures, will be excluded. Outcomes of interest will include a change in a validated scale that measures BPSD, serious adverse events, and caregiver quality of life outcomes. If the data are found to be appropriate for a meta-analysis, we will use a random effects model to compute summary estimates of treatment effects. DISCUSSION This is a protocol for a systematic review addressing the anticonvulsant group of medications as a whole, and as such, our results will inform current clinical practice in the use of anticonvulsants for BPSD. It will also help clinicians and policy makers compare the efficacy of anticonvulsants compared to antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as identify areas which will need further study.

Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. Lay Summary: The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients.

Effective assessment is important throughout training so that identified areas of strength and weakness can guide educational planning to optimize outcomes. Assessment has historically been underemphasized although medical education oversight organizations have strengthened requirements in recent years. Growing acceptance of competency-based medical education and its logical extension to competency-based time-variable (CB-TV) graduate medical education (GME) further highlights the importance of implementing effective evidence-based approaches to assessment. The Clinical Competency Committee (CCC) has emerged as a key programmatic structure in graduate medical education. In the context of launching a multi-specialty pilot of CB-TV GME in our health system, we have examined several programs CCC processes and reviewed the relevant literature to propose enhancements to CCCs. We recommend that all CCCs fulfill three core goals, regularly applied to every GME trainee: (1) discern and describe the residents developmental status to individualize education, (2) determine readiness for unsupervised practice, and (3) foster self-assessment ability. We integrate the literature and observations from GME program CCCs in our institutions to evaluate how current CCC processes support or undermine these goals. Obstacles and key enablers are identified. Finally, we recommend ways to achieve the stated goals, including the following: (1) assess and promote the development of competency in all trainees, not just outliers, through a shared model of assessment and competency-based advancement; (2) strengthen CCC assessment processes to determine trainee readiness for independent practice; and (3) promote trainee reflection and informed self-assessment. The importance of coaching for competency, robust workplace-based assessments, feedback, and co-production of individualized learning plans are emphasized.

Precipitation was the strongest predictor of species presence. Habitat suitability maps illustrate potential corridors for gene flow between the southern and northern populations, although much of this area is inhabited by L. l. tschudii. An analysis of the current protected area (PA) network showed 47% of remaining suitable habitat is unprotected.

The VEEV nsP2 protease is a member of MEROPS Clan CN and characteristically contains a papain-like protease linked to an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase (SAM MTase) domain. The protease contains an alternative active site motif, (475)NVCWAK(480), which differs from papain's (CGS(25)CWAFS), and the enzyme lacks a transition state-stabilizing residue homologous to Gln-19 in papain. To understand the roles of conserved residues in catalysis, we determined the structure of the free enzyme and the first structure of an inhibitor-bound alphaviral protease. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found to bind beneath a -hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains. His-546 adopted a conformation that differed from that found in the free enzyme; one or both of the conformers may assist in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, E64c (200 M), the carboxylic acid form of the E64d ester, did not inhibit the nsP2 protease. To identify key residues involved in substrate binding, a number of mutants were analyzed. Mutation of the motif residue, N475A, led to a 24-fold reduction in kcat/Km, and the conformation of this residue did not change after inhibition. N475 forms a hydrogen bond with R662 in the SAM MTase domain, and the R662A and R662K mutations both led to 16-fold decreases in kcat/Km. N475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product release. An Asn homologous to N475 is similarly found in coronaviral papain-like proteases (PLpro) of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. Mutation of another motif residue, K480A, led to a 9-fold decrease in kcat and kcat/Km. K480 likely enhances the nucleophilicity of the Cys. Consistent with our substrate-bound models, the SAM MTase domain K706A mutation increased Km 4.5-fold to 500 M. Within the -hairpin, the N545A mutation slightly but not significantly increased kcat and Km.

During the pandemic, certain healthcare related activities such as seeing or contacting a practitioner to receive a prescription refill may have been a challenge for some patients that could have interfered in the patients medication adherence and continuity of care. Given these circumstances, the pandemic also shed light on the necessity for pharmacists to dispense emergency refills, which often is based on variable state pharmacy laws and regulations. State pharmacy laws and regulations vary from allowing pharmacists to dispense as much medication that is required for the patient to receive a new prescription to emergency refills being allowed only in the direst situations to save a patients life. State pharmacy laws and regulations vary in the allowable quantities that may be dispensed, the federal schedule of controlled substance medications, and the circumstances they can be dispensed. In many cases, COVID-19 emergency regulations, governor executive orders and board of pharmacy guidance have expanded the authority for a pharmacist to dispense emergency refills. However, these allowances are often finite in nature and would end when the pandemic state of emergency ends.

Upon recognition of viral RNA, they interact with MAVS, eventually inducing type I interferon production. The interferon induction pathway is commonly targeted by viruses. How enteroviruses suppress interferon production is incompletely understood. MDA5 has been suggested to undergo caspase- and proteasome-mediated degradation during poliovirus infection. Additionally, MAVS is reported to be cleaved during infection with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) by the CVB3 proteinase 3C(pro), whereas MAVS cleavage by enterovirus 71 has been attributed to 2A(pro). As yet, a detailed examination of the RLR pathway as a whole during any enterovirus infection is lacking. We performed a comprehensive analysis of crucial factors of the RLR pathway, including MDA5, RIG-I, LGP2, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3, during infection of CVB3, a human enterovirus B (HEV-B) species member. We show that CVB3 inhibits the RLR pathway upstream of TBK1 activation, as demonstrated by limited phosphorylation of TBK1 and a lack of IRF3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that MDA5, MAVS, and RIG-I all undergo proteolytic degradation in CVB3-infected cells through a caspase- and proteasome-independent manner. We convincingly show that MDA5 and MAVS cleavages are both mediated by CVB3 2A(pro), while RIG-I is cleaved by 3C(pro). Moreover, we show that proteinases 2A(pro) and 3C(pro) of poliovirus (HEV-C) and enterovirus 71 (HEV-A) exert the same functions. This study identifies a critical role of 2A(pro) by cleaving MDA5 and MAVS and shows that enteroviruses use a common strategy to counteract the interferon response in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Human enteroviruses (HEVs) are important pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in humans, including poliomyelitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, viral meningitis, cardiomyopathy, and more. Like many other viruses, enteroviruses target the host immune pathways to gain replication advantage. The MDA5/MAVS pathway is responsible for recognizing enterovirus infections in the host cell and leads to expression of type I interferons (IFN-I), crucial antiviral signaling molecules. Here we show that three species of HEVs all employ the viral proteinase 2A (2A(pro)) to proteolytically target MDA5 and MAVS, leading to an efficient blockade upstream of IFN-I transcription. These observations suggest that MDA5/MAVS antagonization is an evolutionarily conserved and beneficial mechanism of enteroviruses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus immune evasion strategies will help to develop countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in the future.","output":"Enterovirus 2Apro targets MDA5 and MAVS in infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-like particles (VLPs) have received considerable attention due to their potential application in veterinary vaccines and, in particular, VLPs from rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) have successfully shown to be good platforms for inducing immune responses against an inserted foreign epitope in mice.

For this purpose, we have generated chimeric VLPs containing a well-known T epitope of 3A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Firstly, RHDV-VLPs were able to activate immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro. Secondly, pigs were inoculated twice in a two-week interval with chimeric RHDV-VLPs at different doses intranasally or intramuscularly. One intramuscularly treated group was also inoculated with adjuvant Montanide? ISA 206 at the same time. Specific IgG and IgA antibodies against RHDV-VLPs were induced and such levels were higher in the adjuvanted group compared with other groups.

Training on public health emergencies was not significantly associated with behavior change (B = -0.01 and -0.11). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a considerable psychological impact on dental academics. There was a direct, dose-dependent association between change in behaviors and worries but no association between these changes and training on public health emergencies. More change in behaviors was associated with lower country COVID-19 fatality rates.

To date, few studies have described vascular access device use and VTE risk in this cohort. To examine the use of vascular access devices and incidence of VTE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We performed a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who received a midline catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICCs), tunneled or non-tunneled central venous catheter (CVC), hemodialysis (HD) catheter or a port during hospitalization. Mixed-effects multivariable logit models adjusting for VTE risk factors in the Caprini risk score were fit to understand the incremental risk of VTE in patients with vascular access devices vs. those that did not receive devices. Management of VTE was determined by examining anticoagulant use pre- vs. post-thrombosis. Results were expressed using odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 1228 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 40 hospitals, of which 261 (21.3%) received at least one vascular access device of interest, were included. The prevalence of acute, non-tunneled CVCs was 42.2%, acute HD catheters 18.4%, midline catheters 15.6%, PICCs 15.6%, tunneled CVCs 6.8%, and implanted ports 1.4%. The prevalence of VTE was 6.0% in the study cohort, and 10.0% among patients with vascular access devices. After adjusting for known VTE risk factors, patients that had a vascular access device placed were observed to have a four-fold greater odds of VTE than those that did not (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.33C7.46). Patients who received multiple different catheters experienced more VTE events compared with patients that received only one type (21.5% vs. 6.1%, p < .001). Among the 26 patients with VTE, only 8 (30.8%) survived to discharge and among these, only 5 were discharged on therapeutic doses of anticoagulation.

Since age, gender, strain differences, and genotypes impact on the development of autoimmunity, we investigated the behavior of male and female Wistar and Lewis rat strains in two age cohorts (<6 weeks and >12 weeks) under normal husbandry conditions and following exposure to group A streptococcus (GAS). Methods: Standard behavioral assessments were performed to determine the impairments in fine motor control (food manipulation test), gait and balance (beam walking test), and obsessive-compulsive behavior (grooming and marble burying tests). Furthermore, electrocardiography, histology, and behavioral assessments were performed on male and female Lewis rats injected with GAS antigens. Results: For control Lewis rats there were no significant age and gender dependent differences in marble burying, food manipulation, beam walking and grooming behaviors. In contrast significant age-dependent differences were observed in Wistar rats in all the behavioral tests except for food manipulation. Therefore, Lewis rats were selected for further experiments to determine the effect of GAS. After exposure to GAS, Lewis rats demonstrated neurobehavioral abnormalities and cardiac pathology akin to SC and ARF/RHD, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential are incompletely defined. METHODS: We explored the underlying biology in myeloid cells from healthy volunteers following in vivo placebo or NR administration and subsequently tested the findings in vitro in monocytes extracted from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RESULTS: RNA-Seq of unstimulated and LPS-activated monocytes implicated NR in the regulation of autophagy and type I IFN signaling. In primary monocytes, NR blunted LPS-induced IFN- production, and genetic or pharmacological disruption of autophagy phenocopied this effect. Given that NAD(+) is a coenzyme in oxidoreductive reactions, metabolomics was performed and identified that NR increased the inosine level. Inosine supplementation similarly blunted autophagy and IFN- release. Finally, because SLE exhibits type I IFN dysregulation, we assessed the NR effect on monocytes from patients with SLE and found that NR reduced autophagy and IFN- release. CONCLUSION: We conclude that NR, in an NAD(+)-dependent manner and in part via inosine signaling, mediated suppression of autophagy and attenuated type I IFN in myeloid cells, and we identified NR as a potential adjunct for SLE management.

During the medical consultation, when the parents complained about the mask (64.3%), the main drawbacks were related to fog on glasses (reported by 68.2% of pediatricians), breathing discomfort (53.1% of pediatricians), cutaneous disorders (42.4% of pediatricians) and headaches (38.2% of pediatricians). Conclusion: Despite the many inconveniences reported, children agree to wear the mask better than their parents think. Pediatricians should sufficiently take the opportunity during the consultation to further explain the reasons for wearing the mask because their pedagogical role is crucial.","output":"Face Masks in Young Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Parents' and Pediatricians' Point of View"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 represents an unprecedented threat to human health worldwide.

The confinement of the population and the rising epidemic has disrupted the routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telehealth is a growing field, and its application in palliative care is seen as a solution to serve the population in this difficult crisis. METHODOLOGY: A exploratory survey was designed to assess the changes in the hospital-based practice of palliative care in the COVID-19 pandemic and patient/caregiver's perception about the provision of telehealth services to palliative care patients of a tertiary care cancer hospital of eastern India. RESULTS: There was a dramatic reduction in the outpatient clinic footfalls by 51% with teleconsultation. Although there was no change in the number of emergency visits, the inpatient admissions reduced by 44%. Nearly 82% of patient/caregivers gave a positive feedback about telemedicine care provided by the department and mentioned that the service provided them with support and connectedness. Almost 64% of the patients and caregivers reported that the service helped allay the fear and reassured them that there was a someone to support them. As high as 76% of the participants felt that they would prefer teleconsultation in future and were ready to pay for teleconsultations if charges were to be applied in the future. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is an important tool and an essential service to care for palliative care patients in the community especially when the patient and health-care professionals are separated by a pandemic or natural disaster.","output":"Patients/Caregivers Perspectives on Telemedicine Service for Advanced Cancer Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in access to healthcare and mental health, often forcing healthcare social workers into ethical and moral dilemmas as they endeavor to provide equitable, humanistic care to their patients and caregivers.

Participants were recruited through healthcare social work professional organizations from September-November 2020. Participants (N = 246) completed an online survey capturing sociodemographic variables, as well as mental distress, pandemic-related meaning-making, and resilience. Data analysis included correlations and regressions pertaining to meaning-making, emotional distress, and resilience, as well as thematic analysis of participants' open-ended survey responses. Approximately one-third of participants reported emotional distress and difficulty in finding meaning from their pandemic-related losses. Participants reported a lower level of resilience when compared with the United States general population. Three themes emerged from social workers' qualitative responses: the hardest year of my career; the collective loss of our normal; and we were built for this.

Clearance guidelines have been proposed, but expected time to clearance has not been established. METHODS: We identified all patients at a tertiary care hospital cancer center between 25 March 2020 and 6 June 2020 with a positive nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a cancer-related visit within 3 years, and at least one follow-up assay. We determined the time to clearance using American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK-NICE), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. A matched non-cancer comparison cohort was also identified. RESULTS: Thirty-two cancer patients were identified. Nineteen were cleared by ASCO criteria, with estimated median time to clearance of 50 days. Fourteen patients resumed chemotherapy prior to clearance. Using UK-NICE criteria, median time to clearance would have been 31 days, and using CDC criteria, it would have been 13 days. The matched non-cancer cohort had similar clearance time, but with less frequent testing. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 clearance times differ substantially depending on the criteria used and may be prolonged in cancer patients.

Two end-to-end portfolio constructions are included: a model-free network and a model-based network. The model-free approach is seen as a black-box, whereas in the model-based approach, we learn the optimal risk contribution on the assets and solve the allocation with an implicit optimization layer embedded in the neural network. The model-based end-to-end framework provides robust performance in the out-of-sample (2017-2021) tests when maximizing Sharpe ratio is used as the training objective function, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.16 when nominal risk parity yields 0.79 and equal-weight fix-mix yields 0.83. Noticing that risk-based portfolios can be sensitive to the underlying asset universe, we develop an asset selection mechanism embedded in the neural network with stochastic gates, in order to prevent the portfolio being hurt by the low-volatility assets with low returns.

The medical community still faces many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges vis--vis coronavirus disease 2019. Ultimately, coronavirus disease 2019 is diagnosed on the basis of laboratory and radiological findings. Considering the high rate of mortality due to coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, it is important to pay attention to the differential diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 and other diseases following thrombotic events. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 56-year-old Iranian man who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral valve repair. During hospitalization, the patient showed an elevated level of anticardiolipin antibody (immunoglobulin G isotype), antiphospholipid antibodies, and thrombosis in the brachial artery of the left hand, based on which a differential diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was made. However, ultimately, the coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction test and computed tomography scan of the lungs showed that the patient had coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSION: According to the few studies performed on coronavirus disease 2019 patients, elevated levels of the isotypes of antiphospholipid antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 patients create conditions similar to antiphospholipid syndrome, which, in the absence of reliable coronavirus disease 2019 testing, can lead to misdiagnosis and consequently delayed or improper treatment. Therefore, to provide timely and appropriate treatment, it is important to pay attention to differential diagnosis.","output":"Coronavirus-disease-2019-induced antiphospholipid-like syndrome: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a systemic maternal syndrome affecting 2-8% of pregnancies worldwide and involving poor placental perfusion and impaired blood supply to the foetus.

Identifying biomarkers that predict PE onset prior to its establishment would critically help treatment and attenuate outcome severity. MicroRNAs are ubiquitous gene expression modulators found in blood and tissues. Trophoblast cell surface antigen (Trop)-2 promotes cell growth and is involved in several cancers. We assessed the PE predictive ability of maternal miR-125b in the first trimester of pregnancy by measuring its plasma levels in women with normal pregnancies and with pregnancies complicated by PE on the 12th week of gestation. To gain insight into PE pathogenesis we investigated whether Trop-2 is targeted by miR-125b in placental tissue. Data analysis demonstrated a significant association between plasma miR-125b levels and PE, which together with maternal body mass index before pregnancy provided a predictive model with an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.00). We also found that Trop-2 is a target of miR-125b in placental cells; its localization in the basal part of the syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane suggests a role for it in the early onset of PE. Altogether, maternal miR-125b proved a promising early biomarker of PE, suggesting that it may be involved in placental development through its action on Trop-2 well before the clinical manifestations of PE.","output":"Pre-eclampsia predictive ability of maternal miR-125b: a clinical and experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged, highly transmissible, and pathogenic coronavirus that has created global public health and economic crisis. Since December 2019, when Covid-19 emerged in Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, South China, and rapidly spread throughout the world, the virus outbreak has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). This research included several parameters (Vit-D, IL-6, and D-Dimer) to evaluate the association between these biomarkers and outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, to guide potential COVID-19 Diagnosis, Treatments, and Prevention of COVID-19 disease. Aim of the study: 1. To determine if there is an association between the status of vitamin D level in blood and the severity of COVID19 disease. 2. To determine the association between vit-D level and (IL-6, and D-Dimer) levels in serum and their effect on these markers in the hospitalized COVID19 disease. 3. to evaluate the association between (IL-6, and D-Dimer) and the severity of COVID19 disease. Methods: A Cross-sectional study consisted of 40 patients with age range (18-90 years) that collected from ICU (hospitalized patients) in (West Irbil Governmental Hospital and Lalaf Governmental Hospital) in Erbil city/ Iraq, at admission to the hospital, and 40 patients with age range (18-90 year)there were non-hospitalized patients from the same place in Erbil city/ Iraq, from December 2020 to April 2021. Serum(Vit-D, and IL-6), and plasma D-Dimer concentrations were measured, firstly to comparing them with (age, gender, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection) to demonstrate the association of them with the severity of COVID-19 disease, and secondly to compered them with vit-D and demonstrate the effect of this vitamin on these parameters. Results: In the present study, the data showed A significant decrease in Vit-D concentration in sera of patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in both groups, which determines the strong correlation in (two-tailed) between vit-D concentration and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection P-value (0.00001), as while as, there is a statistical correlation between the severity of COVID-19 disease and D-Dimer in both groups P-value (6.2E-9). while statistically non-significant relation between the severity of COVID-19 disease in both groups and age P-value (0.79), also non-significant relation between vit-D and age p-value (0.08), and Non-significant correlation between gender and the severity of COVID-19 disease in both groups P-value (0.82). In both groups, there is a significant negative correlation between vitamin-D and D-dimer concentrations in H group correlation P-value (0.0001), in the non-H group P-value(0.025).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 322 healthy adults between February 2010 and November 2011 in Christchurch, New Zealand. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive an initial dose of 200,000 IU oral vitamin D3, then 200,000 IU 1 month later, then 100,000 IU monthly (n = 161), or placebo administered in an identical dosing regimen (n = 161), for a total of 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was number of URTI episodes. Secondary end points were duration of URTI episodes, severity of URTI episodes, and number of days of missed work due to URTI episodes. RESULTS The mean baseline 25-OHD level of participants was 29 (SD, 9) ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in an increase in serum 25-OHD levels that was maintained at greater than 48 ng/mL throughout the study. There were 593 URTI episodes in the vitamin D group and 611 in the placebo group, with no statistically significant differences in the number of URTIs per participant (mean, 3.7 per person in the vitamin D group and 3.8 per person in the placebo group; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85-1.11), number of days of missed work as a result of URTIs (mean, 0.76 days in each group; risk ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81-1.30), duration of symptoms per episode (mean, 12 days in each group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.25), or severity of URTI episodes.

The proposed stapling instrument is intended to simplify and optimize the current procedure of mechanical stapling, while providing controllable operation for the powered stapling procedure, such as conditioning the tissue to the right stage before firing of the stapler. MATERIAL AND METHODS The feasibility and efficacy of the prototype were assessed by ex vivo experiments with porcine small intestine segments, where the tissue conditioning operation, burst pressure of the stapled intestine samples, and staple malformation rate were examined. RESULTS The functionality of the developed powered stapler was validated, where the theoretical, numerical, and experimental results agree well with each other. The preliminary results indicated that the proposed tissue conditioning operation could lower the clamping pressure with a maximum level of 1.35 g/mm2. The average burst pressure of the stapled segments (16 samples) is 6.37 kPa, and the maximum malformation rate of the tested groups (five groups, each group with 90 staplers) was 5.56%.

Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID-19, but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors. There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age-structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that capture these changes. Here, we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS), which collected detailed contact data between March 22, 2020 and February 15, 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic. We find steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time, as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts. We also find that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups. The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period. To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns, we simulate COVID-19 dynamics in each DMA using an age-structured mechanistic model.

We find that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time-varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates.

METHODS: In a large refugee facility, we retested individuals with a previous positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and their quarantined close contacts. All individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 s) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800? system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Of 76 individuals, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 of 76 (17%) infections, but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections, which often have a more severe clinical course. The mechanisms underlying post-viral bacterial infections are complex, and include multifactorial processes mediated by interactions between viruses, bacteria, and the host immune system. Studies over the past 15 years have demonstrated that unique microbial communities reside on the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract, which have both direct and indirect effects on host defense against viral infections. In addition, antiviral immune responses induced by acute respiratory infections such as influenza are associated with changes in microbial composition and function (dysbiosis) in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, which in turn may alter subsequent immune function against secondary bacterial infection or alter the dynamics of inter-microbial interactions, thereby enhancing the proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacterial species.

A study showed that the microscopic tumour extension (ME) of NSCLC varied according to the histological type, which allowed us to deduce adapted margins for the clinical target volume (CTV). However, to date, no study has been able to define the most relevant margins for patients with stage 1 tumours. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis including patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of localised stage T1N0 or T2aN0 who underwent surgery. The ME was measured from this boundary. The profile of the type of tumour spread was also evaluated. RESULTS: The margin required to cover the ME of a localised NSCLC with a 95% probability is 4.4 mm and 2.9 mm for SCC and ADC, respectively. A significant difference in the maximum distance of the ME between the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), 0-10% and 50-90% (p < 0.05), was noted for SCC. There was a significant difference in the maximum ME distance based on whether the patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.011) for ADC. Multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between the maximum microextension distance and size with the shrinkage coefficient. CONCLUSION: This study definitively demonstrated that the ME depends on the pathology subtype of NSCLC. According to International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) reports, 50, 62 and 83 CTV margins, proposed by these results, should be added to the GTV (Gross tumour volume).

One technique described in the literature deploys a Neuroform stent into the neck of the aneurysm in the shape of a waffle-cone, thereby acting as a scaffold for the coil mass. This case series presents four patients with large wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms treated with the closed-cell Enterprise stent using the waffle-cone technique. CASE DESCRIPTION Four patients (59  18 years of age) with large wide-necked arterial bifurcation aneurysms (three basilar apex and one MCA bifurcation) were treated with the waffle-cone technique using the Enterprise stent as a supporting device for stent-assisted coil embolization. Three of the patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt-Hess 2-3; Fisher Grade 3-4). There was no procedural morbidity or mortality associated with treatment itself. One aneurysm was completely obliterated, and three had small residual necks. One patient developed an area of PCA infarct and visual field cut one month after the procedure and required recoiling of the residual neck. The flared ends of the Enterprise stent remodeled the aneurysm neck by conforming to the shape of the neck without any technical difficulty, resulting in a stable scaffold holding the coils into the aneurysm. CONCLUSION The closed cell construction, flexibility, and flared ends of the Enterprise stent allow it to conform to the waffle-cone configuration and provide a stable scaffold for coil embolization of large wide-necked arterial bifurcation aneurysms. We have had excellent initial results using the Enterprise stent with the waffle-cone technique. However, this technique is higher risk than standard treatment methods and therefore should be reserved for large wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms where Y stenting is needed, but not possible, and surgical clip ligation is not an option.","output":"Enterprise stent for waffle-cone stent-assisted coil embolization of large wide-necked arterial bifurcation aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In patients with chronic pancreatitis, laser lithotripsy (LL) permits stone fragmentation and removal during ERCP with some advantages over extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and surgery.

Net clinical impact was defined as the combination of these 2 end points. RESULTS: In 11 016 patients (5523 ticagrelor-aspirin and 5493 aspirin), a major ischemic event occurred in 294 patients (5.3%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and in 359 patients (6.5%) in the aspirin group (absolute risk reduction 1.19% [95% CI, 0.31%C2.07%]). Major hemorrhage occurred in 22 patients (0.4%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 6 patients (0.1%) in the aspirin group (absolute risk increase 0.29% [95% CI, 0.10%C0.48%]). Net clinical impact favored ticagrelor-aspirin (absolute risk reduction 0.97% [95% CI, 0.08%C1.87%]). Findings were similar when different thresholds for disability were applied and over a range of predefined subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild-moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, ischemic benefits of 30-day treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin outweigh risks of hemorrhage.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the evidence regarding the association of cholesterol parameters (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels) and glaucoma. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched for all publications containing 'glaucoma' and one of various forms of 'cholesterol' or 'lipoprotein'. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and potentially full texts of identified articles for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to investigate the differences in total cholesterol, LDL and HDL levels between patients with and without glaucoma. RESULTS Overall, 29 observational studies were included in the systematic review and 26 reported quantitative information to investigate differences in cholesterol parameters between patients with glaucoma (N = 7196) and patients without glaucoma (N = 350 441). Patients with glaucoma had significantly higher total cholesterol levels than patients without glaucoma (Mean Difference (MD) 7.9 mg/dl, 95% CI 3.3 to 12.5, p = 0.001) and lower mean HDL levels (MD -2.0 mg/dl, 95% CI: -3.1 to -0.9, p = 0.001). Patients with glaucoma had higher mean LDL levels than patients without glaucoma, albeit not statistically significant (MD 6.1 mg/dl, 95% CI: -4.3 to 16.4, p = 0.251). CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies found an association of glaucoma and high total cholesterol and low HDL levels, respectively. Although this supports the hypothesis that lipid levels pose an additional risk for glaucoma development, heterogeneity was substantial and causality cannot be presumed from identified observational studies.","output":"Cholesterol and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Las infecciones respiratorias son una de las principales causas de mortalidad y hospitalizacin en personas ingresadas en residencies de ancianos.

Abstract Respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of mortality and hospitalization in nursing home residents. As a result, interest has increased in the epidemiology of these infections. However, several issues remain to be systematically evaluated due to the lack of clinical trials. Few studies have compared different antibiotic treatment strategies and outcomes. Nursing home residents with pneumonia are frequently hospitalized and these transfers are associated with the multiple hazards of hospitalization as well as with economic costs. Several predictive models have been developed to help clinicians identify residents at low and high risk of mortality.

In this technological era, the rapid growth of coronavirus has affected the countries in lightspeed manner. Therefore, the present study proposes a model to analyse the resource allocation for the COVID-19 pandemic from a pluralistic perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The present study has combined data analytics with the K-mean clustering and probability queueing theory (PQT) and analysed the evolution of COVID-19 all over the world from the data obtained from public repositories. By using K-mean clustering, partitioning of patients records along with their status of hospitalization can be mapped and clustered. After K-mean analysis, cluster functions are trained and modelled along with eigen vectors and eigen functions. Findings: After successful iterative training, the model is programmed using R functions and given as input to Bayesian filter for predictive model analysis. Through the proposed model, disposal rate;PPE (personal protective equipment) utilization and recycle rate for different countries were calculated. Research limitations/implications: Using probabilistic queueing theory and clustering, the study was able to predict the resource allocation for patients. Also, the study has tried to model the failure quotient ratio upon unsuccessful delivery rate in crisis condition. Practical implications: The study has gathered epidemiological and clinical data from various government websites and research laboratories. Using these data, the study has identified the COVID-19 impact in various countries. Further, effective decision-making for resource allocation in pluralistic setting has being evaluated for the practitioner's reference. Originality/value: Further, the proposed model is a two-stage approach for vulnerability mapping in a pandemic situation in a healthcare setting for resource allocation and utilization. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Managing the resource allocation for the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare institutions: a pluralistic perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unwillingness of the health care system of different countries to counteract the spread of the COVID-19 virus in 2020 caused the introduction of quarantine restrictions by many countries, which had both positive and negative socioeconomic consequences.

Endogenous biomolecule zinc plays a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we found that currents recorded from heterologously expressed ASIC1a/3 channels using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique were regulated by zinc with dual effects. Co-application of zinc dose-dependently potentiated both peak amplitude and the sustained component of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 currents; pretreatment with zinc between 3 to 100 M exerted the same potentiation as co-application. However, pretreatment with zinc induced a significant inhibition of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels when zinc concentrations were over 250 M. The potentiation of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc was pH dependent, as zinc shifted the pH dependence of ASIC1a/3 currents from a pH50 of 6.54 to 6.77; whereas the inhibition of ASIC1a/3 currents by zinc was also pH dependent. Furthermore, we systematically mutated histidine residues in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a or ASIC3 and found that histidine residues 72 and 73 in both ASIC1a and ASIC3, and histidine residue 83 in the ASIC3 were responsible for bidirectional effects on heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc.

Moreover, evidence suggests that some areas are more exposed than others to contagion risk due to heterogeneous local characteristics. We study whether Italys regional policies, introduced on 4th November 2020, have effectively tackled the local infection risk arising from such heterogeneity. Methods: Italy consists of 19 regions (and 2 autonomous provinces), further divided into 107 provinces. We collect 35 province-specific pre-covid variables related to demographics, geography, economic activity, and mobility. First, we test whether their within-region variation explains the covid-19 incidence during the Italian second wave. Using a LASSO algorithm, we isolate variables with high explanatory power. Then, we test if their explanatory power disappears after the introduction of the regional-level policies. Findings: The within-region variation of seven pre-covid characteristics is statistically significant (F-test p-value [Formula: see text]) and explains 19% of the province-level variation of covid-19 incidence, on top of region-specific factors, before regional policies were introduced. Its explanatory power declines to 7% after the introduction of regional policies, but is still significant (p-value [Formula: see text]), even in regions placed under stricter policies (p-value [Formula: see text]). Interpretation: Even within the same region, Italys provinces differ in exposure to covid-19 infection risk due to local characteristics. Regional policies did not eliminate these differences, but may have dampened them. Our evidence can be relevant for policy-makers who need to design non-pharmaceutical interventions. It also provides a methodological suggestion for researchers who attempt to estimate their causal effects.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two TB clinics in Mae Sot district, a border area of Thailand. Myanmar migrants with new TB were interviewed before (between September 2019 and March 2020) and during Thailands policy (between April 2020 and January 2021). We used multiple linear regression models to assess the association of health insurance and documentation status with stigma and social support before and during the policy on border closure. RESULTS: Of 229 migrants diagnosed new TB recruited, 117 and 112 were interviewed before and during Thailands policy on border closure. The relationship of stigma with health insurance and documentation status was modified by the policy. Migrants with health insurance reported significantly lower stigma during the policy compared to those without health insurance, whereas documented migrants had lower stigma before the policy compared to undocumented migrants. No significant association of health insurance and documentation status with social support was observed. Ethnicity, perceived TB severity and education level were also independently associated with TB-related stigma. CONCLUSION: The relationships between health insurance, documentation status and TB-related stigma were modified by Thailands policy on border closure among Myanmar migrants with TB in a border area of Myanmar and Thailand. Promotion of health insurance and well-planned documentation for migrants should be more discussed and strengthened among stakeholders and policymakers.

REVIEW METHODS: Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster.

Most importantly, video conferencing minimizes patient and physician exposure in situations such as these, and decreases risk in the immunocompromised population. Video conferencing, which has been shown to be just as safe and efficacious in treating patients, offers the ability to follow up with physicians while saving travel time and travel-related expenses. This in turn correlates with increased patient satisfaction. Video conferencing also allows physicians to expand their reach to patients in rural areas seeking advanced professional advice.

In particular, none of the literature focuses on connected anomaly subgraph detection with insufficient anomalous features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly Alignment in Attributed Networks (AAAN), which first detects connected anomaly subgraphs by aligning anomalies in two attributed networks (one with insufficient anomalous features and the other with sufficient anomalous features). Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (the Weibo, Baidu migration network, and COVID-19 pandemic datasets) show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. We can identify the crime hotspots in terms of city blocks from urban traffic networks, which are aligned with the criminal events reported on social networks.

Identifying asymptomatic individuals early through serial testing is recommended to control COVID-19 in nursing homes, both in response to an outbreak (outbreak testing of residents and healthcare personnel) and in facilities without outbreaks (non-outbreak testing of healthcare personnel). The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated. METHODS: Using published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented (i.e., effectiveness) through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated. RESULTS: Modeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.","output":"Modeling effectiveness of testing strategies to prevent COVID-19 in nursing homes United States, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy in ventilated patients suffering from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries an increased risk of exposure to virus-containing aerosol for the staff.

In addition, the occurrence of leukocytosis in response to glucocorticosteroid (GCS) therapy is often perceived as comorbid bacterial flora and is a reason for initiating antibiotic therapy. Therefore, an urgent task is to properly interpret leukocytosis in response to GCS therapy in COVID-19. The aim of the study was to examine dynamic changes in count of venous blood leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes in patients with moderate COVID-19 after systemic GCS. We analyzed parameters of complete blood count in 154 patients with verified moderate COVID-19, at the Temporary Infectious Diseases Hospital, the \\"Patriot\\" Park of the Moscow Region. The comparison group (I) consisted of 128 patients without clinical signs of bacterial infection and leukocytosis observed on admission, who were prescribed GCS therapy. The control group (II) consisted of 26 subjects showing on admission signs of bacterial infection - a cough with purulent sputum combined with neutrophilic leukocytosis. The dynamics in venous blood cell count was assessed in group I of patients before the onset, 3 and 6 days after beginning GCS therapy. We also compared count of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes between patients with developed leukocytosis in group I vs. group II. As a result, an increased count of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes was revealed according to assessing complete blood count test in patients from group I on days 3 and 6 of ongoing GCS therapy. All patients with developed leukocytosis after GCS admission (103 subjects) had no clinical signs of bacterial infection. Patients with developed leukocytosis from group I had increased count of monocytes (0.90 (0.84;1.02) on day 3 after GCS onset and 0.94 (0.87;1.26) on day 6 of GCS) compared with group II (0.61 [0.50;0.71]), p < 0.001. The inter-group count of leukocytes and neutrophils did not differ. Monocytosis after GCS therapy may serve as a differential diagnostic criterion to distinguish between glucocorticoid-induced leukocytosis and comorbid bacterial infection.

It is still unclear whether direct invasion of the nervous system by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 occurs; given the vast numbers of people infected at this point, this uncertainty suggests that nervous system infection is unlikely to represent a significant issue if it occurs at all.

Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards Mpro, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Apixaban, an orally available anticoagulant, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting its major protease in a non-competitive way"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is challenging every part of society. From a scientific point of view the first major task is to predict the dynamics of the pandemic, allowing governments to allocate proper resources and measures to fight it, as well as gauging the success of these measures by comparison with the predictions in hindsight. The vast majority of pandemic models are based on extensive models with large numbers of fit parameters, leading to individual descriptions for every hot spot on the world. This makes predictions and comparisons cumbersome, if not impossible. We here propose a different approach, by moving away from a description over time, and instead choosing the total number of infected people in an enclosed area as the independent variable. Analyzing a few hot spots data, we derive an empirical formula for the dynamics, dependent only on three variables. The final number of infections is strictly connected to one fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed population. Despite its simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries we have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a figure of merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows when a pandemic is ending.

Due to the rapid dissemination and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN--secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN--secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins. The obtained vaccine peptides successfully elicited specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

Here, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of NVSI-06-08 as a heterologous booster dose in adults previously vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV in a randomized, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial conducted in the United Arab Emirates (NCT05069129). Three groups of healthy adults over 18 years of age (600 participants per group) who had administered two doses of BBIBP-CorV 4-6-month, 7-9-month and >9-month earlier, respectively, were vaccinated with either a homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV or a heterologous booster of NVSI-06-08. The primary outcome was immunogenicity and safety of booster vaccinations. The exploratory outcome was cross-reactive immunogenicity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOCs). The incidence of adverse reactions was low in both booster vaccinations, and the overall safety profile of heterologous boost was quite similar to that of homologous boost. Heterologous NVSI-06-08 booster was immunogenically superior to homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV.

Variable recovery after a health stressor may be due in part to differences in biological mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, or system level, that are elicited in response to stressors. We describe the PRIME-KNEE study as an example of ongoing research to validate provocative clinical tests and biomarkers that predict resilience to specific health stressors. METHODS PRIME-KNEE is an ongoing, prospective cohort study that will enroll 250 adults 60 years undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Data are collected at baseline (pre-surgery), during surgery, daily for 7 days after surgery, and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months post-surgery. Provocative tests include a cognition-motor dual-task walking test, cerebrovascular reactivity assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, peripheral blood mononuclear cell reactivity ex vivo to lipopolysaccharide toxin and influenza vaccine, and heart rate variability during surgery. Cognitive, psychological, and physical performance batteries are collected at baseline to estimate prestressor reserve. Demographics, medications, comorbidities, and stressor characteristics are abstracted from the electronic medical record and via participant interview. Blood-based biomarkers are collected at baseline and postoperative day 1. Repeated measures after surgery include items from a delirium assessment tool and pain scales administered daily by telephone for 7 days and cognitive change index (participant and informant), lower extremity activities of daily living, pain scales, and step counts assessed by Garmin actigraphy at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery. Statistical models use these measures to characterize resilience phenotypes and evaluate prestressor clinical indicators associated with poststressor resilience. CONCLUSION If PRIME-KNEE validates feasible clinical tests and biomarkers that predict recovery trajectories in older surgical patients, these tools may inform surgical decision-making, guide pre-habilitation efforts, and elucidate mechanisms underlying resilience.

Additional harmful reagents, in addition to viruses, play a role in its etiology. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-induced myocarditis has recently been described, drawing attention to vaccine-induced myocarditis in children and adolescents. Its pathology is based on a series of complex immune responses, including initial innate immune responses in response to viral entry, adaptive immune responses leading to the development of antigen-specific antibodies, and autoimmune responses to cellular injury caused by cardiomyocyte rupture that releases antigens. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium eventually result in cardiac failure. Recent advancements in molecular biology have remarkably increased our understanding of myocarditis. In particular, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a hot topic in terms of the role of new biomarkers and the pathophysiology of myocarditis. Myocarditis has been linked with microRNA-221/222 (miR-221/222), miR-155, miR-10a*, and miR-590. Despite the lack of clinical trials of miRNA intervention in myocarditis yet, multiple clinical trials of miRNAs in other cardiac diseases have been aggressively conducted to help pave the way for future research, which is bolstered by the success of recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved small-RNA medications.

Research is recommended for creating and maintaining effective, relevant, and acceptable prevention programs and response services for student survivors. OBJECTIVE: The University of California (UC) Speaks Up study aims to examine factors contributing to intimate partner and sexual violence on 3 UC campuses and use the findings to develop and test interventions and policies to prevent violence, promote health, and lay the groundwork for subsequent large-scale quantitative research. METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted at UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara. Phase I (2017-2020) involved a resource audit; cultural consensus modeling of students perceptions of sexual consent; in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions with students to understand perceptions of campus environment related to experiences as well as prevention of and responses to violence; and IDIs with faculty, staff, and community stakeholders to investigate institutional and community arrangements influencing students lives and experiences. Phase II (2020-ongoing) involves IDIs with student survivors to assess the use and perceptions of campus and community services. Qualitative content analysis is used to generate substantive codes and subthemes that emerge, using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: In January 2019, we conducted 149 free-listing interviews and 214 web-based surveys with undergraduate and graduate and professional students for the cultural consensus modeling. Between February 2019 and June 2019, 179 IDIs were conducted with 86 (48%) undergraduate students, 21 (11.7%) graduate and professional students, 34 (19%) staff members, 27 (15.1%) faculty members, and 11 (6.1%) community stakeholders, and 35 focus group discussions (27/35, 77% with undergraduate students and 8/35, 23% with graduate and professional students) were conducted with 201 participants. Since September 2020, 50% (15/30) of the planned student survivor interviews have been conducted. This segment of data collection was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Data analysis and phase II data collection are ongoing. The findings will be used to develop and test interventions for preventing violence, promoting health and well-being, and ensuring that survivor services are relevant and acceptable to and meet the needs of all individuals in the campus community, including those who are typically understudied. The findings will also be used to prepare for rigorous, UCCsystem-wide public health prevention research.

Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of ARDS in this clinical population and to identify the association between the oxygenation status at 24 h after diagnosis and the 30-day mortality rates, stratified by the severity of ARDS. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 82 pediatric oncology patients, with a median age of 4 years, admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of ARDS between 2013 and 2021. Demographic and clinical factors were compared between the survivor (n = 52) and non-survivor (n = 30) groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the association between the oxygenation status at 24 h after diagnosis and the 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: The mean airway pressure at ARDS diagnosis, PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, oxygenation index (OI) value, peak inspiratory pressure, and lactate level at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis, as well as complications (i.e., septicemia and more than two extrapulmonary organ failures) and adjunctive continuous renal replacement therapy, were significant mortality risk factors. After adjusting for other covariates, the oxygenation status P/F ratio (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96C1.00, P = 0.043) and OI value (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02C1.23, P = 0.016) at 24 h remained independent mortality risk factors. According to the KaplanCMeier survival curve, a low P/F ratio ( 150) and high OI (>10) were associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality (50.9 and 52.9%, respectively; both P < 0.05) CONCLUSION: The P/F ratio and OI value measured at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis can provide a better stratification of patients according to ARDS disease severity to predict the 30-day mortality risk.","output":"The Association Between Oxygenation Status at 24 h After Diagnosis of Pulmonary Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and the 30-Day Mortality among Pediatric Oncological Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Despite multiple clinical trials using different agents, there is still a lack of specific treatment for COVID-19. Having the potential role in suppressing inflammation, immune modulation, antiviral and improving respiratory symptoms, this review discusses the potential role of methylxanthine drugs like pentoxifylline and caffeine in the management of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pathogenesis for clinical features like severe pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failures are excessive inflammation, oxidation, and cytokine storm by the exaggerated immune response. Drugs like pentoxifylline have already shown improvement of the symptoms of ARDS and caffeine has been in clinical use for decades to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in preterm infants and improve respiratory function. Pentoxifylline is well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecules that have already shown to suppress Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-) as well as other inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary diseases, and this may be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pentoxifylline enhances blood flow, improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation, and caffeine also efficiently improves tissue oxygenation, asthma, decreases pulmonary hypertension and an effective analgesic. There are significant shreds of evidence that proved the properties of pentoxifylline and caffeine against virus-related diseases as well. Along with the aforementioned evidences and high safety profiles, both pentoxifylline and caffeine offer a glimpse of considerations for future use as a potential adjuvant to COVID-19 treatment.

This was a retrospective, exploratory study. Social factors, depression, and prostate screening data on 267 male patients were retrieved from medical records from 2014 to 2018. Patients that were not screened for depression were associated with a lower probability of having received a PSA screening (OR = .40, p = 02). Of those screened for depression, higher scores were associated with lower PSA screening (OR = .89, p = .02). Patients who self-identified as Hispanic (OR = .19, p <. 001), African American (AA) (OR = .06, P = .01) or White (OR = .12, P = .02) had lower odds of PSA screening compared to Black-Caribbean. The above clinical evidence is a practice implication for nurses and health care professionals. Depression screening predicted higher rates of prostate screening, while higher depression scores predicted lower prostate screening. AA and Hispanic subgroups were less likely to be screened for prostate cancer than the non-U.S. born Black-Caribbean men. Findings underscore the importance of developing community-based culturally sensitive approaches to prostate preventative care.

Since March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases have steadily risen in India. Various preventive measures have been taken to contain the spread of COVID-19. With restrictions on human activities, anthropogenic emissions driving air pollution levels have seen a reduction since March 23, 2020, when the government imposed the first nationwide shutdown. The landlocked Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) has many densely-populated cities, witnessing high levels of particulate matter due to both nature-driven and anthropogenic elements. Kanpur is an urban metropolis in the IGP with high aerosol loading, and this paper explores the impact of restricted anthropogenic activities on aerosol characteristics in Kanpur. OBJECTIVES. This study aims to investigate the change in aerosol optical depth level and its related parameters during the shutdown phases in Kanpur city compared to the same time periods in 2017C2019. METHODS. Aerosol optical properties such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm, Angstrom exponent (AE), fine mode fraction (FMF) of AOD at 500 nm and single scattering albedo (SSA) at 440 nm were obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station operating in Kanpur from the 1st March to the 30th April for 2017C2020. RESULTS. A significant decrease in aerosol loading was observed during the shutdown period compared to the pre-and partial shutdown periods in 2020 as well as during the same time periods of 2017C2019. Mean AOD, FMF and SSA were 0.37, 0.43 and 0.89, respectively, during the shutdown period in 2020. A 20C35% reduction in mean AOD levels was observed during the shutdown period in 2020 as compared to the same period in 2017C2019. CONCLUSIONS. The shutdown led to an improvement in air quality due to decreases in anthropogenic emissions. As fine particles, typically from urban and industrial emissions, dominate episodic air pollution events, this study can be further utilized by the scientific community and regulators to strengthen the emergency response action plan to check high pollution episodes in Kanpur city until cleaner technologies are in place.

Students living with disability were able to self-identify and to share their experiences relating to these procedures. As a result, data from 493 student survey responses and 9 subsequent follow-on interviews were analysed. At the same time, 10 disability support staff were asked about barriers and enablers faced by students. It was found that most students requiring assistance due to disability, identified as having a hidden disability (learning, cognition or psychiatric conditions). It was also found that accommodations most often related to assessment. While students were most satisfied with academic adjustment plans developed with the support staff, self-perceived notions of stigma associated with disability negatively impacted upon interactions with peers and teaching staff.

These measures effectively ensured a smooth, orderly and safe operation of the emergency department. As of the writing of this manuscript, there has been no active COVID-19 infection in patients and medical staff in the emergency department, and no infection in patients admitted to PKUFH through the emergency department. This study describes the prevention and control measures in the emergency department of PKUFH during the outbreak of COVID-19, aiming to provide some reference for domestic and international medical institutions.","output":"Management practices of emergency departments in general hospitals based on blockage of chain of infection during a COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has so far infected more than 31 million people around the world, and its impact is being felt by all Patients with diseases such as COVID-19 should ideally be treated in negative pressure isolation rooms However, due to the overwhelming demand for hospital beds, patients have been treated in general wards, hospital corridors and makeshift hospitals Adequate building ventilation in hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease (Escombe et al 2007 PLoS Med 4;Escombe et al 2019 BMC Infect Dis 19, 88 (doi:10 1186/s12879-019-3717-9);Morawska & Milton 2020 Clin Infect Dis ciaa939 (doi:10 1093/cid/ciaa939)), to exit lockdown safely, and reduce the chance of subsequent waves of outbreaks A recently reported air-conditioner-induced COVID-19 outbreak caused by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China (Lu et al 2020 Emerg Infect Dis 26) exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces We argue that displacement ventilation (either mechanical or natural ventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoors, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans We have also discussed and addressed the issue of the 'lock-up effect' We provide guidelines for such mechanically assisted, naturally ventilated makeshift hospitals","output":"Displacement ventilation: a viable ventilation strategy for makeshift hospitals and public buildings to contain COVID-19 and other airborne diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthocyanins are naturally occurring water-soluble flavonoids abundantly present in fruits and vegetables.

Community level athletes had better coping when a training program was provided. No difference between individual or team community athletes for well-being or coping scores. Australian community level athletes faced unprecedented changes to their training and competition options as the global COVID-19 pandemic took a stronghold. This disruption was predicted to have a negative impact on emotional well-being as communities braced through periods of social isolation and physical distancing requirements. This study provides an Australian perspective on the emotional well-being of community level athletes and the extent to which they coped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emotional well-being and coping were measured using the Brief Emotional Experience Scale and the 28-item Brief Cope Scale. Both instruments were administered along with other questions pertaining to participant demographics and training status via an online survey between April and June 2020. The survey was disseminated to community athletes through word-of-mouth and social media platforms. No significant differences in emotional well-being were observed between athlete groups as a result of COVID-19 and its associated restrictions. Coping scores also appeared to be preserved in Australian community athletes, which contrasts the impact expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While tentative, the observed preservation in coping may have buffered potential declines in emotional well-being, which has been documented in professional and semi-professional athletes and the general population. These unexpected findings and tentative suppositions warrant further investigation and highlight the importance of conducting a country- or region-specific approach to examining the impact of COVID-19 on community athletes, as responses to COVID-19 are undoubtedly not consistent throughout the world.","output":"A Survey to Evaluate the Association of COVID-19 Restrictions on Perceived Mood and Coping in Australian Community Level Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for the identification of viral nucleic acid is the current standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but technical issues limit its utilization for large-scale screening. Serological immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG testing has been proposed as a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the results of the rapid serological VivaDiag test for SARS-CoV-2Crelated IgM/IgG detection with those of the standard RT-PCR laboratory test for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. METHODS: We simultaneously performed both serological and molecular tests with a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients. The results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test for analyzing IgM/IgG expression were compared with those of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RESULTS: Of the 191 subjects, 70 (36.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results, while 34 (17.3%) tested positive based on serological IgM/IgG expression. Additionally, 13 (6.8%) subjects tested positive based on serological test results, but also tested negative based on RT-PCR results. The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. Interestingly, the performance of both assays improved 8 days after symptom appearance. After 10 days had passed since symptom appearance, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay (proportion of positive results: 40% vs 20%). Multivariate analysis showed that age >58 years (P<.01) and period of >15 days after symptom onset (P<.02) were significant and independent factors associated with serological test positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test analyzed in this study seems limited in terms of usefulness when diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

'Green zones'-areas where the virus is under control based on a uniform set of conditions-can progressively return to normal economic and social activity levels, and mobility between them is permitted. By contrast, stricter public health measures are in place in 'red zones', and mobility between red and green zones is restricted. France and Spain were among the first countries to introduce green zoning in April 2020. Subsequently, more and more countries followed suit and the European Commission advocated for the implementation of a European green zoning strategy, which has been supported by the EU member states. While there remain coordination problems, green zoning has proven to be an effective strategy for containing the spread of the virus and limiting its negative economic and social impact. This strategy should provide important lessons and prove useful in future outbreaks. Research in epidemiology indicates that thoroughly implemented and operationalised green zoning can prevent the spread of a transmittable disease that is poorly understood, highly virulent, and potentially highly lethal.

The aim of this study was to use Bartholomew and Horowitzs model (Bartholomew and Horowitz in J Pers Soc Psychol 61(2): 226, 2019) to test a sample of Italian individuals to determine the mediation role of loneliness and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms in the relationship between attachment styles and mental health issues in the context of the pandemic. Method A cross-sectional research study was conducted using a sample of 330 Italian participants (82.1% women;mean age = 34.3 years;SD = 13.16) who completed online self-reported measures of attachment styles (RQ), loneliness (RULS), COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms (C-19ASS) and mental health problems (GHQ-12). Serial mediation analyses were performed, and bootstrap tests were included. Results Our results supported the hypothesized model with respect to each attachment style (p < 0.001). In particular, insecure attachment styles predict mental health problems both directly and indirectly, through loneliness and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms. In addition, loneliness directly influences mental health problems and also mediates the relationship between insecure attachment styles and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms which, in turn, positively predict mental health problems. Conclusions Our findings reinforce the importance of attachment in peoples processes of adapting to experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The study makes an important contribution to developing effective prevention and intervention strategies to support peoples wellbeing in the context of the pandemic.","output":"Attachment style and mental health during the later stages of COVID\\\\19 pandemic: the mediation role of loneliness and COVID-19 anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: On 31 January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was first confirmed in Italy and spread rapidly across the country leading to a national lockdown.

In response to these challenges, this study has developed a decision model that optimizes workforce allocation for projects to achieve sustainable workforce management, a tradeoff between pandemic prevention and work resumption. The priority of project resumption was evaluated using basic characteristics, the long- and short-term strategies, and the regional pandemic situation. The energy level of skilled workers was graded according to construction team size, skill level, and experience. Sustainable allocation principles and paths were explored to target four different types of work resumption plans.

RESULTS: We found a 9-fold excess of GCU transversions among SARS-CoV-2 mutations over relative substitution frequencies between SARS-CoV-2 and a close relative coronavirus from bats (RaTG13). This suggests that mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 have changed after transmission to humans.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis performed, with cohorts classified a priori by multiples of the upper limit of normal (ULN). 277 patients were admitted during a 7-week period in 2020; 176 were included (90% received invasive ventilation). hs-TnT at admission was 16.5 (9.0 to 49.3) ng/L, 56% had concentrations >ULN. 56 patients (31.8%) died during the index admission. Admission hs-TnT level was lower in survivors (12.0 (8.0-27.8) vs 28.5 (14.0 to 81.0) ng/L, pa?=a?0.001). Univariate predictors of mortality were age, APACHE-II Score and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.73, pa?=a?0.007). By multivariate regression, only age (HR 1.33, CI: 1.16.to 1.51, p < 0.01) and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.94, CI: 1.22 to 3.10, pa?=a?0.006) remained predictive.

A new strategy is developed to update the weighting factor of the mean best position by the reciprocal of multiplying the fitness of each best particle with the average fitness of all best particles, which can enhance the global search capacity. To increase the particle diversity, a probability function is designed to generate new particles in the updating iteration. When compared to the state-of-the-art estimation algorithms on the epidemic datasets of China, Italy and the US, the proposed method achieves good accuracy and convergence at a comparable computational complexity.

PURPOSE Utilization of telemedicine and telepharmacy services has become increasingly popular, as specifically noted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article describes the implementation of and services provided by emergency medicine pharmacists (EMPs) as part of a telemedicine team in the emergency department (ED). SUMMARY This report describes the telemedicine and telepharmacy services provided to EDs in the Mayo Clinic Health System from the Mayo Clinic Rochester ED. Telepharmacy services provided by EMPs started in 2018. EMPs cover telepharmacy calls as part of their shift within the ED in Rochester. Recommendations and interventions are documented in the electronic medical record. A retrospective review evaluated interventions provided from November 18, 2018, through November 10, 2020. Baseline patient demographics, as well as the type and number of interventions provided by EMPs, hospital site, and time spent on the interventions, were collected. Telepharmacy consults could include multiple interventions and be classified as more than one type of intervention.

Here, we report a unique recombinant HAdV strain (CBJ113) isolated from a HAdV-positive child with SARI. The whole-genome sequence was determined using Sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome indicated that the CBJ113 strain shares a common origin with HAdV-C2, HAdV-C6, HAdV-C1, HAdV-C5, and HAdV-C57 and formed a novel subclade on the same branch as other HAdV-C subtypes. BootScan and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses showed that the CBJ113 genome has an intra-subtype recombinant structure and comprises gene regions mainly originating from two circulating viral strains: HAdV-1 and HAdV-2. The parental penton base, pVI, and DBP genes of the recombinant strain clustered with the HAdV-1 prototype strain, and the E1B, hexon, fiber, and 100 K genes of the recombinant clustered within the HAdV-2 subtype, meanwhile the E4orf1 and DNA polymerase genes of the recombinant shared the greatest similarity with those of HAdV-5 and HAdV-6, respectively. All of these findings provide insight into our understanding of the dynamics of the complexity of the HAdV-C epidemic.

Using ps20 knockout mice we provide evidence that intranasal MHV-1 infection results in increased lung viral titers in ps20(?/?) compared to ps20(+/+) mice. Accompanying MHV-1 infection we observe an increase in the number of neutrophils infiltrating the BAL and an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the lung draining lymph nodes of ps20(?/?) compared with ps20(+/+) mice. Gene expression levels for the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2 are elevated in the lungs of ps20(?/?) mice post-MHV-1 infection.

No notable differences in other immune cell profiles were observed between the ps20(+/+) and ps20(?/?) mice. Accordingly, we examined MHV-1 infection of neutrophils and provide evidence that neutrophils isolated from ps20(?/?) mice are more susceptible to MHV-1 infection than neutrophils isolated from ps20(+/+) mice. These data suggest roles for ps20 in regulating expression of neutrophil-specific chemotactic factors, thereby potentially modulating neutrophil migration, and in modulating neutrophil susceptibility to MHV-1 infection.","output":"WFDC1/ps20: A host factor that influences the neutrophil response to murine hepatitis virus (MHV) 1 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated changes in the severity of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additional questionnaires about sociodemographic factors, personal and family histories of OCRD, COVID-19 related events, compulsivity and impulsivity traits, schizotypal symptoms, and the severity of depression, anxiety and stress levels, were also used. Participants reported that OCD, hoarding disorder (HD) and skin picking disorder (SPD) symptoms significantly worsened during the pandemic along with increased disability, more affective symptoms and reduced quality of life. Female gender, a higher number of COVID-19 related stressful events, and higher pre-COVID-19 fear of harm and symmetry symptoms predicted more severe OCD symptoms during the pandemic, whereas lack of a HD diagnosis by a mental health professional and more severe schizotypal symptoms predicted worsened hoarding symptoms. Greater compulsivity traits were associated with more severe COVID-19 pandemic obsessive-compulsive and hoarding symptoms. These data indicate that the immense distress resulting from the COVID-19 included significant deterioration of OCRDs' symptoms, particularly of OCD, HD and SPD. It was also possible to identify a pre-pandemic profile of people most at risk of pandemic-related deterioration in OCRDs' symptoms, which may prove valuable for preventative initiatives in relation to the likely future waves of COVID-19 or of other communicable diseases.

AIMS: To evaluate or assess whether the samples taken by the patient for COVID-19 testing during this pandemic period can be used in real-life experience. METHODS: Three different samples (nasopharyngeal taken by the healthcare worker, nasopharyngeal, and saliva taken by the patient) from 132 patients were evaluated for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the samples in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared with real-life experience. RESULTS: Paired analyzes were performed by comparing each sample taken by the healthcare worker with the sample taken by the patient. The sensitivity of the three samples (nasopharyngeal taken by the healthcare worker, nasopharyngeal, and saliva taken by the patient) in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 was (100%, 98.7%, and 96.1%, respectively) accepted to be accurate. CONCLUSIONS: The sample taken by the paramedic was compatible compared to the real-life experience for the samples taken by the patient in the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Therefore, the study aimed to assess the communitys perception of COVID-19 and its associated factors in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 635 Gondar administrative town residents, from April 20 to April 27, 2020. Study participants were selected using a cluster sampling technique. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Epi-Data version 4.6 and STATA 14 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Logistic regressions (bivariable and multivariable) were performed to identify statistically significant variables at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 635 study participants, 623 have completed the study with a 98.1% response rate. The mean age of participants was 36.32 years (SD  13.24). The overall magnitude of the communitys misconception about COVID-19 stood at 56.9% (349). Age and religion showed a negative association with misconceptions. To be specific, being in the age group of 27C33 (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32, 0.86) and being a Muslim (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34, 0.78) were negatively associated with the misconception of COVID-19, whereas occupation and awareness showed positive associations with the misconception. To be specific, having an unemployed occupational status (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.14, 2.82) and being unaware of the number of cases of COVID-19 (AOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05, 2.62) were positively associated with the communitys misconception on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the communitys misconception about COVID-19 among Gondar town residents was high. Age, religion, unemployment, and unawareness about the number of COVID-19 cases were significant factors of misconception about COVID-19. Thus, stakeholders ought to build community perceptions about COVID 19.

STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Included studies must have characterized the clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients treated with oral ribavirin for symptomatic NIRVIs. Case reports and series with <5 cases, conference abstracts, and articles written in languages other than English were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS Of the 1256 unique reports, 15 met inclusion criteria: 12 retrospective, 3 prospective, and 3 comparative with untreated control groups. All studies except for 2 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) studies were in immunocompromised patients (9 malignancy/stem cell transplant, 4 lung transplant). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 31% in malignancy/stem cell transplant recipients treated with oral ribavirin, and 1/108 (0.9%) ribavirin-treated lung transplant recipients died at 30 days. Three studies (one each for malignancy, lung transplant, and MERS-CoV) suggested a clinical outcomes benefit with oral ribavirin compared with supportive care alone; however, the nonrandomized design precludes efficacy determination. Hemolysis was the most common adverse reaction, occurring in 14% (54/375) of patients. Ribavirin was discontinued in 4% of patients secondary to adverse reactions.

METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study. All included subjects exhibited a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Spectral domain macular OCTA was performed at least 2 weeks after recovery from systemic COVID-19. Vessel density (VD) of the superficial (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) and the area of the FAZ were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients versus age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Thirty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy normal controls were studied. Mean quality scan index was 7.64  0.66 in the COVID cases and 8.34  0.71 in the normal controls (pa?=a?0.001). Mean SCP VD and DCP VD of the COVID cohort were significantly lower than the SCP VD and DCP VD of the control group in the foveal and parafoveal regions.

We here used neuroimaging in humans to investigate this neural competition by lateralized stimulations with other speech samples and ipsilateral or contralateral lateralized feedback of actively produced self speech utterances in the form of various speech vowels. In experiment 1, we show, first, that others' speech classifications during active self speech lead to activity in the planum temporale (Pte) when both self and other speech samples were presented together to only the left or right ear. The contralateral PTe also seemed to indifferently respond to single self and other speech samples. Second, specific activity in the left anterior superior temporal cortex (STC) was found during dichotic stimulations (i.e. self and other speech presented to separate ears). Unlike previous studies, this left anterior STC activity supported self speech rather than other speech processing. Furthermore, right mid and anterior STC was more involved in other speech processing. These results signify specific mechanisms for self and other speech processing in the left and right STC beyond a more general speech processing in PTe. Third, other speech recognition in the context of listening to recorded self speech in experiment 2 led to largely symmetric activity in STC and additionally in inferior frontal subregions. The latter was previously reported to be generally relevant for other speech perception and classification, but we found frontal activity only when other speech classification was challenged by recorded but not by active self speech samples. Altogether, unlike formerly established brain networks for uncompetitive other speech perception, active self speech during other speech perception seemingly leads to a neural reordering, functional reassignment, and unusual lateralization of AC and frontal brain activations.","output":"Neural competition between concurrent speech production and other speech perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 outbreak context, some industries were seriously affected, and the T&amp;T (travel and tourism) industry is unarguably one of those industries.

Most of the assays report very good clinical performance characteristics in well-controlled clinical settings. However, there is a growing belief that good performance characteristics that are obtained during clinical performance trials might not be sufficient to deliver good diagnostic results in population-wide screens that are usually characterized with low seroprevalence. In this paper, we developed a serological assay against N, S1 and RBD using a bead-based multiplex platform and a rules-based computational approach to assess the performance of single and multi-antigen readouts in well-defined clinical samples and in a population-wide serosurvey from blood donors. Even though assays based on single antigen readouts performed similarly well in the clinical samples, there was a striking difference between the antigens on the population-wide screen. Asymptomatic individuals with low antibody titers and sub-optimal assay specificity might contribute to the large discrepancies in population studies with low seroprevalence. A multi-antigen assay requiring partial agreement between RBD, N and S1 readouts exhibited enhanced specificity, less dependency on assay cut-off values and an overall more robust performance in both sample settings.

During NPT-anaesthesia, gas insufflation provides some positive oropharyngeal pressure that differs from the proximal airway pressure (Paw) owing to the flow-dependent pressure drop across the NPT (PNPT ). AIMS This study aimed to investigate whether PNPT could be used for calculating oropharyngeal pressure during NPT-assisted anaesthesia. METHODS In a physical model of NPT-anaesthesia, using Rohrer's equation, we calculated PNPT for three NPTs (3.5, 4.0, and 5.0, mm inner diameter) under oxygen and several sevoflurane in oxygen combinations in two ventilatory scenarios (continuous positive airway pressure and intermittent positive pressure ventilation). We then calculated oropharyngeal pressure as Paw minus PNPT . Calculated and measured oropharyngeal pressure couples of values were compared with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) to assess accuracy. We also investigated whether oropharyngeal pressure accuracy depends on the NPT diameter, flow rate, gas composition, and leak size. Using PNPT charts, we tested whether PNPT calculation was feasible in clinical practice. RESULTS When we tested small-diameter NPTs at high flow or high peak inspiratory pressure, Paw measurements markedly overestimated oropharyngeal pressure. Comparing measured and calculated maximum and minimum oropharyngeal pressure couples yielded RMSDs less than 0.5 cmH2 O regardless of ventilatory modality, NPT diameter, flow rate, gas composition, and leak size. CONCLUSION During NPT-assisted anaesthesia, Paw readings on the anaesthetic monitoring machine overestimate oropharyngeal pressure especially for smaller-diameter NPTs and higher flow, and to a lesser extent for large leaks. Given the importance of calculating oropharyngeal pressure in guiding NPT-ventilation in clinical practice, we propose an accurate calculation using Rohrer's equation method, or approximating oropharyngeal pressure from flow and pressure readings on the anaesthetic machine using the PNPT charts.","output":"Nasopharyngeal tubes in paediatric anaesthesia: is the flow-dependent pressure drop across the tube suitable for calculating oropharyngeal pressure?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute ischemic stroke may occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but risk factors, in-hospital events, and outcomes are not well studied in large cohorts. We identified risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We analyzed the data from 54 health care facilities using the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 dataset. The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.3%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8163 patients with COVID-19. Among all patients with COVID-19, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6-2.4]; P<0.0001) after adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 199 (1.0%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 19 513 patients without COVID-19.

Patients and Methods RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and from 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All HCM patients were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999 and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. Results Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4-6% of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of COVID-19, the transcript for ACE2, a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change 3.53, q-value=1.30x10-23), which was confirmed with qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold-change 3.78; p=5.22x10-4), and Western blot confirmed a >5-fold over-expression of ACE2 protein (fold-change 5.34, p=1.66x10-6). Conclusions Over 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM indicating perhaps the hearts compensatory effort to mount an anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic response. However, given that the SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.","output":"Marked Up-Regulation of ACE2 in Hearts of Patients with Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Implications for SARS-CoV-2-Mediated COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the chronic nature of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) self-management is considered an essential part of therapy to improve physical function, activity, pain and quality of life (QoL).

Despite initial concerns that exercise training may worsen symptoms in this group, several studies have reported improvements in functional capacity and well-being following exercise-based rehabilitation in PH. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of exercise-based rehabilitation for people with PH. Primary outcomes were exercise capacity, adverse events during the intervention period and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Secondary outcomes included cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, functional class, clinical worsening during follow-up, mortality and changes in B-type natriuretic peptide. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register of Trials up to August 2016, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. In addition we searched CENTRAL and the PEDro database up to August 2016 and handsearched relevant journals. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on exercise-based rehabilitation programmes for PH. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included six RCTs and were able to extract data from five studies. The majority of participants were Group I pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Study duration ranged from three to 15 weeks. Exercise programmes included both inpatient- and outpatient-based rehabilitation that incorporated both upper and lower limb exercise. The mean six-minute walk distance following exercise training was 60.12 metres higher than control (30.17 to 90.07 metres, n = 165, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence; minimal important difference was 30 metres), the mean peak oxygen uptake was 2.4 ml/kg/minute higher (1.4 to 3.4 ml/kg/min, n = 145, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence) and the mean peak power in the intervention groups was 16.4 W higher (10.9 to 22.0 higher, n = 145, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). The mean change in HRQoL for the SF-36 physical component score was 4.63 points higher (0.80 to 8.47 points, n = 33, 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence) and for the SF-36 mental component score was 4.17 points higher (0.01 to 8.34 points; n = 33; 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence). One study reported a single adverse event, where a participant stopped exercise training due to lightheadedness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In people with PH, exercise-based rehabilitation results in clinically relevant improvements in exercise capacity. Exercise training was not associated with any serious adverse events. Whilst most studies reported improvements in HRQoL, these may not be clinically important. Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence to be low. The small number of studies and lack of information on participant selection makes it difficult to generalise these results across the spectrum of people with PH.","output":"Exercise-based rehabilitation programmes for pulmonary hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) sparked global concern for its outbreak and pandemic. It caused severe respiratory tract infections and a significant proportion of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Several studies have investigated the intestinal flora of COVID-19. However, so far there has been no evidence demonstrating the evidence on the association of COVID-19 with intestinal flora through meta-analysis. A systematic and comprehensive understanding of their relationship is essential to provide public health prevention or treatment strategy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Observational studies (cohort studies, case-control, and cross-sectional studies) and clinical trials will be eligible. Studies eligible for inclusion must contain participants with COVID-19. Systematic searches will be conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBSCO, World Health Organization COVID-19 database, China National Knowledge Internet, WanFang Data, Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Databases. A pre-designed search strategy of medical subject headings and free text terms for COVID-19 and intestinal flora will be used. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. The reviewers will then extract data from each eligible article based on PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study design). The risk of bias and quality of included studies will be assessed using an appropriate tool. A random-effects meta-analysis will be considered where there are sufficiently homogeneous studies; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Heterogeneity among studies will be assessed using I statistics. If substantial heterogeneity detected, subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be conducted to look for the potential causes.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the therapeutic success of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in severe ARF in the course of COVID-19 in a noncritical care setting as well as to identify predictors of HFNO failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between March and December 2020. We enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom HFNO therapy was used. The primary outcome measure was death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission. RESULTS: Of the 380 patients with COVID-19, 116 individuals (30.5%) requiring HFNO due to severe pneumonia were analyzed. The primary outcome, defined as death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission, occurred in 54 patients (46.6%). The overall 30-day mortality was 30.2% (35/116) in the entire cohort and 64.7% (34/51) among patients requiring endotracheal intubation. A multivariable analysis revealed that the ROX index measured within the first 12 hours of therapy below 3.85 was related to increased mortality (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.03-11.35) compared with the ROX index of 4.88 or higher.

However, associations between rumination, SCI, presenteeism, and psychological well-being are not fully understood. We hypothesized that SCI and presenteeism mediate the associations between rumination and subjective well-being (SWB) and subjective ill-being (SIB). Hence, we investigated the mediating roles of SCI and presenteeism in this study. METHODS: A total of 458 adult workers (mean age, 40.811.9 years; 44.1% male), who were recruited in Tokyo using convenience sampling, were analyzed in this study. The Ruminative Responses Scale, Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment, Work Limitations Questionnaire 8, and Subjective Well-being Inventory were used to evaluate rumination, SCI, presenteeism, and psychological well-being (SWB and SIB), respectively. Path analyses were performed to evaluate the relations between these parameters. RESULTS: The path analysis indicated that rumination, SCI, and presenteeism were directly and negatively associated with SWB and SIB. Regarding indirect effects, rumination was negatively associated with SWB and SIB via SCI, presenteeism, and both SCI and presenteeism. Furthermore, SCI was negatively associated with SWB and SIB via presenteeism. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SCI and presenteeism mediate the associations of rumination with SWB and SIB in Japanese adult workers.

The study was conducted on ten disabled athletes belonging to a football school in Campania, Italy. The comparison between the two sports seasons is given in numerical terms by the statistical comparison of the results of the adapted motor tests concerning aerobic capacity and conditional capacities, which were administered to the athletes at the beginning and at the end of both sports seasons. From this comparison, in both seasons, minor improvements in the 2020/2021 season were found in athletes, between the entry and exit tests.

This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHOs announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: hasty science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes.","output":"Health and science-related disinformation on COVID-19: A content analysis of hoaxes identified by fact-checkers in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their dependence on cellular organisms for metabolism and replication, viruses are typically named and assigned to species according to their genome structure and the original host that they infect. But because viruses often infect multiple hosts and the numbers of distinct lineages within a host can be vast, their delineation into species is often dictated by arbitrary sequence thresholds, which are highly inconsistent across lineages. Here we apply an approach to determine the boundaries of viral species based on the detection of gene flow within populations, thereby defining viral species according to the biological species concept (BSC). Despite the potential for gene transfer between highly divergent genomes, viruses, like the cellular organisms they infect, assort into reproductively isolated groups and can be organized into biological species. This approach revealed that BSC-defined viral species are often congruent with the taxonomic partitioning based on shared gene contents and host tropism, and that bacteriophages can similarly be classified in biological species. These results open the possibility to use a single, universal definition of species that is applicable across cellular and acellular lifeforms.","output":"Biological species in the viral world."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare providers caring for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have had significant concerns about the intersection of MS and COVID-19.

We report on the translation of the Project ECHO model for the rapid sharing of knowledge among MS clinical providers during COVID-19. Methods: The ECHO MS COVID-19 Response Clinic was a videoconference-based education and case consultation program offered to providers in the U.S. who care for individuals with MS. The Response Clinic was offered as four sessions, each delivered by three regional hubs. Data were collected on participation and the self-reported impact of the program. Results: A total of 132 unique providers participated in the Response Clinic, which consisted of 11 didactic modules and 43 case consultations. Participant providers overwhelmingly indicated that the program improved their knowledge, attitude, and skills for providing healthcare for people with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: The Project ECHO model was successfully adapted to serve the needs of the MS community during COVID-19, suggesting the program could be continued or could be expanded to other disease areas for a similar purpose.

The purpose of this paper is to establish service industries as increasingly significant aspects of urban development within the Asia-Pacific, and to propose a conceptual and analytical framework for scholarly investigation within this important research domain. To this end the paper explores a sequence of related themes and issues, concerning the larger developmental implications of urban services growth (or tertiarization), the facets of urban transformation associated with tertiarization, and a preliminary typology of urban service functions which acknowledges the rich diversity of service vocations and stages of development within the Asia-Pacific. The paper concludes that advanced servicesspecialized, intermediate service industries, advanced-technology services, and creative service industrieswill be quite crucial to the development of city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, with respect to employment growth and human capital formation, to the urban economic (or export) base, to the operation of flexible production systems, and to competitive advantage. The development of these urban service poles will require innovative policy commitments and regulatory adjustments, as will the multi-centred specialized urban service corridors which function as engines of regional economic growth, and which provide platforms for national modernization and responses to the pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. To date, urban and regional development strategies for service industries within the Asia-Pacific have privileged globalization, industrial restructuring, and modernization aims, but there is also an encouraging record of more progressive planning experimentation in some jurisdictions, incorporating principles of sustainability and co-operative development. There is also increasing interest in policies to support cultural and creative industries among Asia-Pacific city-regions, informed by some recent urban policy experimentation in this domain. These experiences can offer models for further policy and programmatic innovation in the 21st century, as service industries continue to play larger roles in urban and regional development within the Asia-Pacific.","output":"Service industries, globalization, and urban restructuring within the Asia-Pacific: new development trajectories and planning responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce an extension to Kermack and McKendrick's classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in epidemiology, whose underlying mechanism of infection consists of individuals attending randomly generated social gatherings.

Some specific instances yield models already studied in the literature, to which the present work provides a probabilistic foundation. The basic reproduction number is seen to depend quadratically on the average size of the gatherings, which may be helpful to understand how restrictions on social gatherings affect the spread of the disease.

The neutralizing antibody response induced by the SME-VLPs was similar to that induced by the inactivated oil vaccine (OEV) of GX-YL5, and higher than those induced by the SM-VLPs, ME-VLPs and commercial live vaccine H120. More importantly, the SME-VLPs elicited higher percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes than the SM-VLPs, ME-VLPs and OEV of GX-YL5. Compared with the OEV of GX-YL5, higher levels of IL-4 and IFN-?3 were also induced by the SME-VLPs. Moreover, the mucosal immune response (sIgA) induced by the SME-VLPs in the tear and oral swabs was comparable to that induced by the H120 vaccine and higher than that induced by the OEV of GX-YL5. In the challenge experiment, the SME-VLPs resulted in significantly lower viral RNA levels in the trachea and higher protection scores than the OEV of GX-YL5 and H120 vaccines, and induced comparable viral RNA levels in the kidneys, and tear and oral swabs to the OEV of GX-YL5. In summary, among the three VLPs, the SME-VLPs carrying the S, M and E proteins of IBV could stimulate the strongest humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses and provide effective protection, indicating that it would be an attractive vaccine candidate for IB.","output":"Construction and Immunogenicity Comparison of Three Virus-Like Particles Carrying Different Combinations of Structural Proteins of Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Advancing age is the primary selection criterion for community screening for atrial fibrillation (AF), with selection often restricted to those aged 65 years. If multivariable models were shown to have considerable additional value over age alone in predicting AF risk among younger individuals, AF screening could be expanded to patients with lower age, but with high AF risk as per a validated risk model. METHODS: We validated risk models CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology model for AF) and FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study model for AF), and risk scores CHA2DS2-VASc and CHA2DS2-VA, and presented their predictive abilities for 5-year and 10-year AF risk versus that of age alone in a young Dutch population cohort (PREVEND) free from AF at baseline. We assessed discrimination by the C-statistic and calibration by the calibration plot and stratified Kaplan-Meier plot using survey-weighted Cox models. RESULTS: During 5-year and 10-year follow-up there were n=98 (2.46/1000 person-years) and n=249 (3.29/1000 person-years) new AF cases, respectively, among 8265 participants with mean age 4913 years. CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF both showed good discrimination for 5-year and 10-year AF (C-statistic range 0.83-0.86) with accurate calibration for 5-year AF, but overestimation of 10-year AF risk in highest-risk individuals. CHA2DS2-VASc and CHA2DS2-VA relatively underperformed. Age alone showed similar discrimination to that of CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF both in the overall, young PREVEND cohort and in subgroups for lower age and lower stroke risk. CONCLUSION: Multivariable models accurately discriminate for 5-year and 10-year AF risk among young European community-dwelling individuals. However, their additional discriminatory value over age alone was limited. Selection strategies for primary AF screening using multivariable models should not be expanded to younger individuals.","output":"Validating risk models versus age alone for atrial fibrillation in a young Dutch population cohort: should atrial fibrillation risk prediction be expanded to younger community members?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Managing uncertainty is central to expert practice, yet how novice trainees navigate these moments is likely different than what has been described by experienced clinicians. Exploring trainees' experiences with uncertainty could therefore help explicate the unique cues that they attend to, how they appraise their comfort in these moments, and how they enact responses within the affordances of their training environment. METHODS Informed by constructivist grounded theory, we explored how novice emergency medicine trainees experienced and managed clinical uncertainty in practice. We used a critical incident technique to prompt participants to reflect on experiences with uncertainty immediately following a clinical shift, exploring the cues they attended to and the approaches they used to navigate these moments. Two investigators coded line-by-line using constant comparison, organizing the data into focused codes. The research team discussed the relationships between these codes and developed a set of themes that supported our efforts to theorize about the phenomenon. RESULTS We enrolled 13 trainees in their first two years of postgraduate training across two institutions. They expressed uncertainty about the root causes of the patient problems they were facing and the potential management steps to take, but also expressed a pervasive sense of uncertainty about their own abilities and their appraisals of the situation. This, in turn, led to challenges with selecting, interpreting, and using the cues in their environment effectively. Participants invoked several approaches to combat this sense of uncertainty about themselves, rehearsing steps before a clinical encounter, checking their interpretations with others, and implicitly calibrating their appraisals to those of more experienced team members. CONCLUSIONS Trainees' struggles with the legitimacy of their interpretations impact their experiences with uncertainty. Recognizing these ongoing struggles may enable supervisors and other team members to provide more effective scaffolding, validation, and calibration of clinical judgments and patient management.","output":"Skeptical self-regulation: Resident experiences of uncertainty about uncertainty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human bocavirus (hBoV) has been identified in respiratory infections in children in a large number of studies. Despite this, the pathogenic role of the HBoV is under discussion. The main objectives of the study were: to determine the incidence of HBoV in hospitalized children; to describe the main clinical features of the positive children; and to compare the data with those from other viral infections in the same population. A prospective study was performed between 2005 and 2013 including children up to 14\\\\year old with respiratory infection admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from 3,275 patients and were tested for HBoV and other 15 respiratory viruses by RT\\\\nested PCR. HBoV was detected in 319 patients (9.9%); 80 cases as a single pathogen, and 239 cases (75%) as coinfections with other viruses. The HBoV was the fourth most common virus detected, behind respiratory syncytial virus (39.8%), rhinovirus (30.6%), and adenovirus (15%). The most common clinical diagnosis, in cases that HBoV was detected as a single pathogen was asthma exacerbation followed by pneumonia. A seasonal distribution was shown, with higher positivity rates in December and January. Children affected by HBoV were older than children infected by other viruses. Differences in terms of clinical diagnosis were found, bronchiolitis diagnosis was lower compared with the other viruses, and HBoV was associated with diagnosis of pneumonia, with increased use of antibiotics (41.8%), and radiographic infiltrates (47%).

The aim of the study was to review available data on clinical management and outcome for patients treated at Oslo University Hospital, a referral centre for echinococcosis in Norway, with special emphasis on surgical treatment. METHODS: All patients admitted with echinococcosis between January 2000 and December 2020 were identified. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively concerning patient demographics, treatment strategy, surgical procedures, complications and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients with median age 37 years (range 4-85) were identified. Sixty-eight patients (74%) were symptomatic. All patients, except for two, were immigrants to Norway and born in endemic areas. Ninety patients were diagnosed with CE and two with AE. Location of the cysts was most commonly in the liver (86%) followed by peritoneum, lungs, and spleen. All patients with active cysts were treated with albendazole. Surgical treatment was performed in 51 (56%) patients. The most common reason for abstaining from surgical treatment was that the diagnostic work-up revealed inactive cysts or interventional radiology was performed. Of the 51 patients who underwent surgery, a radical procedure was performed in 32 (64%) cases, a conservative procedure in 12 (24%), and a combination in six (12%).

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the currently available literature on the topic to determine the prevalence of mental health problems in HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published from December 2019 to August 15, 2020. We identified studies reporting the prevalence of any mental health condition in HCWs involved directly or indirectly in providing services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence proportion for individual outcome was extracted as an estimate of interest. We performed random-effects meta-analyses evaluated using Q statistic, I(2) statistic, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses and assessed study quality. This review was done in adherence to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The study protocol was registered prospectively at PROSPERO (CRD42020182005). RESULTS: We identified 1958 studies, of which 33 studies including 39703 participants (with a median = 393; range = 88C14825) were finally included for analysis. The estimated overall prevalence were as follows: depression 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9C39.3, I(2) = 99%), anxiety 32.5% (95% CI: 26.4C39.0, I(2) = 99%), insomnia or sleep disturbance 36.6% (95% CI: 36.6C48.3, I(2) = 99%), and stress 37.7% (95% CI: 24.0C52.3, I(2) = 100%).

The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least seven coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.

The eligibility of the papers was determined by two authors, who screened the results mediated by a third author. In order to facilitate the screening, the titles were divided into five sub-thematic macro-areas, namely allocation, policy, specialist, clinical trials, and technology and, when possible, per geographical area. Specifically, a posteriori, we decided to focus on the papers referring to policies and technology, as they highlighted ethical issues that are not overused and worthy of particular attention. Thus, 38 studies out of 233 met our inclusion criteria and were fully analysed. Accordingly, this review touches on themes such as fairness, equity, transparency of information, the duty of care, racial disparities, the marginalisation of the poor, and privacy and ethical concerns. Overall, it was found that despite the increased awareness of interdisciplinarity and the essential reference to ethics, many scientific articles use it with little competence, considering it only a \\"humanitarian\\" enrichment.

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of S?o Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students' educational routines and medical training.

To investigate the relationship between vaccine-induced humoral immunity and patient age, we measured antibody levels and neutralization in vaccinated sera. Sera from 13 to 17 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine were collected from health care workers at the University of Toyama (n = 740). Antibody levels were measured by the anti-receptor binding domain antibody test (anti-RBD test), and neutralization against wild-type (WT), - and -variant pseudotyped viruses were assayed using a high-throughput chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing test (htCRNT; positivity cutoff, 50% neutralization at serum dilution 1:100). Basic clinical characteristics were obtained from questionnaires. Antibodies were confirmed in all participants in both the anti-RBD test (median, 2,112 U/ml; interquartile range [IQR], 1,275 to 3,390 U/ml) and the htCRNT against WT (median % inhibition, >99.9; IQR, >99.9 to >99.9). For randomly selected sera (n = 61), 100.0% had positive htCRNT values against the - and -derived variants. Among those who answered the questionnaire (n = 237), the values of the anti-RBD test were negatively correlated with age in females (P < 0.01). An age-dependent decline in neutralization was observed against the variants but not against the wild-type virus (wild type, P = 0.09; , P < 0.01; , P < 0.01). The neutralizing activity induced by BNT162b2 was obtained not only against the wild-type virus, but also against the variants; however, there was an age-dependent decrease in the latter. Age-related heterogeneity of vaccine-acquired immunity is a concern in preventive strategies in the era dominated by variants. IMPORTANCE Since mRNA vaccines utilize wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as an antigen, there are potential concerns about acquiring immunity to variants of this virus. The neutralizing activity in BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was higher against the wild-type virus than against its variants; this effect was more apparent in older age groups. This finding suggests that one of the weaknesses of the mRNA vaccine is the high risk of variant infection in the elderly population. Because the elderly are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the age-dependent decline of neutralization against viral variants should be considered while planning vaccination programs that include boosters.","output":"Age-Dependent Reduction in Neutralization against Alpha and Beta Variants of BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Induced Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

A major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing. Herein, a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles. Using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen, sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins. Following removal of free proteins, antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. As compared to inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with the sVLPs showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection. Comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the sVLPs. The study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application; it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture.","output":"Synthetic virus-like particles prepared via protein corona formation enable effective vaccination in an avian model of coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-health could play an important role in the global response to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Clinical syndromes such as cavity effusion pose a grave threat to the life and health of the patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital after being in a coma for 6 h following accidental ingestion of a pesticide. She was treated with phencyclidine hydrochloride and pralidoxime iodide for detoxification, mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygen supply, continuous renal replacement therapy to maintain the internal environment, and hemoperfusion to promote the excretion of toxins. She also received a transfusion of red blood cells and massive fluid resuscitation. However, her blood pressure was not maintained. The patient was diagnosed with CLS due to pesticide poisoning. Oxygenation was difficult to maintain under full ventilator support; therefore, veno-venous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) treatment was given 13 h after admission. Her oxygenation level improved, but a large amount of ascites and pleural effusion soon became apparent. We continued drainage with an indwelling drainage tube, and the ECMO flow stabilized. The leakage gradually decreased, and ECMO was discontinued 3 d later. On the 6(th )day, the patient recovered from unconsciousness, but on gastroscopic evaluation, severe erosions were found in her entire stomach.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The main factor involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is inflammation. Therefore, a number of studies have indicated that periodontal disease (causes chronic inflammation) is a risk factor for the progression of atherosclerosis. The presence of periodontal pathogens has been found in human atherosclerotic plaques. A number of pathomechanisms have been demonstrated, thanks to which periodontal pathogens, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, can directly increase the progression of atherosclerosis and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Observational studies found that patients with periodontal disease were at higher risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Moreover, periodontal treatment leads to a reduction in cardiovascular risk therefore taking care of oral hygiene should be an important cardiovascular disease preventive measure. ABSTRACT: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and periodontal disease (PD) are global health problems. High frequency of ASCVD is associated with the spread of many risk factors, including poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperuricemia, excessive stress, virus infection, genetic predisposition, etc. The pathogenesis of ASCVD is complex, while inflammation plays an important role. PD is a chronic, multifactorial inflammatory disease caused by dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, causing the progressive destruction of the bone and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth. The main etiological factor of PD is the bacteria, which are capable of activating the immune response of the host inducing an inflammatory response. PD is associated with a mixed microbiota, with the evident predominance of anaerobic bacteria and microaerophilic. The red complex is an aggregate of three oral bacteria: Tannerella forsythia Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis responsible for severe clinical manifestation of PD. ASCVD and PD share a number of risk factors, and it is difficult to establish a causal relationship between these diseases. The influence of PD on ASCVD should be treated as a factor increasing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and cardiovascular events. The results of observational studies indicate that PD significantly increases the risk of ASCVD. In interventional studies, PD treatment was found to have a beneficial effect in the prevention and control of ASCVD. This comprehensive review summarizes the current knowledge of the relationship between PD and ASCVD.","output":"Unexpected Relationships: Periodontal Diseases: AtherosclerosisCPlaque Destabilization?

Ten ACE2 cooperative proteins were identified by using STRING with a high score. ACE2 expressed highly in the small intestine, testis, and kidney. The level of ACE2 expression in tumor tissues varies in different types of cancers compared with that in normal tissues. It was worth noting that the expression level of ACE2 in the tumor has no effect on patient survival.

Here, we show that cellular m6A machinery regulates host innate immunity against hepatitis B and C viral (HBV/HCV) infections by inducing m6A modification of viral transcripts. The depletion of the m6A writer enzymes (METTL3 and METTL14) leads to an increase in viral RNA recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), thereby stimulating type-I interferon production. This is reversed in cells, in which m6A METTL3 and METTL14 are overexpressed. The m6A modification of viral RNAs renders RIG-I signaling less effective, and while single nucleotide mutation of m6A consensus motif of viral RNAs, enhances RIG-I sensing activity. Importantly, m6A reader proteins (YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) inhibit RIG-I transduced signaling activated by viral RNAs by occupying m6A modified RNAs and inhibiting RIG-I recognition.

In Ireland, GPs were asked to work in a network of community assessment hubs. A focused training programme in infection control procedures/clinical use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was rapidly developed in advance. University departments of general practice were asked to develop and deliver that training. AIM: The aim of this article is to describe infection control procedure training in Ireland, the uptake by GPs and the initial experience of GPs working in this unusual environment. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two anonymous cross-sectional online surveys are sent to participants in training courses. METHOD: Survey 1 followed completion of training; survey 2 followed establishment of the hubs. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-five participants (including 439 GPs, 156 GP registrars) took part in the training. Two hundred thirty-nine (50.3%) out of four hundred seventy-five responded to Survey 1over 95% reported an increase in confidence in the use of PPE. Two hundred ten (44.2%) out of four hundred seventy-five participants responded to Survey 2; 195 had completed hub shifts. Younger, female GPs predominated. Very high levels of infection control procedures were reported. Participants commented positively on teamworking, environment and systems.

Anxiety was assessed using the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire at all periods. Logistic regression models were created to examine the pandemics association with clinically elevated mental health scores while adjusting for covariates.Results: 416 participants were assessed in early pregnancy, 373 in late pregnancy, and 370 postpartum. Time comparisons revealed mean ranks of depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher during the pandemic (p=0.02, p=0.003) only in postpartum. Unadjusted and adjusted models showed no significant association between pandemic time and scores in earlier periods. In the postpartum unadjusted model, mothers were 2.6 times more likely to report clinically elevated depression scores during the pandemic (95% CI= 1.2-5.7, p=0.02).

METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 testing program combining pooled saliva sample surveillance leading to diagnosis and intervention surveyed over 112,000 samples from 18,029 students, staff and faculty, as part of integrative efforts to mitigate transmission at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Fall 2020. RESULTS: Cumulatively, we confirmed 1,508 individuals diagnostically, 62% of these through the surveillance program and the remainder through diagnostic tests of symptomatic individuals administered on or off campus. The total strategy, including intensification of testing given case clusters early in the semester, was associated with reduced transmission following rapid case increases upon entry in Fall semester in August 2020, again in early November 2020, and upon re-entry for Spring semester in January 2021. During the Fall semester daily asymptomatic test positivity initially peaked at 4.1% but fell below 0.5% by mid-semester, averaging 0.84% across the Fall semester, with similar levels of control in Spring 2021.

METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. From March 9 to April 10, 2020, all patients referred to our institution for a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms underwent a chest CT for triage. Patients with a/parenchymal lesion characteristics of COVID-19 involving at least 50% of lung parenchyma and b/positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively included. Adrenal glands were reviewed by two independent readers to look for AAI. Additional demographics and potential biological markers of adrenal insufficiency were obtained. Correlations with ICU stay and mortality were sought. RESULTS: Out of the 219 patients with critical (n = 52) and severe lung (n = 167) parenchyma lesions, 51 (23%) had CT scan signs of AAI, which was bilateral in 45 patients (88%). Four patients had an acute biological adrenal gland insufficiency (8%).

We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa. MethodsA national surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions (DATCOV) was established. Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV-status, underlying comorbidities and their interaction on in-hospital COVID-19-associated mortality. FindingsAmong the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July and 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In particular, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of one or more comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. InterpretationThese data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes. FundingDATCOV is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African National Government. No additional funding was obtained towards the completion of this analysis and the development of this manuscript. O_TEXTBOXResearch in context Evidence before this studySince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies from Brazil, China, India, Iran, United States and several countries in Europe have identified older age, male sex and presence of underlying comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease and diabetes as risk factors for severe disease and death. There are very few studies, however, carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa, many of whom have high poverty rates, limited access to healthcare, and high prevalence of chronic communicable diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB). Data are also limited from settings with limited access to HIV treatment programmes. Early small cohort studies mainly from high income countries were not conclusive on whether HIV or TB are risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. Recent large studies from South Africas Western Cape province and the United Kingdom (UK) have found HIV-infected individuals to have a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 associated mortality. However, the UK reported risk among all confirmed cases while data from the Western Cape suggested an increase in both all confirmed cases and those admitted to hospital. Of these, only the Western Cape study presented data on mortality risk associated with presence of high viral load or immunosuppression, and found similar levels of severity irrespective of these factors. No studies reported on the interaction between HIV-infection and other non-communicable comorbidities on COVID-19 associated mortality. We performed separate literature searches on PubMed using the following terms: \\"COVID-19\\" \\"death risk factors\\" and \\"mortality\\"; \\"HIV\\" \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"mortality\\"; \\"TB\\", \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"mortality\\". All searches included publications from December 2019 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified 232 published papers. Additionally, we performed two literature searches on MedRxiv using the terms \\"HIV\\", \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"mortality\\", and \\"TB\\", \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"mortality\\" from April 25 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified six pre-prints. Added value of this studyAmong a large national cohort of over 40,000 individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in a high HIV and TB prevalence setting, we found that HIV and TB were associated with a moderately increased risk of in-hospital mortality. We found increasing risk of mortality among HIV-infected individuals with moderate/severe immunosuppression compared to those without immunosuppression. Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities was high (40%) and the effect of increasing numbers of comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. Our study included HIV-infected individuals from all provinces in the country with varying levels of access to HIV treatment programmes. Other risk factors described elsewhere in the world such as increasing age, obesity and chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) were also associated with increased mortality in this cohort. Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence suggests that HIV- and TB-infected individuals should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes, particularly those with additional comorbidities. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals.

The patient had cervical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conducted in June 2020, which depicted a remarkable decrease in swelling and hyperintensity within the cervical spinal cord with no enhancing lesions when compared with the first MRI from February 2019. In addition, the patient suffered no new relapses, an improvement regarding disability, and a reduction of the cervical spinal cord lesion size. Nonetheless, this substantial decrease does not occur on all NMOSD patients, but more awareness of the disease is needed, especially in Puerto Rico. This case illustrates the efficacy of eculizumab therapy and the importance of differentiating the clinical, histopathological, and neuroimaging characteristics that separate demyelinating autoimmune inflammatory disorders, such as NMOSD and multiple sclerosis (MS).","output":"A Case of Neuromyelitis Optica: Puerto Rican Woman with an Increased Time Lag to Diagnosis and a High Response to Eculizumab Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The ongoing pandemic has elicited an increasing interest regarding the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in saliva specimens rather than through nasopharyngeal swabs. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection through RT-qPCR based on salivary specimens compared to conventional nasopharyngeal swabs. METHODS: We reported our meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and pre-print archive medRxiv.og for eligible studies published up to June 1(st), 2020. Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review eventually retrieved 14 studies including a total of 15 estimates, the were included in quantitative synthesis. We found a pooled specificity of 97.7% (95%CI 93.8-99.2) and a pooled sensitivity of 83.4% (95%CI 73.1C90.4), with an overall agreement assessed by means of Cohens kappa equals to 0.750, 95%CI 0.62-0.88 (i.e. moderate agreement), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, diagnostic tests based on salivary specimens are somewhat reliable, but relatively few studies have been carried out. Moreover, such studies are characterized by low numbers and low sample power. Therefore, the of salivary samples is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more conventional RT-qPCR based on nasopharyngeal swabs.

The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied with a stochastic mathematical model. Methods: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, ICU requirements and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPI) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in over 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (3,298) ICU admissions and 13,447 (1,819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (33,735) total infections, 10,214 (1,649) hospitalizations, 2,121 (334) ICU admissions and 1,081(169) deaths. Conclusion: At current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by end-May.

Videos were categorized into three groups according to content as informative videos, personal experience videos, and news update videos. All videos characteristics, including the number of views, the length and duration of the video, number of likes, dislikes, and comments, were recorded. Medical information and content index (MICI) score, DISCERN score, and Global Quality Score (GQS) were calculated for each video. Results In total, 54 videos were categorized as informative videos, 46 videos were classified as patient experience videos, and 37 videos were accepted as news agency videos. The mean comment numbers were 105.6 for patient experience videos, and the difference was statistically different in favor of patient experience videos (p= 0.001). The GQS and DISCERN scores were significantly higher for the informative group in comparison with the other two groups (p=0.001 and p=0.001 for both groups).

However, difficulties with their efficiency, off-target effects, toxicity, delivery, and stability halted the development of nucleic acid-based therapeutics that can be used in the clinic. So far, only a single antisense drug, Vitravene for the treatment of CMV-induced retinitis in AIDS patients, has made it to the clinic. Since the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi), there is a renewed interest in the development of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. Antiviral RNAi approaches are highly effective in vitro and in animal models and are currently being tested in clinical trials. Here we give an overview of antiviral nucleic acid-based therapeutics.

There is no standardised approach of how this should be instituted, but principles of distributive justice are commonly used so that patients who are most likely to benefit from the drug receive it. As a result, clinical indications, in which the evidence for the drug is assumed to be established, are often prioritised over research use. In this manuscript, we present a case of a phase II investigational trial of intravenous thiamine for delirium prevention in patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to emphasise several shortcomings in the overarching prioritisation of clinical over research uses of scarce drugs. Specifically, we present the following considerations: (1) clinical use may not have stronger evidence than research use; (2) a strong scientific rationale for research use may outweigh the claim for clinical indications in which there is weak evidence; (3) treatment within the context of a clinical trial may be the standard of care; and (4) research use may not only benefit patients receiving the treatment but also offers the prospect of improving future clinical care. In summary, we argue against allocation schemes that prohibit all research uses of scarce drugs and instead recommend that allocation schemes include a balanced approach that weighs risks and benefits of access to scarce drugs irrespective of the research versus clinical use designation.","output":"Reconsidering scarce drug rationing: implications for clinical research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transplant medicine also had to face a new, hitherto unknown challenge.

Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available.

Six zoonotic NTDs were targeted: echinococcoses, trypanosomiases, leishmaniases, rabies, Taenia solium cysticercosis and leptospiroses. Invitations to fill in an online questionnaire were sent to members of francophone networks on NTDs and other tropical diseases. Results from the questionnaire were discussed during an international workshop in October 2019. The vast majority (98%) of the 171 respondents considered OH approaches relevant although only 64% had implemented them. Among respondents with OH experience, 58% had encountered difficulties mainly related to a lack of knowledge, interest and support for OH approaches by funding agencies, policy-makers, communities and researchers. Silos between disciplines and health sectors were still strong at both scientific and operational levels. Benefits were reported by 94% of respondents with OH experience, including increased intellectual stimulation, stronger collaborations, higher impact and cost-efficiency of interventions.

Though the laparoscopic Duhamel procedure is a favorable option in right-sided HD, the conventional laparoscopic technique is time consuming and has complications that are associated with the reservoir. In this study, we described a modified laparoscopic Duhamel technique with ex-anal rectal transection combined with the Deloyer's procedure for right-sided HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2010 and January 2015, 18 right-sided HD underwent this modified laparoscopic Duhamel procedure (MLDP). The main modifications were to mobilize the colon and to dissect the retrorectal space under laparoscopy, pull out, and transect ex-anally by using a linear stapling device through a transverse incision on posterior wall of the rectum. Seven age-matched patients who underwent a conventional laparoscopic Duhamel procedure (CLDP) between March 2008 and December 2010 were included as the control group. Demographics, surgical procedures, operative data, postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between these two groups. RESULTS Operative time was significantly shorter in the MLDP group (150 minutes versus 195 minutes; P = .03). There was no significant difference in mean timespan to obtain a normal defecation frequency (3.8 months versus 3.6 months), incidence of soiling (11.1% versus 14.3%; P = .34), and constipation (5.6% versus 14.3%; P = .69). Pouchitis were not found in the MLDP group, whereas 2 patients in the CLDP group (28.6%) presented with pouchitis and intractable diarrhea, requiring spur division. The incidence of postoperative enterocolitis was not significantly different in the two groups (11.1% in MLDP versus 14.3% in CLDP; P = .68). All 22 patients had a normal defecation over 4 years of age. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Duhamel with ex-anal rectal transection is a simple, easy-to-learn, and effective procedure for right-sided HD.

We investigated potential to overcome these barriers based on new developments in healthcare funding and screening and referral to prevention (SRP) in primary care based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which could guide future SRP implementation strategies. To investigate the economic need for healthcare-based SRP, we quantified hospital charges to healthcare payors for services arising from adolescent risky behaviors (e.g., substance use, risky sex). Annual North Carolina (NC) hospital charges for these services exceeded $327 M (2019 dollars), suggesting high potential for cost savings if SRP can curb hospital services associated with risky behaviors. To investigate provider barriers and facilitators, we surveyed 151 NC pediatricians and 230 NC family therapists about their attitudes regarding a recently developed well-child visit SRP with family-based prevention. Both sets of professionals reported widespread need for and interest in the SRP but cited barriers of lack of reimbursement, training, and referrals to/from each other. Physicians, but not family therapists, reported concerns with poor patient or parent compliance. Many barriers could be resolved by co-locating family therapists in pediatric clinics to conduct well-child SRP.

To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days.

Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient. METHODS: Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS: Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome. Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O(2) saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.

From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province. RESULTS: Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons).

Fear of an incursion of an unknown or incompletely understood threat can significantly limit risk tolerance. The fear may be that an incursion will affect export trade or tourism. An incomplete knowledge of the animal health situation in the exporting country, due to insufficient surveillance for the disease agent of concern, may limit the application of science in import decisions. In addition, the disease agent may be inappropriately considered exotic if it has not been described. As a result, excessive safeguards for disease agents that do not present any new threat may be employed. To confront these challenges, we are striving toward transparency in international reporting.

In France, General Practitioners (GPs) were not involved in the care organizations decision-making process before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This omission could have generated stress for GPs. We aimed first to estimate the self-perception of stress as defined by the 10-item Perceived Stress Score (PSS-10), at the beginning of the pandemic in France, among GPs from the Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, a french administrative area severely impacted by COVID-19. Second, we aimed to identify factors associated with a self-perceived stress (PSS-10  27) among socio-demographic characteristics of GPs, their access to reliable information and to personal protective equipment during the pandemic, and their exposure to well established psychosocial risk at work. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey between 8th April and 10th May 2020. The self-perception of stress was evaluated using the PSS-10, so to see the proportion of not stressed (20), borderline (21  PSS-10  26), and stressed (27) GPs. The agreement to 31 positive assertions related to possible sources of stress identified by the scientific study committee was measured using a 10-point numeric scale. In complete cases, factors associated with stress (PSS-10  27) were investigated using logistic regression, adjusted on gender, age and practice location. A supplementary analysis of the verbatims was made. RESULTS: Overall, 898 individual answers were collected, of which 879 were complete. A total of 437 GPs (49%) were stressed (PSS-10  27), and 283 GPs (32%) had a very high level of stress (PSS-10  30). Self-perceived stress was associated with multiple components, and involved classic psychosocial risk factors such as emotional requirements. However, in this context of health crisis, the primary source of stress was the diversity and quantity of information from diverse sources (614 GPs (69%, OR = 2.21, 95%CI [1.40C3.50], p < 0.001). Analysis of verbatims revealed that GPs felt isolated in a hospital-based model. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the pandemic was a source of stress for GPs.

Using radioactively or fluorescently labelled viral particles we have studied the binding and fusion kinetics and the effect of pH on binding, uptake, and fusion of ISAV to SHK-1 cells and liposomes. As pH in the medium was reduced from 7.5 to 4.5, the association of virus to the cells was nearly doubled. The same effect of pH was observed when fusion between ISAV and liposomes was analyzed. In addition, the binding of ISAV to intact SHK-1 cells and to cell membrane proteins blotted onto filters was neuraminidase sensitive. However, the increased binding induced by low pH was not neuraminidase sensitive, probably reflecting activation of a fusion peptide at low pH. By using confocal fluorescence microscopy, the increased fusion of fluorescently labelled ISAV with the plasma membrane due to low pH could be demonstrated. When vacuolar pH in the cells was raised during inoculation with chloroquine or ammonium chloride, both electron and confocal microscopy showed accumulation of ISAV in endosomes and lysosomes. Production of infectious virus could be increased by lowering the extracellular pH during infection. Furthermore, chloroquine present during virus inoculation also caused a reduction in the synthesis of viral proteins in ISAV-infected cells as well as in the production of infective virus. These results indicate that ISAV binds to sialic acid residues on the cell surface and that the fusion between virus and cell membrane takes place in the acid environment of endosomes. This provides further evidence for a high degree of similarity between ISAV and influenza virus and extends the basis for the classification of this virus as a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family.","output":"Initial events in infectious salmon anemia virus infection: evidence for the requirement of a low-pH step."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin.

Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in DENV infections occurs when a person with primary immunity is infected by a second, different DENV strain. Antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV), which emerged in the Western Hemisphere in 2015, are cross reactive with DENV and theoretically could provoke ADE in a DENV na?ve individual. CASE PRESENTATION: DENV infection was suspected in a child who had recently returned from a one-month stay in the Dominican Republic. The child presented with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in hypovolemic shock. Volume and pressor resuscitation were unsuccessful, and the child died less than 24 h after hospitalization. Laboratory results suggested an early acute first DENV infection since serum, plasma, and spinal fluid had DENV1 detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), yet the serum lacked IgG antibodies to DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of all four DENV serotypes. This acute DENV infection occurred in the presence of a remote ZIKV infection as determined by antibodies to ZIKV NS1 envelope by multiplex microsphere immunoassay and an exceptionally high plaque reduction neutralization titer to ZIKV. ZIKV IgG avidity index was high, confirming a past infection. DENV1 RNA was detected in all ten organs and tissues examined by PCR. The severe and fatal complications reported here suggest that a remote ZIKV infection may provoke an exaggerated immune response leading to hypovolemic shock when primarily infected by DENV1. CONCLUSION: We report the first known patient in the United States with a rapidly progressive and fatal case of travel-associated DENV in which prior exposure to ZIKV likely played a role in triggering an ADE phenomenon. This association of prior ZIKV immunity and subsequent new dengue infection is a worrisome phenomenon and an important contribution to the body of knowledge on immunity to flaviviruses.","output":"A fatal case report of antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus type 1 following remote Zika virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to present some cases of acute vertigo potentially related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and review the available literature about cochleovestibular dysfunction after the COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: In the period from May to July 2021, we evaluated 33 patients (mean age 54.3  14.1) with acute vertigo post COVID-19 vaccination. A detailed medical history was taken on comorbidities, types of vaccines received, and symptoms associated. All patients underwent otoneurological evaluation, such as head impulse test, nystagmus evaluation, test of skew (HINTS) examination. Head shaking test-induced nystagmus, hyperventilation-induced nystagmus, and parossistic positional nystagmus were studied to search for vestibular impairment. Results: Symptoms included 16 patients (48.5%) with objective vertigo, 14 patients (42.4%) with subjective vertigo, and 3 patients (9.1%) with dizziness. Of the associated ear, nose, and throat (ENT) symptoms, the most expressed was tinnitus (18.2%). Bedside examination showed absent nystagmus in 7 patients (21.2%), 9 patients (27.3%) had horizontal or rotatory nystagmus, 17 patients (51.5%) had a vertical or oblique nystagmus, negative HST, or central HINTS. Discussion and Conclusions: The 9 patients had an evoked nystagmus pathognomonic for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; in the remaining 17 cases, peripheral vestibular dysfunction could be excluded and central disorder may be suggested. Due to the prevalence of nystagmus of non-peripheral origin, a central nervous system involvement could not be excluded.

Study design: Data reported are from the second wave of a prospective cohort study. Methods: Online survey of 270 UK parents (conducted 4-15 October 2021). At this time, vaccination was available to 16- and 17-year-olds and had become available to 12- to 15-year-olds two weeks prior. We asked participants whose child had not yet been vaccinated how likely they were to vaccinate their child for COVID-19. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate factors associated with intention. Parents were also asked for their main reasons behind vaccination intention. Open-ended responses were analysed using content analysis. Results: Parental vaccination intention was mixed (likely: 39.3%, 95% CI 32.8%, 45.7%; uncertain: 33.9%, 27.7%, 40.2%; unlikely: 26.8%, 20.9%, 32.6%). Intention was associated with: parental COVID-19 vaccination status; greater perceived necessity and social norms regarding COVID-19 vaccination; greater COVID-19 threat appraisal; and lower vaccine safety and novelty concerns. In those who intended to vaccinate their child, the main reasons for doing so were to protect the child and others. In those who did not intend to vaccinate their child, the main reason was safety concerns. Conclusions: Parent COVID-19 vaccination and psychological factors explained a large percentage of the variance in vaccination intention for one's child.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and selected infections with different transmission routes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Health records of individuals 18 years or older who were admitted to Landspitali University Hospital (LUH) in 2016-2020 with pneumonia or MI were extracted from the hospital registry. We acquired data from the clinical laboratories regarding diagnostic testing for Chlamydia trachomatis, influenza, HIV and blood cultures positive for Enterobacterales species. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for 2020 was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and compared to 2016-2019. RESULTS: Discharge diagnoses due to pneumonia decreased by 31% in 2020, excluding COVID-19 pneumonia (SIR 0.69 (95%CI 0.64-0.75)). Discharge diagnoses of MI decreased by 18% (SIR 0.82 (95%CI 0.75-0.90)), and emergency cardiac catheterizations due to acute coronary syndrome by 23% (SIR 0.77 (95%CI 0.71-0.83)), while there was a 15% increase in blood stream infections for Enterobacterales species (SIR 1.15 (95%CI 1.04-1.28)). Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis decreased by 14.8% and positive tests decreased by 16.3%. Tests for HIV were reduced by 10.9%, while samples positive for influenza decreased by 23.6% despite doubling of tests being performed. CONCLUSION: The number of pneumonia cases of other causes than COVID-19 requiring admission dropped by a quarter in 2020. MI, chlamydia and influensa diagnoses decreased notably.

These results reveal that, besides the positive regulation function in type I interferon response at the early stage of DNA virus infection, the interferon-inducible p200 family proteins such as IFI204 could also negatively regulate the IRF7-mediated type I interferon response after RNA virus infection to avoid unnecessary host damage from hyper-inflammatory responses.","output":"P200 family protein IFI204 negatively regulates type I interferon responses by targeting IRF7 in nucleus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has made well-fitting face masks a critical piece of protective equipment for healthcare workers and civilians. While the importance of wearing face masks has been acknowledged, there remains a lack of understanding about the role of good fit in rendering protective equipment useful. In addition, supply chain constraints have caused some organizations to abandon traditional quantitative or/and qualitative fit testing, and instead, have implemented subjective fit checking. Our study seeks to quantitatively evaluate the level of fit offered by various types of masks, and most importantly, assess the accuracy of implementing fit checks by comparing fit check results to quantitative fit testing results. METHODS: Seven participants first evaluated N95 and KN95 respirators by performing a fit check. Participants then underwent quantitative fit testing wearing five N95 respirators, a KN95 respirator, a surgical mask, and fabric masks. RESULTS: N95 respirators offered higher degrees of protection than the other categories of masks tested; however, it should be noted that most N95 respirators failed to fit the participants adequately. Fit check responses had poor correlation with quantitative fit factor scores. KN95, surgical, and fabric masks achieved low fit factor scores, with little protective difference recorded between respiratory protection options. In addition, small facial differences were observed to have a significant impact on quantitative fit. CONCLUSION: Fit is critical to the level of protection offered by respirators. For an N95 respirator to provide the promised protection, it must fit the participant.

An intermediate respiratory care unit (IMCU) may be a valuable element for optimizing patient care and limited health-care resources management. We aim to assess the impact of an IMCU in the management of severe COVID-19. Methods: : Observational, retrospective study including patients admitted to the IMCU due to COVID-19 pneumonia during the months of March and April 2020. Patients were stratified based on their requirement of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and on survival status at the end of follow-up. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards method was used to assess risk factors associated with mortality. Results: : A total of 253 patients were included. Of them, 68% were male and median age was 65 years (IQR 18 years). Ninety-two patients (36.4%) required ICU transfer. Patients transferred to the ICU had a higher mortality rate (44.6% Vs 24.2%;p<0.001). Multivariable proportional hazards model showed that age 365 years (HR 4.14;95%CI 2.31-7.42;p<0.001);chronic respiratory conditions (HR 2.34;95%CI 1.38-3.99;p=0.002) and chronic kidney disease (HR 2.96;95%CI 1.61-5.43;p<0.001) were independently associated with mortality. High-dose systemic corticosteroids followed by progressive dose tapering showed a lower risk of death (HR 0.15;95%CI 0.06-0.40;p<0.001).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of offering ART initiation in the community on HIV treatment outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched databases between 1 January 2013 and 22 February 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared offering ART initiation in a community setting to offering ART initiation in a traditional health facility or alternative community setting. We assessed risk of bias, reporting of implementation outcomes, and real-world relevance and used MantelCHaenszel methods to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals. We evaluated heterogeneity qualitatively and quantitatively and used GRADE to evaluate overall evidence certainty. Searches yielded 4,035 records, resulting in 8 included studies4 RCTs and 4 observational studiesconducted in Lesotho, South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Haitia total of 11,196 PLWH. Five studies were conducted in general HIV populations, 2 in key populations, and 1 in adolescents. Community ART initiation strategies included community-based HIV testing coupled with ART initiation at home or at community venues; 5 studies maintained ART refills in the community, and 4 provided refills at the health facility. All studies were pragmatic, but in most cases provided additional resources. Few studies reported on implementation outcomes. All studies showed higher ART uptake in community initiation arms compared to facility initiation and refill arms (standard of care) (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.45; RD 30%, 95% CI 10% to 50%; 5 studies). Retention (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.54; RD 19%, 95% CI 11% to 28%; 4 studies) and viral suppression (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.49; RD 15%, 95% CI 10% to 21%; 3 studies) at 12 months were also higher in the community-based ART initiation arms. Improved uptake, retention, and viral suppression with community ART initiation were seen across population subgroupsincluding men, adolescents, and key populations. One study reported no difference in retention and viral suppression at 2 years. There were limited data on adherence and mortality. Social harms and adverse events appeared to be minimal and similar between community ART initiation and standard of care. One study compared ART refill strategies following community ART initiation (community versus facility refills) and found no difference in viral suppression (RD ?7%, 95% CI ?19% to 6%) or retention at 12 months (RD ?12%, 95% CI ?23% to 0.3%). This systematic review was limited by few studies for inclusion, poor-quality observational data, and short-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from a limited set of studies, community ART initiation appears to result in higher ART uptake, retention, and viral suppression at 1 year compared to facility-based ART initiation. Implementation on a wider scale necessitates broader exploration of costs, logistics, and acceptability by providers and PLWH to ensure that these effects are reproducible when delivered at scale, in different contexts, and over time.","output":"Effects of community-based antiretroviral therapy initiation models on HIV treatment outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical progress of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is often associated with severe pneumonia which may require intensive care, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The length of intensive care and the duration of these supportive therapies are clinically relevant outcomes. From the statistical perspective, these quantities are challenging to estimate due to episodes being time-dependent and potentially multiple, as well as being determined by the competing, terminal events of discharge alive and death. METHODS: We used multistate models to study COVID-19 patients time-dependent progress and provide a statistical framework to estimate hazard rates and transition probabilities. These estimates can then be used to quantify average sojourn times of clinically important states such as intensive care and invasive ventilation. We have made two real data sets of COVID-19 patients (n = 24* and n = 53**) and the corresponding statistical code publically available. RESULTS: The expected lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay at day 28 for the two cohorts were 15.05* and 19.62** days, while expected durations of mechanical ventilation were 7.97* and 9.85** days. Predicted mortality stood at 51%* and 15%**. Patients mechanically ventilated at the start of the example studies had a longer expected duration of ventilation (12.25*, 14.57** days) compared to patients non-ventilated (4.34*, 1.41** days) after 28 days. Furthermore, initially ventilated patients had a higher risk of death (54%* and 20%** vs. 48%* and 6%**) after 4 weeks. These results are further illustrated in stacked probability plots for the two groups from time zero, as well as for the entire cohort which depicts the predicted proportions of the patients in each state over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The multistate approach gives important insights into the progress of COVID-19 patients in terms of ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and mortality. In addition to avoiding frequent pitfalls in survival analysis, the methodology enables active cases to be analyzed by allowing for censoring. The stacked probability plots provide extensive information in a concise manner that can be easily conveyed to decision makers regarding healthcare capacities.

Viruses, including herpesviruses, have acquired functional CD200 orthologs, implying that viral exploitation of this pathway is evolutionary advantageous. However, the role that CD200R signaling plays during herpesvirus infection in vivo requires clarification. Utilizing the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model, we demonstrate that CD200R facilitates virus persistence within mucosal tissue. Specifically, MCMV infection of CD200R-deficient mice (CD200R(-/-)) elicited heightened mucosal virus-specific CD4 T cell responses that restricted virus persistence in the salivary glands. CD200R did not directly inhibit lymphocyte effector function. Instead, CD200R(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced APC accumulation that in the mucosa was a consequence of elevated cellular proliferation. Although MCMV does not encode an obvious CD200 homolog, productive replication in macrophages induced expression of cellular CD200. CD200 from hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells contributed independently to suppression of antiviral control in vivo.

The molecular mechanisms underlying MG are not fully understood. We analyzed the gene expression profile (GSE85452) and methylation profile (GSE85647) of MG samples from the GEO database to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes. By integrating the datasets, we identified 143 hypermethylation-low expression genes and 91 hypomethylation-high expression genes. Then we constructed PPI network and ceRNA networks by these genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL)1 were critical genes in both PPI networks and ceRNA networks. And potential MG associated lncRNAs were selected by comprehensive analysis of the critical genes and ceRNA networks. In the hypermethylation-low expression genes associated ceRNA network, sirtuin (SIRT)1 was the most important gene and the lncRNA HLA complex (HC) P5 had the highest connection degree. Meanwhile, PTEN was the most important gene and the lncRNA LINC00173 had the highest connection degree in the hypomethylation-high expression genes associated ceRNA network. LINC00173 was validated to be upregulated in MG patients by qRT-PCR (P = 0.005), which indicated LINC00173 might be a potential biomarker for MG.

Adapting to crisis conditions requires a rethink of traditional best practices in surgical management, delving into an area of unknown risk profiles. Key challenging areas include cancelling elective operations, modifying procedures to adapt local services and updating the consenting process. We aim to provide an ethical rationale to support change in practice and guide future decision-making. Using the four principles approach as a structure, Medline was searched for existing ethical frameworks aimed at resolving conflicting moral duties. Where insufficient data were available, best guidance was sought from educational institutions: National Health Service England and The Royal College of Surgeons. Multiple papers presenting high-quality, reasoned, ethical theory and practice guidance were collected. Using this as a basis to assess current practice, multiple requirements were generated to ensure preservation of ethical integrity when making management decisions. Careful consideration of ethical principles must guide production of local guidance ensuring consistent patient selection thus preserving equality as well as quality of clinical services. A critical issue is balancing the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19 and its associated complications. As such, the need for surgery must be sufficiently pressing to proceed with conventional or non-conventional operative management; otherwise, delaying intervention is justified.

The results indicate that affective risk perception is a significant antecedent of attitude, while cognitive risk perception was found to positively influence subjective norms. Despite the significant influence of both cognitive and affective risk perceptions on behavioural intention, affective risk perception exerts a negative influence on behavioural intention, which is in opposition to the original hypothesis. Attitude was found to be a significant mediator between affective risk perception and behavioural intention whereas subjective norms mediated the relationship between cognitive perception and behavioural intention.

Our team previously described the lipo-body lift (LBL) technique into lower duration of drainage and therefore seromas and other complications. In this study, we compared the classical body lift (CBL) technique to the LBL procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent a LBL or CBL after massive weight loss between November 2012 and October 2017 were included. Surgery outcome parameters were collected as well as patient satisfaction through a satisfaction score realized at least after 1 year postoperative. Comparisons between CBL and LBL were conducted to assess the surgery's safety and the patient's satisfaction. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were included, 61 patients who had a LBL were compared to 69 patients who had a CBL. The mean patient age was 39.64  9.97 (21-66) years old, the mean body mass index before plastic surgery was 26.83  3.08 kg/m2 (19.83-32.69), and the average weight loss was 53.40  17.37 kg. The two groups had comparable preoperative data. Duration of drainage and hospital stay was significantly lower in the LBL group than in the CBL (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Surgical outcomes were comparable between groups as well as patient satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION Lipo-body lift allows early discharge of the patient by reducing the duration of drainage without increasing the risk for complications. In our opinion, this technique should be used for type 1 and 2 patients with no contraindication for abdominal liposuction.

Within each study, we estimated the association between psychological distress assessed pre-pandemic and disruptions since the start of the pandemic to healthcare (medication access, procedures or appointments), economic activity (employment, income or working hours) and housing (change of address or household composition). Estimates were pooled across studies. Results Across the analysed data-sets, 28% to 77% of participants experienced at least one disruption, with 2.3-33.2% experiencing disruptions in two or more domains. We found 1 s.d. higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with (a) increased odds of any healthcare disruptions (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% CI 1.20-1.40), with fully adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.24 (95% CI 1.09-1.41) for disruption to procedures to 1.33 (95% CI 1.20-1.49) for disruptions to prescriptions or medication access;(b) loss of employment (odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21) and income (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 -1.19), and reductions in working hours/furlough (odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.09) and (c) increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.32) or in one domain (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.16), relative to no disruption.

The factors associated with a career plateau included having a spouse (OR = 1.394, 95%CI = 1.056C1.839), working more than 40 h per week (OR = 1.473, 95%CI = 1.146C1.893); working for 11C20 years (OR = 1.607, 95%CI = 1.150C2.246); working for more than 20 years (OR = 2.818, 95%CI = 1.938C4.097); having an average monthly income of 3001C4000 yuan (OR = 1.886, 95%CI = 1.197C2.969) or 4001C5000 yuan (OR = 2.104, 95%CI = 1.256C3.524); and reporting unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory sleep quality (OR = 1.838, 95%CI = 1.317C2.567). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers in Heilongjiang Province face a high career plateau, with marital status, weekly working hours, number of years employed, monthly average income, and sleep quality considered associated factors.

There are several solutions to design tele-presence robots, e.g., Skype and team viewer, but it is pretty inappropriate to use Skype and extra hardware. Therefore, in this article, we have presented a robust implementation of the tele-presence robot. Our proposed omnidirectional tele-presence robot consists of (i) Tricon ultrasonic sensors, (ii) Kalman filter implementation and control, and (iii) integration of our developed WebRTC-based application with the omnidirectional tele-presence robot for video transmission. We present a new algorithm to encounter the sensor noise with the least number of sensors for the estimation of Kalman filter. We have simulated the complete model of robot in Simulink and Matlab for the tough paths and critical hurdles. The robot successfully prevents the collision and reaches the destination. The mean errors for the estimation of position and velocity are 5.77% and 2.04%. To achieve efficient and reliable video transmission, the quality factors such as resolution, encoding, average delay and throughput are resolved using the WebRTC along with the integration of the communication protocols. To protect the data transmission, we have implemented the SSL protocol and installed it on the server. We tested three different cases of video resolutions (i.e., [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] ) for the performance evaluation of the video transmission. For the highest resolution, our TPR takes 3.5 ms for the encoding, and the average delay is 2.70 ms with 900  590 pixels.","output":"Implementation of Omni-D Tele-Presence Robot Using Kalman Filter and Tricon Ultrasonic Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special interest article describes a nurses labor and postpartum experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"A Nurses Personal Labor and Postpartum Experience During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary On a glorious spring day in the American Midwest, friends, colleagues, collaborators, and alumni of Prof. M.G.

The current study examined the association between level of family adult support, school adult support, and school peer support and mental wellbeing in a sample of children (age 8C15 years, N = 2,074) from schools in the UK. All three sources of support were independently associated with mental wellbeing. Analyses demonstrated a graded relationship between the number of sources of support and the odds of low mental wellbeing (LMWB), reflecting a cumulative protective effect. While all three sources of support were best, it was not vital, and analyses demonstrated a protective effect of school sources of support on LMWB amongst children with low family support. Peer support was found to be particularly important, with prevalence of LMWB similar amongst children who had high peer support (but low family and school adult support), and those who had high family and school adult support, (but low peer support), indicating that high peer support has an equivalent impact of two other protective factors.

Methods: CPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a high-flow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 L min-1 and with a turbine-driven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded (resistor) breathing. Inspiratory CO2 partial pressure (PiCO2), pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were measured at all combinations of CPAP/flows delivered, with and without the resistor. Results: Using the high-flow generator set at 40 L min-1, the PiCO2 significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH2O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle; conversely, the turbine-driven ventilator did. EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80 L min-1 but not at 120 L min-1 and with the turbine-driven ventilator.

Although the role of various cis-acting RNA elements in panhandle formation is well characterized, almost nothing is known about the potential contribution of protein cofactors to viral RNA cyclization. Proteins with nucleic acid chaperone activities are encoded by many viruses (e.g., retroviruses, coronaviruses) to facilitate RNA structural rearrangements and RNACRNA interactions during the viral replicative cycle. Since the core protein of flaviviruses is also endowed with potent RNA chaperone activities, we decided to examine the effect of West Nile virus (WNV) core on 5C3 genomic RNA annealing in vitro. Core protein binding resulted in a dramatic, dose-dependent increase in 5C3 complex formation. Mutations introduced in either the UAR (upstream AUG region) or CS (conserved sequence) elements of the viral RNA diminished core protein-dependent annealing, while compensatory mutations restored the 5C3 RNA interaction. The activity responsible for stimulating RNA annealing was mapped to the C-terminal RNA-binding region of WNV core protein.

Cardiac iron dysregulation has been recently implicated in cardiomyopathy. Here we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction on cardiac remodeling in impaired leptin signaling obese mice. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the differential gene expressions in the heart of wild-type and ob/ob mice. In particular, to investigate the roles of caloric restriction on iron homeostasis-related gene expressions, 10-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were assigned to ad libitum or calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. Male ob/ob mice exhibited LVH, cardiac inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified that an iron uptake-associated gene, transferrin receptor, was upregulated in obese ob/ob mice with LVH. Caloric restriction attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in ob/ob and db/db mice. Furthermore, we found that caloric restriction reversed iron homeostasis-related lipocalin 2, divalent metal transporter 1, transferrin receptor, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin expressions in the heart of ob/ob and db/db mice.

The purpose of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts histone levels, fibrin structure, and endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of endothelial cells. Approach We studied individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were assayed for levels of histone-DNA complexes. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate fibrin structure in clots formed from recalcified plasma samples using fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured by calibrated automated thrombin assays in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid (PCPS) or cultured human endothelial cells. Results Circulating nucleosomes were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (n=6, each group). COVID-19 patient plasma thrombin generation was also altered. Despite having an increased endogenous thrombin potential, patient plasma samples exhibited prolonged lag times and times to peak thrombin in the presence of added tissue factor and PCPS. Strikingly different results were observed when endothelial cells were used in place of tissue factor and PCPS. Control plasma samples did not generate measurable thrombin (lag time >60 min); in contrast, plasma samples from COVID-19+ patients generated thrombin (mean lag time 20 min). Consistent with the observed alterations in thrombin generation, clots from COVID-19 subjects exhibited a denser fibrin network, thinner fibers and lower fibrin resolvability. Conclusions Elevated histones, aberrant fibrin formation, and increased endothelial-dependent thrombin generation in COVID-19 may contribute to coagulopathy. HIGHLIGHTS Histone-DNA complexes are significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measures of thrombin generation by calibrated automated thrombography and fibrin clots formed in situ are altered in severe COVID-19. Plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes thrombin generation on cultured endothelial cells in the absence of added tissue factor or phospholipids.

The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue. METHODS: We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histo-cytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury. RESULTS: Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCIInegF4/80hiCD11blow macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII+F4/80hi cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCIInegF4/80hi cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII+F4/80hi cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII+F4/80hi cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury.

Only cases with short-term (42 months) and long-term (>1 year) follow-ups with digital subtraction angiograms were included. ISS was graded as mild (<25%), moderate (25-50%) or severe (>50%). The following predictors for ISS were assessed: gender, age, the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm size, location, occlusion status, and post-stenting angioplasty. RESULTS Thirty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. At mid-term follow-up, ISS was observed in 16/36 patients (44%). Eleven patients (69%) had mild ISS, three (19%) moderate, and two (12%) severe ISS. ISS was diffuse in 11 patients (69%) and focal in five patients (31%). All patients were asymptomatic. Thirteen patients were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy and three on aspirin alone. At long-term follow-up, complete ISS resolution was seen in 11 patients, improvement in three and worsening in two patients. No de novo ISS occurrence was observed. On univariate analysis there was no significant predictor for ISS. CONCLUSIONS Transient ISS after FD deployment is a common asymptomatic finding on mid-term angiographic follow-up. Complete resolution or improvement at long-term follow-up is seen in most patients who are maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy.","output":"Transient in-stent stenosis at mid-term angiographic follow-up in patients treated with SILK flow diverter stents: incidence, clinical significance and long-term follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCD II) is a common histopathological substrate of epilepsy surgery. Here, the authors propose a sulcus-centered resection strategy for this malformation, provide technical details, and assess the efficacy and safety of this technique. The main purpose of the sulcus-centered resection is to remove the folded gray matter surrounding a dysplastic sulcus, particularly that at the bottom of the sulcus. The authors also retrospectively reviewed the records of 88 consecutive patients with FCD II treated with resective surgery between January 2015 and December 2018. The demographics, clinical characteristics, electrophysiological recordings, neuroimaging studies, histopathological findings, surgical outcomes, and complications were collected. After the exclusion of diffusely distributed and gyrus-based lesions, 71 patients (30 females, 41 males) who had undergone sulcus-centered resection were included in this study. The mean ( standard deviation) age of the cohort was 17.78  10.54 years (38 pediatric patients, 33 adults). Thirty-five lesions (49%) were demonstrated on MRI; 42 patients (59%) underwent stereo-EEG monitoring before resective surgery; and 37 (52%) and 34 (48%) lesions were histopathologically proven to be FCD IIa and IIb, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 3.34  1.17 years, 64 patients (90%) remained seizure free, and 7 (10%) had permanent neurological deficits including motor weakness, sensory deficits, and visual field deficits. The study findings showed that in carefully selected FCD II cases, sulcus-centered resection is an effective and safe surgical strategy.","output":"Sulcus-centered resection for focal cortical dysplasia type II: surgical techniques and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early prediction of patients at risk of clinical deterioration can help physicians intervene and alter their clinical course towards better outcomes. In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene. Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events. The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and quick SOFA (qSOFA), commonly used in hospitals. We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while having a similar or better median detection time on all clinical events, even when using fewer features. Unlike MEWS and qSOFA, our model can be entirely automated without requiring any manually recorded features. We also show that discretization improves model performance by comparing our model to a baseline logistic regression model.","output":"EventScore: An Automated Real-time Early Warning Score for Clinical Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims Lockdown measures aimed at limiting the number of infections and deaths from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have introduced substantial psychosocial stressors in everyday life. We aimed to investigate the influence of the Dutch lockdown on cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) and investigate relations with change in mental wellbeing and experienced psychosocial stressors during the lockdown. Design Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. Setting The Netherlands, on-line between January 2019 and May 2020. Participants Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. Measurements Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre- to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre- to post-lockdown. Findings In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use [B = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-3.66, P = 0.024], but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P &lt; 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 &gt; 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10= 8.21) and families improved (P &lt; 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control. Generally, mental health problems (all Ps &gt; 0.277, all BF10 &lt; 0.139) did not change, but individual differences were significant and severity of cannabis use pre-lockdown, COVID-19-related worries, change in anxiety, expansion motives, social motives and family contact all uniquely related to variance in change in cannabis use or CUD. Conclusions While cannabis use among daily cannabis users in the Netherlands increased at the group level during the period of COVID-19 lockdown, the effect of the first months of lockdown on cannabis use disorder severity and mental wellbeing varied significantly among individual daily cannabis users.

The lack of studies makes it very difficult for clinicians to create a comprehensive framework about this complex phenomenon, particularly in comparison with other forms of intrafamilial sexual abuse, such as father-daughter incest. SSA is still underrecognized and underdisclosed but it has the potential to be every bit as harmful as sexual abuse by a parent. The topic rarely finds its way into the more general psychiatry or social work literature. It is imperative to increase healthcare practitioners' awareness of this complex subject to improve their ability to listen to, detect, and manage the disclosures of SSA in adolescent populations. This paper presents vignettes of three 13-to-15-year-old adolescent girls who disclosed SSA during inpatient hospitalization in an adolescent psychiatric and medicine department. These cases illustrate the complexity of SSA, which has been associated with a wide spectrum of both mental and physical symptoms. Adolescent victims of SSA experience serious distress, with various and numerous psychiatric manifestations, including but not limited to depression and suicide attempts, addictive behaviors, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and eating disorders. Physical symptoms should also alert practitioners: adolescent survivors are more likely to be affected by somatic complications such as sexually transmitted diseases, chronic pain, urogenital symptoms, and nutritional disorders. We offer some recommendations to improve the detection and support of distressed adolescents disclosing SSA. Listening to them and offering a protective multidisciplinary response can limit the lasting damage and contribute to the repair process.","output":"Disclosure of Sibling Sexual Abuse by Hospitalized Adolescent Girls: Three Case Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Determine the diagnostic accuracy of two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care and define individuals' characteristics providing best performance. METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). CONCLUSIONS: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of &#8805;80% sensitivity and &#8805;97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures.

The UV-visible spectroscopy study of Hc-CuONPs revealed the maximum peak at 350 nm, which proved the formation of Hc-CuONPs and FT-IR absorption peaks revealed the existence of different functional groups. The results of high-resolution TEM and X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the Hc-CuONPs have face centred cubic structure along with 40-45 nm in size. The temperature conditions of the synthesized Hc-CuONPs were spherical and circular morphologies. Furthermore, the Hc-CuONPs (IC50=5 g/ml) exhibited toxicity on cervical cancer cells (HeLa). The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the control and Hc-CuONPs-treated HeLa cells was monitored by DCFH-DA staining and the apoptotic cell death was detected by using the dual (AO/EtBr) staining, propidium iodide and DAPI staining assays. Our results from the fluorescent staining analysis evidenced that the Hc-CuONPs have inhibited the cell proliferation and promoted the apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The economy of pleasure is seen as a concept with a resource of novelty, manifesting itself in the most divergent regimes of knowledge: politics, poetry, psychoanalysis and, of course, ethics. This allows you to analyze an object from multiple disciplinary positions at once. Purely economic discourse is naturally present, but rather in a somewhat indirect form. Findings: The economy of pleasure is akin to innovative art practices in art. Its appearance can also be considered the generation of a collective traumatic experience gained by huge masses of people in the conditions of modern capitalism. The authors understand the economy of pleasure as a socio-personal creative in the economic sphere, an action with obvious humanitarian intentions. Originality/Value: The economy of pleasure is becoming a powerful lever of confidence-building in a society so badly undermined in recent decades of rampant consumption. That is why its loci will increase the level of solidarity, without which neither self-organization of society nor elementary civic activism is possible. It is this type of economic creativity that is considered in the article as a priority in the scenarios of the ?post-coronavirus? existence of the immediate future of global civilization.","output":"The Economy of Pleasure in the Era of Posthumanism: About the Metamorphoses of the Human Potential of the Near Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study shows the results of air monitoring in high- and low-occupancy rooms using two combinations of sensors, AeroTrak8220(TSI)/OPC-N3 (AlphaSense, Great Notley, UK) and OPC-N3/PMS5003 (Plantower, Beijing, China), respectively. The tests were conducted in a flat in Warsaw during the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The results showed that OPC-N3 underestimates the PN (particle number concentration) by about 2-3 times compared to the AeroTrak8220. Subsequently, the OPC-N3 was compared with another low-cost sensor, the PMS5003. Both devices showed similar efficiency in PN estimation, whereas PM (particulate matter) concentration estimation differed significantly. Moreover, the relationship among the PM1-PM2.5-PM10 readings obtained with the PMS5003 appeared improbably linear regarding the natural indoor conditions. The correlation of PM concentrations obtained with the PMS5003 suggests an oversimplified calculation method of PM. The studies also demonstrated that PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations in the high- to low-occupancy rooms were about 3, 2, and 1.5 times, respectively. On the other hand, the use of an air purifier considerably reduced the PM concentrations to similar levels in both rooms.

We selected a total of n=68,682 controls (~1:100 case-control ratio from North Carolina Medicaid member files using incidence density sampling methods. We linked Medicaid claims to the North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System to ascertain suicide and means (firearm or non-firearm). We matched cases and controls on number of months covered by Medicaid over the past 36 months. Analyses adjusted for sex, race, age, Supplemental Security Income status, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and frequency of health care encounters. RESULTS The case-control odds ratios (ccORs) for any mental health disorder were 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3, 5.2) for non-firearm suicide and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7, 2.9) for firearm suicide. There was effect measure modification by sex and race. Behavioral health diagnoses were more strongly associated with non-firearm suicides than firearm suicide in men but did not differ substantially in women.

METHODS: The topics were explored using a subset of 16 closed-ended questions from an online survey. In total, 582 participants with IDD completed the survey. The frequencies and percentages of responses to the questions were calculated, and chi-square tests performed to explore the relationship between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and responses. Given that people differed in the way in which they completed the survey, the relationship between participants' responses and completion method was also analysed. RESULTS: Participants reported that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have had a deleterious effect on their emotional well-being (around 60.0% of participants) and occupations (48.0% of students and 72.7% of workers). Although access to information and support was reportedly good overall, being under the age of 21 years and studying were associated with perceptions reflecting poorer access to information (V = .20 and V = .13, respectively) and well-being support (V = .15 and V = .13, respectively).

Anecdotally, assessment and management of looked after children have been restricted, resulting in assessment being carried out virtually by telephone or video-consultation. While changes to traditional face to face appointments were necessary enabling consultations to continue, it was unclear whether new technologies would be reliable or effective for vulnerable children.ObjectivesTo review the decision making process which informed the method for undertaking an Initial Health Assessment (IHA) for children during the Covid-19 pandemicTo determine how any gaps were mitigated within the childs health care plan.MethodsFollowing consent from individual organisations, 5C6 anonymised IHA records were randomly selected to be reviewed against an audit template from each provider across Southend, Essex and Thurrock (SET). The timeframe for the assessment was from 1st April 2020 until 30th September 2020. The data was measured against IHA pathway standards, a guide to support decision making. A table of comparative data was mapped to provide the basis for analysis.ResultsOf the five SET service providers invited to participate, four organisations provided a response within the timeframe. A total of 21 questionnaires were received. The cohort consisted of 9 females and 12 males. Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 17 years. One review was face-to-face, 4 were via video, 6 by telephone, and a further 10 recorded as virtual (unknown whether assessment was by telephone or by video-consultation). Of 11 children with no previous health review, 6 were sign-posted to the GP for a physical assessment. Similarly, 6 of the 9 children with a previous medical contact were referred to a GP. Eight children had no recorded physical follow-up.ConclusionsIt is important to recognise the inclusive data provided just a snapshot of the IHAs undertaken during this period. However, it was evident that virtual assessments appeared to become the default position without always adequately reflecting the health needs, wishes and circumstances of each individual child/young person. Whilst some IHA assessments were well completed in very uncertain and challenging circumstances, others were incomplete and lacked robust arrangements for the inclusion of a physical assessment of the child. For this reason, telephone or video-consultations should not replace face-to-face consultations. Proper planning of IHA services and resourcing for recovery is of paramount importance for every professional involved. The childs individual welfare and best interests much be central to decision making.","output":"Changes to the initial health assessment (IHA) for children entering the local authority care system during Covid-19 pandemic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To assess if physical distancing measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic can be relaxed, one of the key indicators used is the reproduction number R. Many developing countries, however, have limited capacities to estimate R accurately. This study aims to demonstrate how health production function can be used to assess the state of COVID-19 transmission and to determine a risk-based relaxation policy. METHODS: The author employs a simple bridge between epidemiological models and production economics to establish the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases as a short-run total product function and to derive the corresponding marginal product, average product, and production elasticity. Three crucial dates defining the states of transmission, labelled red, yellow, and green zones, are determined. Relaxation policy is illogical in the red zone and is not recommended in the yellow zone. In the green zone, relaxation can be considered. The Bayesian probability of near terms daily cases meeting a policy target is computed. The method is applied to France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US, and to Indonesia as an example of application in developing countries. RESULTS: This study uses data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, beginning from the first recording date for each country until February 28, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK had arrived at the green zone but with a high risk of transmission re-escalations. In the following weeks, their production elasticities were rising, giving a signal of accelerated transmissions. The signal was corroborated by these countries rising cases, making them leaving the green zone in the later months. By February 28, 2021, the UK had returned to the green zone, France, Germany, and Italy were still in the yellow zone, while the US reached the green zone at a very high number of cases. Despite being in the red zone, Indonesia relaxed its distancing measures, causing a sharp rise of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Health production function can show the state of COVID-19 transmission. A rising production elasticity gives an early warning of transmission escalations. The elasticity is a useful parameter for risk-based relaxation policy.

At present, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe consequences on both economic and social infrastructures of the developed and developing countries. Several studies have been conducted and ongoing still to design efficient models for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. The traditional diagnostic models that use reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) is a costly and time-consuming process. So, automated COVID-19 diagnosis using Deep Learning (DL) models becomes essential. The primary intention of this study is to design an effective model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. This research work introduces an automated COVID-19 diagnosis process using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a fusion-based feature extraction model, called FM-CNN. FM-CNN model has three major phases namely, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, Wiener Filtering (WF)-based preprocessing is employed to discard the noise that exists in input chest X-Ray (CXR) images. Then, the pre-processed images undergo fusion-based feature extraction model which is a combination of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRM), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). In order to determine the optimal subset of features, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed. At last, CNN is deployed as a classifier to identify the existence of binary and multiple classes of CXR images. In order to validate the proficiency of the proposed FM-CNN model in terms of its diagnostic performance, extension experimentation was carried out upon CXR dataset. As per the results attained from simulation, FM-CNN model classified multiple classes with the maximum sensitivity of 97.22%, specificity of 98.29%, accuracy of 98.06%, and F-measure of 97.93%.","output":"Automated COVID-19 diagnosis and classification using convolutional neural network with fusion based feature extraction model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, which is the cause of the current pandemic with 107,411,561 infections and 2,351,195 death worldwide so far.

Here, we show that antibody-deficient mice and immunodeficiency patients have subphysiological blood glucose concentrations. Restoring blood glucose physiology required total IgG injections and insulin-specific IgG antibodies detected in total IgG preparations and in the serum of healthy individuals. In addition to the insulin-neutralizing anti-insulin IgG, we identified two fractions of anti-insulin IgM in the serum of healthy individuals. These autoreactive IgM fractions differ in their affinity to insulin. Interestingly, the low-affinity IgM fraction (anti-insulin IgM(low)) neutralizes insulin and leads to increased blood glucose, whereas the high-affinity IgM fraction (anti-insulin IgM(high)) protects insulin from neutralization by anti-insulin IgG, thereby preventing blood glucose dysregulation. To demonstrate that anti-insulin IgM(high) acts as a protector of insulin and counteracts insulin neutralization by anti-insulin IgG, we expressed the variable regions of a high-affinity anti-insulin antibody as IgG and IgM. Remarkably, the recombinant anti-insulin IgM(high) normalized insulin function and prevented IgG-mediated insulin neutralization. These results suggest that autoreactive antibodies recognizing insulin are key regulators of blood glucose and metabolism, as they control the concentration of insulin in the blood.

We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.","output":"Cancer Biomarker Discovery: The Entropic Hallmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tree structure parameters of mangrove forests are hard to measure in the field and therefore inventories of this type of forests are impossible to keep up to date.

METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Adenoviral detection is performed by rRT-PCR with the Anyplex(?) II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) and molecular characterization was performed using a partial hexon gene sequence. 6381 samples were collected. More than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of  5 years. 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV with 1561 (79.4%) found in co-infection with at least one another respiratory virus. The most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Children under 5 were the most infected group (62.2%; 1224/1967; p <0.05). We noted that HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitudes without any clear seasonality.

This qualitative study aimed to explore and understand the experiences, beliefs and concerns of Primary Care Professionals (PCPs) regarding the preparedness and response of primary care to the first wave of the pandemic in Greece, a country where a public structured primary care system has been developing. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 33 PCPs (General Practitioners, community General Internal Medicine Specialists, community Paediatricians and nurses) recruited from all regions of Greece after the first wave of the pandemic (June 2020). Interviews were transcribed verbatim, data were anonymised and analysed. Thematic analysis was applied developing a conceptual framework. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified: a) Primary care unit adaptation and issues faced during the pandemic; b) Management of suspected COVID-19 cases; c) Management of non-suspected cases; d) Consequences of the pandemic. In the first phase of the pandemic, remote management of suspected cases and their referral to the hospital were preferred as a result of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inaccessibility to coronavirus testing in primary care. Due to the discontinuation of regular medical services and the limited in-person contact between doctors and patients, chronic disease management and prevention programmes were left behind. Social and emotional consequences of the pandemic, such as workplace stigma, isolation and social seclusion, deriving from fear of viral transmission, as well as burnout symptoms and exhaustion were commonly experienced among PCPs. Positive consequences of the pandemic were considered to be the recognition of the importance of an empowered public healthcare system by citizens and the valuable insight, knowledge and experience professionals gained in times of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care has a key role to play during and after the pandemic by using its information infrastructure to identify at-risk groups, detect new cases of COVID-19, provide care according to needs, and carry out vaccination programmes.

The first movement involves the receptor binding domain with the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain 2 and is maintained across human, bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The second is a complex network of long-range dynamics specific to SARS-CoV-2 involving the novel PRRA and the conserved KR*SF cleavage sites, as well as conserved segments in C-terminal domain 3. These movements, essential for host cell binding, are maintained by hinges conserved across human, bat, and pangolin coronaviruses glycoproteins.

In summary, we show that while recombination created a new configuration that increased the covariant dynamic movements of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, negative selection preserved its inter-domain structure throughout evolution in different hosts and inter-species transmissions.","output":"Multiple Recombination Events and Strong Purifying Selection at the Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Increased Correlated Dynamic Movements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus spread.

However, the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2-induced EMT has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induces EMT phenotypic change and stemness in breast cancer cell model and subsequently identified Snail as a modulator for this regulation. The in-depth analysis identifies the spike protein (S), but not envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), or membrane protein (M), of SARS-CoV-2 induces EMT marker changes. Suppression of Snail expression in these cells abrogates S protein-induced invasion, migration, stemness, and lung metastasis, suggesting that Snail is required for SARS-CoV-2-mediated aggressive phenotype in cancer.

These characteristics allow us to further investigate the interactions of challenging proteins like Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1). Rif1 is a crucial protein responsible for regulating different cellular processes including DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Mammalian Rif1 is yet to be fully characterized, partly because it is predicted to be intrinsically disordered for a large portion of its polypeptide. This protein has recently been the target of research as a potential biomarker in many cancers. Therefore, finding its most potent interacting partner is of utmost importance. Previous studies showed Rif1s affinity towards structured DNAs and amongst them, T(6)G(24) was superior. Recent studies have shown mouse Rif1 (muRif1) C-terminal domains (CTD) role in binding to G-quadruplexes (G4). There were many concerns in investigating the Rif1 and G4 interaction, which can be minimized using SPR. Therefore, for the first time, we have assessed its binding with G4 at nano-molar concentrations with SPR which seems to be crucial for its binding analyses. Our results indicate that muRif1-CTD has a high affinity for this G4 sequence as it shows a very low K(D) (6  1 nM).","output":"SPR Analysis of SUMO-Murine Rap1-Interacting Factor 1 C-Terminal Domain Interaction with G4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is linked to Deputy et al papers.

In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17-23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3-10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.","output":"Changes in sleep pattern, sense of time and digital media use during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and types of viral pathogens in the myocardium of patients presenting with clinically suspected myocarditis in South Africa.

To protect and enhance the ability of HCPs to perform their role in responding to COVID-19, healthcare authorities must help to alleviate the level of stress and anxiety amongst HCPs and the community. This will improve the knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19, especially for HCPs. In addition, authorities need to comply in treating this virus by implementing control measures and other precautions. This study explores the knowledge, attitude, anxiety, and preventive behaviours among Yemeni HCPs towards COVID-19. METHODS: A descriptive, web-based-cross-sectional study was conducted among 1231 Yemeni HCPs. The COVID-19 related questionnaire was designed using Google forms where the responses were coded and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software package (IBM SPSS), version 22.0. Descriptive statistics and Pearsons correlation coefficient test were also employed in this study. A p-value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant. The data collection phase commenced on 22nd April 2020, at 6 pm and finished on 26th April 2020 at 11 am. RESULTS: The results indicated that from the 1231 HCPs participating in this study, 61.6% were male, and 67% were aged between 20 and 30 years with a mean age of 29.29  6.75. Most (86%) held a bachelors degree or above having at least 10 years of work experience or less (88.1%).

During an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 with community transmission, our institution used an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our strategy comprised 3 key components: (1) enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institutions staff clinic for monitoring; (2) conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19; and (3) outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms. Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCWCHCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation. No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs. Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.","output":"Containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers: The role of surveillance, early detection, and outbreak management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases and vaccines can occasionally cause new-onset or flare of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). The adjuvanticity of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is based on either TLR-7/8 or TLR-9 agonism, which is distinct from previous vaccines and is a common pathogenic mechanism in IMDs. METHODS: We evaluated IMD flares or new disease onset within 28-days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at five large tertiary centres in countries with early vaccination adoption, three in Israel, one in UK, and one in USA. We assessed the pattern of disease expression in terms of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, or mixed disease phenotype and organ system affected. We also evaluated outcomes. FINDINGS: 27 cases included 17 flares and 10 new onset IMDs. 23/27 received the BNT - 162b2 vaccine, 2/27 the mRNA-1273 and 2/27 the ChAdOx1 vaccines. The mean age was 54.4 +/- 19.2 years and 55% of cases were female. Among the 27 cases, 21 (78%) had at least one underlying autoimmune/rheumatic disease prior the vaccination. Among those patients with a flare or activation, four episodes occurred after receiving the second-dose and in one patient they occurred both after the first and the second-dose. In those patients with a new onset disease, two occurred after the second-dose and in one patient occurred both after the first (new onset) and second-dose (flare). For either dose, IMDs occurred on average 4 days later. Of the cases, 20/27 (75%) were mild to moderate in severity. Over 80% of cases had excellent resolution of inflammatory features, mostly with the use of corticosteroid therapy. Other immune-mediated conditions included idiopathic pericarditis (n = 2), neurosarcoidosis with small fiber neuropathy (n = 1), demyelination (n = 1), and myasthenia gravis (n = 2). In 22 cases (81.5%), the insurgence of Adverse event following immunization (AEFI)/IMD could not be explained based on the drug received by the patient. In 23 cases (85.2%), AEFI development could not be explained based on the underlying disease/co-morbidities. Only in one case (3.7%), the timing window of the insurgence of the side effect was considered not compatible with the time from vaccine to flare.

Protective face shields became essential for healthcare professionals. However, most hospitals and healthcare facilities did not have them in adequate quantities. The urgency of producing and delivering face shields increased as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly multiplied. This was the situation that we encountered in the city and province of Burgos (Spain). Since there was no time to wait for a large manufacturer to produce face shields, private citizens and small companies volunteered to make them using technologies such as 3D printers. Nonprofits, citizens, and governments agencies volunteered to deliver materials to the face shield makers and to pick up and deliver the face shields to health centers and other locations where they were needed.

CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old female with no significant past medical history and confirmed Delta variant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection (Day 3), presented with a 1 day history of diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient denied respiratory symptoms and chest X-ray was clear. Lactate level was 6.3, initial troponin T 118 ng/L. Despite resuscitation, the patient significantly deteriorated in the emergency department, resulting in pulseless electrical activity arrest requiring veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Over the following 36 h, cardiac function deteriorated to near-complete left ventricular (LV) standstill. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries with slow flow. Endomyocardial biopsy showed diffuse interstitial macrophage infiltrate and small vessel thromboses. Left ventricular function did not improve over the following 7 days, and despite treatment with tocilizumab, high-dose steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin, she eventually died due to disease-related complications. DISCUSSION: Primary cardiac dysfunction secondary to COVID-19 infection is rarely reported. Little is known about the incidence, natural history, and pathophysiology of fulminant COVID-19 myocarditis. We present the most severe case of cardiac dysfunction due to COVID-19 reported in a young patient without respiratory compromise who never recovered from any cardiac function.","output":"Fulminant Delta COVID-19 myocarditis: a case report of fatal primary cardiac dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La COVID-19 est associe  un risque lev dvnement thromboembolique veineux (ETEV), thrombose veineuse profonde (TVP) et/ou embolie pulmonaire (EP) en particulier chez les patients hospitaliss.

Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic interventions that dampen and redirect inflammatory responses and, ideally, exert antiviral effects. Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite which also reprograms cell metabolism and inflammatory responses when applied exogenously. We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous application of itaconate and its variants dimethyl- and 4-octyl-itaconate (DI, 4OI) on host responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Infection induced expression of ACOD1, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis, in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by DI and 4OI treatment. In IAV-infected mice, pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1(-/-) than in wild-type mice, and DI treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and mortality. The compounds reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in human cells supporting non-productive and productive infection, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in human lung tissue. All three itaconates reduced ROS levels and STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas AKT phosphorylation was reduced by 4OI and DI but increased by itaconate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified monocytes as the main target of infection and the exclusive source of ACOD1 mRNA in peripheral blood. DI treatment silenced IFN-responses predominantly in monocytes, but also in lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ectopic synthesis of itaconate in A549 cells, which do not physiologically express ACOD1, reduced infection-driven inflammation, and DI reduced IAV- and IFN-induced CXCL10 expression in murine macrophages independent of the presence of endogenous ACOD1. The compounds differed greatly in their effects on cellular gene homeostasis and released cytokines/chemokines, but all three markedly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses. In fact, 4OI strongly inhibited viral transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the compounds reduced viral titers (4OI>Ita>DI) in A549 cells whereas viral transcription was unaffected. Taken together, these results reveal itaconates as immunomodulatory and antiviral interventions for influenza virus infection.","output":"Itaconate and derivatives reduce interferon responses and inflammation in influenza A virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia, which was named COVID-2019, emerged as a global health crisis Scientists worldwide are engaged in attempts to elucidate the transmission and pathogenic mechanisms of the causative coronavirus COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, making it critical to track and review the state of research on COVID-19 to provide guidance for further investigations Here, bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses of studies on COVID-19 were performed, including more than 1500 papers on COVID-19 available in the PubMed and CNKI databases from January 1, 2020 to March 8, 2020 In this review, we found that because of the rapid response of researchers worldwide, the number of COVID-19-related publications showed a high growth trend in the first ten days of February;among these, the largest number of studies originated in China, the country most affected by pandemic in its early stages Our findings revealed that the epidemic situation and data accessibility of different research teams have caused obvious difference in emphases of the publications Besides, there was an unprecedented level of close cooperation and information sharing within the global scientific community relative to previous coronavirus research We combed and drew the knowledge map of the SARS-CoV-2 literature, explored early status of research on etiology, pathology, epidemiology, treatment, prevention, and control, and discussed knowledge gaps that remain to be urgently addressed Future perspectives on treatment, prevention, and control were also presented to provide fundamental references for current and future coronavirus research","output":"Early Research on COVID-19: A Bibliometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the suspension of face-to-face classes and a considerable increase in the use of telepractice services in speech-language pathology. However, little is known about parents' and students' satisfaction with telepractice services and their preferences for different service delivery modes. These factors may affect therapy effectiveness and the future adoption of telepractice. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated students' and parents' perceptions of telepractice efficacy and their preferences for different service delivery modes (ie, on-site practice vs telepractice). We also identified factors that affect parents' and students' preferences for different service delivery modes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 19-question survey on telepractice satisfaction and preferences was administered to 41 Hong Kong Chinese students and 85 parents who received telepractice services from school-based speech-language pathologists during the COVID-19 class suspension period. In addition to providing demographic information and data on the implementation of telepractice services, all participants were asked to rate their perceptions of the efficacy of telepractice services and compare on-site practices to telepractice on a 5-point Likert scale (ie, 1=strongly disagree/prefer the use of on-site speech-language therapy services and 5=strongly agree/prefer the use of telepractice services). RESULTS: Despite the fact that telepractice efficacy was highly rated by parents (95% CI 3.30-3.66) and students (95% CI 3.21-3.76), both groups believed that telepractice was less effective than on-site practices (parents: 95% CI 2.14-2.52; students: 95% CI 2.08-2.65). Moreover, parents preferred on-site practices over telepractice (95% CI 2.04-2.43), whereas students did not prefer one mode of practice over the other (95% CI 2.74-3.41). A significant association between telepractice efficacy and a preference for telepractice services was found only among the students (&#964;=.43, P<.001), not the parents (&#964;=.07; P=.44). CONCLUSIONS: Although telepractice is an acceptable alternative service delivery option for providing speech and language therapy services to school-aged individuals, speech-language therapists and parents must play a more proactive role in telepractice services to facilitate effective communication between clinicians and parents.","output":"Parents' and Students' Perceptions of Telepractice Services for Speech-Language Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission is a possible infection route of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This investigation focuses on the airborne infection risk of COVID-19 in a nursing unit in an inpatient building in Shenzhen, China. On-site measurements and questionnaire surveys were conducted to obtain the air change rates and occupant trajectories, respectively. The aerosol transport and doseCresponse models were applied to evaluate the infection risk. The average outdoor air change rate measured in the wards was 1.1 h?1, which is below the minimum limit of 2.0 h?1 required by ASHRAE 170C2021. Considering the surveyed occupant behavior during one week, the patients and their attendants spent an average of 19.4 h/d and 15.1 h/d, respectively, in the wards, whereas the nurses primarily worked in the nurse station (3.0 h/d) and wards (2.4 h/d). The doctors primarily worked in their offices (2.6 h/d) and wards (1.1 h/d). Assuming one undetected COVID-19 infector emitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nursing unit, we calculated the accumulated viral dose and infection probabilities of the occupants. After one week, the cumulative infection risks of the patients and attendants were almost equal (0.002), and were higher than those of the nurses (0.0013) and doctors (0.0004). Proper protection measures, such as reducing the number of attendants, increasing the air change rate, and wearing masks, were found to reduce the infection risk. It should be noted that the reported results are based on several assumptions, such as the speculated virological properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the particular trajectories of occupants. Moreover, only second generations of transmission were taken into consideration, whereas in reality, the week-long exposure may cause third generation of transmission or worse.","output":"Airborne infection risk assessment of COVID-19 in an inpatient department through on-site occupant behavior surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic claimed millions of lives and caused unprecedented disruptions.

For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly.","output":"Quantum-Like Interdependence Theory Advances Autonomous HumanCMachine Teams (A-HMTs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Crowded indoor environments, such as households, are high-risk settings for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses. Data Source: PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission. Study Selection: All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses. Results: A total of 54 relevant studies with 77a?758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%), to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%).

METHOD: Phytochemical isolation of CS extracts was firstly carried out and 14 potential bioactive compounds were obtained. Chemical fingerprinting was performed on 27 batches of CS from different sources by HPLC, and further analysed by similarity analysis (SA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Pharmacodynamic testing was performed in CCl4-induced acute liver injury cell model to assess the hepatoprotective activity of CS by measuring the cell viability and levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Bivariate correlations analysis (BCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) were used to analyse the spectrum-effect relationships of CS.

The patient underwent ECG, chest radiology, and ultrasound, where the patient was found to have right pleural effusion while his ECG was normal. In the history taken from the patient, he had no underlying disease, no history of heart diseases in his family. For a better diagnosis, ETT and aortic CT angiography was performed on the patient which confirmed the evidence of dissection. Immediately after the diagnosis, necessary arrangements were made for open heart surgery and the patient was prepared for surgery. The patient was admitted in the cardiac surgery ICU for 5 days and his medication was carefully administered. After the conditions were stabilized, the patient was transferred to the post-cardiac surgery ICU ward. The patient was discharged from the hospital one week after the surgery and returned to the office as an OPD one week after his discharge. CONCLUSION: Various risk factors can play a role in creating aortic dissection. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to patients history for achieving a quick and definitive diagnosis.

Results: Our study revealed that the prevalence of workaholism was 33%; 32.8% and 33.7% were listed for the faculties of Medicine and Arts, respectively. After the COVID-19 pandemic, workaholic frequency was significantly increased to be 46.4%. Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that workaholism had negatively impacted sleep in terms of difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and insufficient sleep. Conclusion: The prevalence of workaholism appears to be high among university staff members especially after COVID-19 crisis. Sleep problems were linked to workaholics more than other workers. We recommend encouraging employees to work to their contracted hours, as excess work over extended periods may have adverse effects not only on organizational productivity but also on their health.","output":"Workaholism, sleep disorders, and potential e-learning impacts among Menoufia University staff during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fped.2021.762684.].","output":"Corrigendum: Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy on Infant Neurobehavioral Development: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used three comprehensive datasets to assess economic activities at as granular a level as possible for Support Activities for Forestry industry in Mississippi in 2019.

This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as 1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in 1 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08C2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35C4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was 2 weeks for all viruses and detections of 3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.","output":"Community Surveillance of Respiratory Viruses Among Families in the Utah Better Identification of Germs-Longitudinal Viral Epidemiology (BIG-LoVE) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of perinatal stroke in Beijing. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study included all the live births from 17 representative maternal delivery hospitals in Beijing from March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020. Neonates with a stroke were assigned to the study group. Clinical data, including general information, clinical manifestations, and risk factors, were collected. Up until 18 months after birth, neonates were routinely assessed according to the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and/or the Bayley scale. Statistical analysis was done using the chi-squared, t-tests, and logistic regression analysis using SPSS version 26.0. OUTCOMES: In total, 27 cases were identified and the incidence of perinatal stroke in Beijing was 1/2,660 live births, including 1/5,985 for ischemic stroke and 1/4,788 for hemorrhagic stroke. Seventeen cases (62.96%) of acute symptomatic stroke and convulsions within 72 h (10 cases, 37.04%) were the most common presentations. Ten patients showed no neurological symptoms and were found to have had a stroke through routine cranial ultrasonography after being hospitalized for non-neurological diseases. The risk factors include primiparity, placental or uterine abruption/acute chorioamnionitis, intrauterine distress, asphyxia, and severe infection. In the study group, 11.1% (3/27) of patients had adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The patients in the study group had lower scores for the ASQ than those in the control group in the communication, gross, and fine motor dimensions. CONCLUSION: The incidence of perinatal stroke in Beijing was consistent with that in other countries. Routine neuroimaging of infants with risk factors may enable identification of asymptomatic strokes in more patients. Patients who have suffered from a stroke may have neurological sequelae; therefore, early detection, treatment, and regular follow-ups are beneficial for improving their recovery outcomes.","output":"The Incidence and Characteristics of Perinatal Stroke in Beijing: A Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer cells are characterized by metabolic alterations.

However, its role in the metabolic process of gastric cancer remains largely unexplored. In this study, by in vitro, in vivo and in silico assessments, our results revealed that SCD1 exhibited the ability to promote tumor growth, migration and anti-ferroptosis of gastric cancer. The underlying mechanism might involve the alteration of cancer stemness and modulation of cell cycle-related proteins.

To understand AMs role in airway disease development, we examined the influence of Secretoglobin family 1a member 1 (SCGB1A1), a pulmonary surfactant protein, on AM development and function. In a murine model, high-throughput RNA-sequencing and gene expression analyses were performed on purified AMs isolated from mice lacking in Scgb1a1 gene and were compared with that from mice expressing the wild type Scgb1a1 at weaning (4 week), puberty (8 week), early adult (12 week), and middle age (40 week). AMs from early adult mice under Scgb1a1 sufficiency demonstrated a total of 37 up-regulated biological pathways compared to that at weaning, from which 30 were directly involved with antigen presentation, anti-viral immunity and inflammation. Importantly, these pathways under Scgb1a1 deficiency were significantly down-regulated compared to that in the age-matched Scgb1a1-sufficient counterparts. Furthermore, AMs from Scgb1a1-deficient mice showed an early activation of inflammatory pathways compared with that from Scgb1a1-sufficient mice. Our in vitro experiments with AM culture established that exogenous supplementation of SCGB1a1 protein significantly reduced AM responses to microbial stimuli where SCGB1a1 was effective in blunting the release of cytokines and chemokines (including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1a, TNF-a, and MCP-1).

This post hoc analysis investigates the association of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with the outcome in this vulnerable patient group. METHODS: The COVIP study is a prospective international observational study that recruited ICU patients  70 years admitted with COVID-19 (NCT04321265). Several parameters including ADL (ADL; 0 = disability, 6 = no disability), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), SOFA score, intensive care treatment, ICU- and 3-month survival were recorded. A mixed-effects Weibull proportional hazard regression analyses for 3-month mortality adjusted for multiple confounders. RESULTS: This pre-specified analysis included 2359 patients with a documented ADL and CFS. Most patients evidenced independence in their daily living before hospital admission (80% with ADL = 6). Patients with no frailty and no disability showed the lowest, patients with frailty (CFS  5) and disability (ADL < 6) the highest 3-month mortality (52 vs. 78%, p < 0.001). ADL was independently associated with 3-month mortality (ADL as a continuous variable: aHR 0.88 (95% CI 0.82C0.94, p < 0.001). Being disable resulted in a significant increased risk for 3-month mortality (aHR 1.53 (95% CI 1.19C1.97, p 0.001) even after adjustment for multiple confounders. CONCLUSION: Baseline Activities of Daily Living (ADL) on admission provides additional information for outcome prediction, although most critically ill old intensive care patients suffering from COVID-19 had no restriction in their ADL prior to ICU admission.

Substance use amongst adolescents is increasing in South Africa, and limited research on frequency, risk and protective factors means that prevention interventions are difficult to design. This paper aims to describe and discuss factors associated with substance use among school-going adolescents in three peri-urban South African settings. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using baseline data from participants in the Girls Achieve Power (GAP Year) trial. Grade 8 learners (N=2383), aged 11-18, were recruited from 26 lowest quintile public high schools in three townships: Soweto and Thembisa in Gauteng Province, and Khayelitsha in Western Cape Province. A baseline survey gathered demographic and behavioural data. Questions relevant to substance use and social support were used for this analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with substance use. The final variables were included in an unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression for current substance use, and a multinomial logistic regression for frequency of substance use. Results: A total of 22.5% (534) of participants indicated they had ever used substances. Being male was strongly associated with substance use (P<0.001), and less strongly with frequency of substance use. Age significantly predicted substance use, with older adolescents being more likely to engage in substance use (P<0.001); having a parent/guardian employed was negatively associated with substance use (P=0.021). Family-related social support variables were predictive of substance use. Being able to count on friends when things went wrong was predictive of lower frequency of substance use (P=0.019). Conclusions: These results can inform the targeting of prevention interventions to males and younger learners, as well as ensuring youth interventions build family and peer support to make substance use less likely and less frequent.","output":"Socio-demographic and social support factors related to substance use in South African in-school adolescents: Insights from the Girls Achieve Power (GAP Year) trial in three peri-urban settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Bedside lung sonography is recognized as a reliable diagnostic modality in trauma settings due to its ability to detect alterations both in lung parenchyma and in pleural cavities. In severe blunt chest trauma, lung ultrasound can identify promptly life-threatening conditions which may need direct intervention, whereas in minor trauma, lung ultrasound contributes to detection of acute pathologies which are often initially radio-occult and helps in the selection of those patients that might need further investigation. Topic Description: We did a literature search on databases EMBASE, PubMed, SCOPUS and Google Scholar using the terms 'trauma', 'lung contusion', 'pneumothorax', 'hemothorax' and 'lung ultrasound'. The latest articles were reviewed and this article was written using the most current and validated information. Discussion: Lung ultrasound is quite accurate in diagnosing pneumothorax by using a combination of four sonographic signs; absence of lung sliding, B-lines, lung pulse and presence of lung point. It provides a rapid diagnosis in hemodynamically unstable patients. Lung contusions and hemothorax can be diagnosed and assessed with lung ultrasound. Ultrasound is also very useful for evaluating rib and sternal fractures and for imaging the pericardium for effusion and tamponade.

Outpatient maintenance hemodialysis seems to entail an increased risk of contagion, and previous reports inform of increased mortality among this population. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory parameters, outcomes, and management once discharged of CKD-5D patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from our health area. RESULTS Out of the 429 CKD-5D population, 36 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (8%): 34 on in-center hemodialysis and 2 on peritoneal dialysis. Five were asymptomatic. The most common symptom was fever (70%), followed by dyspnea and cough. History of cardiovascular disease and elevation of LDH and C-reactive protein during admission were associated with higher mortality. Thirteen patients died (36%), 8 patients were admitted to an ICU, and survival was low (38%) among the latter. The mean time to death was 12 days. Most discharged patients got negative rRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs within 26 days of diagnosis. However, there is a portion of cured patients that continue to have positive results even more than 2 months after the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS Patients on dialysis have an increased mortality risk if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Preventive measures have proven useful. Thus, proper ones, such as universal screening of the population and isolation when required, need to be generalized.

These were first isolated in humans as causal microorganisms responsible for common cold. The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS epidemic (64 countries affected) caused by MERS-CoV showed their acute and fatal side. These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet. Although we have not yet understood completely these two CoV epidemics, a third most dangerous and severe CoV infection has been originated in the Wuhan city, Hubei district of China in December 2019.

This provides opportunities to develop new models and approaches. Exploring a collective capability approach could be one way to inform an Indigenist evaluation methodology. Collective capability suggests that a base of skills and knowledges exist, and when these assets come together, empowerment and agency emerge. However, collective capability requires defining as it is not common terminology in population health or evaluation. Our aim is to define the concept of collective capability in Indigenist evaluation in Australia from an Australian Indigenous standpoint. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A modified Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis will be used to define collective capability in an Australian Indigenous evaluation context, and to systematically review and synthesise the literature. Approximately 20 qualitative interviews with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge holders will clarify the meaning of collective capability and inform appropriate search strategy terms with a consensus process then used to code the literature. We will then systematically collate, synthesise and analyse the literature to identify exemplars or models of collective capability from the literature. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The protocol has approval from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Ethics Committee, approval no. EO239-20210114. All knowledge holders will provide written consent to participate in the research. This protocol provides a process to developing a concept, and will form the basis of a new framework and assessment tool for Indigenist evaluation practice.

Currently, research on these persistent symptoms mainly focuses on patients with severe infections (managed in an inpatient setting) whereas patients with mild disease are rarely studied. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this systematic review was to create an overview of the nature and frequency of persistent symptoms experienced by patients after mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychINFO on 2 February 2021. Quantitative studies, qualitative studies, clinical lessons and case reports were considered eligible designs. RESULTS: In total, nine articles were included in this literature review. The frequency of persistent symptoms in patients after mild COVID-19 infection ranged between 10% and 35%. Symptoms persisting after a mild COVID-19 infection can be distinguished into physical, mental and social symptoms. Fatigue was the most frequently described persistent symptom. Other frequently occurring persistent symptoms were dyspnoea, cough, chest pain, headache, decreased mental and cognitive status and olfactory dysfunction. In addition, it was found that persisting symptoms after a mild COVID-19 infection can have major consequences for work and daily functioning. CONCLUSION: There is already some evidence that symptoms of mild COVID-19 persist after 3 weeks in a third of patients.

HIV-1 patients benefit from a coinfection with GB Virus C (GBV-C), since HIV-positive individuals with long-term GBV-C viraemia show better survival rates than HIV-1 patients without persisting GBV-C. A direct influence of GBV-C on HIV-1 replication has been shown in coinfection experiments. GBV-C is a human non-pathogenic member of the flaviviridae family that can replicate in T and B cells. Therefore, GBV-C shares partly the same ecological niche with HIV-1. In earlier work we have demonstrated that recombinant glycoprotein E2 of GBV-C and peptides derived from the E2 N-terminus interfere with HIV entry. In this study we investigated the underlying mechanism. Performing a virus-cell fusion assay and temperature-arrested HIV-infection kinetics, we provide evidence that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides interfere with late HIV-1 entry steps after the engagement of gp120 with CD4 receptor and coreceptor. Binding and competition experiments revealed that the N-terminal E2 peptides bind to the disulfide loop region of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41. In conjunction with computational analyses, we identified sequence similarities between the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120. This similarity appears to enable the GBV-C E2 N-terminus to interact with the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide loop, a crucial domain involved in the gp120-gp41 interface.

Despite the fact that bats carry and shed highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, Nipah and SARS, they rarely display clinical symptoms of infection. Host factors influencing viral replication are poorly understood in bats and are likely to include both pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. MicroRNAs are a major mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation, however very little is known about them in bats. RESULTS: This study describes 399 microRNAs identified by deep sequencing of small RNA isolated from tissues of the Black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, a confirmed natural reservoir of the human pathogens Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Of the microRNAs identified, more than 100 are unique amongst vertebrates, including a subset containing mutations in critical seed regions. Clusters of rapidly-evolving microRNAs were identified, as well as microRNAs predicted to target genes involved in antiviral immunity, the DNA damage response, apoptosis and autophagy. Closer inspection of the predicted targets for several highly supported novel miRNA candidates suggests putative roles in host-virus interaction. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are likely to play major roles in regulating virus-host interaction in bats, via dampening of inflammatory responses (limiting the effects of immunopathology), and directly limiting the extent of viral replication, either through restricting the availability of essential factors or by controlling apoptosis. Characterisation of the bat microRNA repertoire is an essential step towards understanding transcriptional regulation during viral infection, and will assist in the identification of mechanisms that enable bats to act as natural virus reservoirs. This in turn will facilitate the development of antiviral strategies for use in humans and other species.

ANIMALS 8 healthy Coonhound-cross dogs (mean  SD weight, 27.2  1.6 kg). PROCEDURES Thoracic CT of each dog was performed before placement of a TT and daily thereafter for 7 days. Thoracic fluid volume was calculated from CT images. Effusion was aspirated when detected; volume was recorded, and cytologic analysis and bacterial culture were performed. RESULTS Mean  SD volume of pleural effusion detected by CT was 1.43  0.59 mL/kg (range, 0.12 to 3.32 mL/kg). Mean volume collected via aspiration was 0.48  0.84 mL/kg (range, 0 to 2.16 mL/kg). Cytologic analysis yielded results consistent with an exudate, characterized by septic suppurative inflammation in 6 dogs and mixed inflammation in 1 dog; there was insufficient volume for analysis in 1 dog. Sufficient volume was obtained for bacterial culture for 6 dogs, which yielded pure growths of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 3) and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (2) and mixed growth of both of these species (1). The TT was removed before day 7 in 4 dogs because of pyothorax (n = 3) and irreversible damage to the TT (1). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Presence of a TT induced a minimal volume of pleural effusion in healthy dogs. Pyothorax developed in most dogs between 4 and 6 days after TT placement. On the basis of these findings, a TT should be removed by the fourth day after placement, unless complications are detected sooner.","output":"Quantification and characterization of pleural fluid in healthy dogs with thoracostomy tubes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City's medical schools experienced dramatic disruptions in every aspect of medical education.

What allowed each school to navigate these treacherous waters was a set of guiding principles that were used to ground each conversation, and inform every decision. While the language varied somewhat between schools, the core principles were universal and framed a way forward at a time when information, data, precedent, and best practices did not exist. The authors share these guiding principles in the hope that colleagues at other medical schools will find them to be a useful framework as we all continue to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on the future of medical education.","output":"Guiding principles for undergraduate medical education in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This pilot quality improvement project implemented an adapted screening tool within an outpatient oncology center for patients with advanced cancer to identify unmet patient needs, aid decision making, and increase the number of patients referred to palliative care.

Alongside this, however, vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis has emerged. Previously, our team reported in the Lsio-Louna-Lfini Nature Reserve (Republic of Congo) the presence of a new Enterovirus C (Ibou002) in a male gorilla that was put away because of clinical symptoms of facial paralysis. This new virus, isolated was from the stool samples of this gorilla but also from the excrement of an eco-guardian, is very similar to Coxsackievirus (EV-C99) as well as poliovirus 1 and 2. We hypothesised that these symptoms might be due to poliovirus infection. To test our hypothesis, we developed and optimised a non-invasive immunoassay for the detection of Enterovirus-specific antibodies in gorilla faeces that could be useful for routine serosurveillance in such cases. Methods: In order to assess the potential role of poliovirus infection, we have developed and optimised a protocol, based on the lyophilisation and solubilisation of small volumes of stool extracts from 16 gorilla and 3 humans, to detect specific antibodies by western blot and ELISA. Results: First, total immunoglobulins were detected in the concentrated stool extracts. Specific antibodies were then detected in 4/16 gorilla samples and 2/3 human samples by western blot using both the polio vaccine antigen and the Ibou002 antigen and by ELISA using the polio vaccine antigen. Humoral responses were greater with the Ibou002 antigen. Conclusion: We therefore suggest that this recombinant virus could lead to a polio-like disease in the endangered western lowland gorilla. The development of a non-invasive approach to detect microorganism-specific immunoglobulins from faecal samples opens numerous prospects for application in zoonotic infectious diseases and could revolutionise the screening of animals for important emerging infections, such as Ebola fever, rabies and coronavirus infections.","output":"Stool Serology: Development of a Non-Invasive Immunological Method for the Detection of Enterovirus-Specific Antibodies in Congo Gorilla Faeces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial enzymes catalyze various reactions inside and outside living cells.

METHODS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, we conducted an online survey and collected data from 3000 representative Chinese Internet users. The study measured COVID-19 knowledge as a dependent variable, fact-checking habit as an independent variable, and general science knowledge and negative emotion as moderators. Internet use and several demographic factors were used as control variables. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between fact-checking habit and COVID-19 knowledge as a function of science knowledge and negative emotion. RESULTS: Fact-checking habit was negatively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, and the relationship was moderated by general science knowledge and negative emotion. For those with less science knowledge or higher levels of negative emotion, COVID-19 knowledge was lower with the increase of experience in fact-checking. CONCLUSIONS: During a pandemic, individuals may not be able to obtain high-quality information, even if they regularly fact-check information, and especially when they lack knowledge about science or are influenced by negative emotion.

After over 160 million cases and 3.3 million deaths worldwide as of May 2021, it is still unclear when this crisis will end. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that improve the prognosis of seriously affected patients. Multiple viruses including HIV, MERS-CoV (coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS), SARS-CoV (coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 use a mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA pseudoknotted structure that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified small molecules as antiviral agents that can bind to the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. Targeting -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 can be an excellent strategy to impair viral replication and improve patients' prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in -1 PRF pseudoknots of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. We provide in-depth analysis on alternative structure prediction methods based on SARS-CoV-2 structural reactivity (SHAPE) data to contextualize and motivate future RNA structure-function research.

When there are significant shifts in the environment, the brain and body engage a set of physiological and behavioral countermeasures collectively known as the stress response. These responses, which include changes at the cellular, systems, and organismal level, are geared toward protecting homeostasis and adapting physiological operating parameters so as to enable the organism to overcome short-term challenges. It is the shift of these well-organized acute responses to dysregulated chronic responses that leads to pathologies. In a sense, the protective measures become destructive, causing the myriad health problems that are associated with chronic stress. To further complicate the situation, these challenges need not be purely physical in nature. Indeed, psychosocial stressors such as ruminating about challenges at work, resource insecurity, and unstable social environments can engage the very same emergency threat systems and eventually lead to the same types of pathologies that sometimes are described as burnout in humans. This short review focuses on very recent empirical work exploring the effects of chronic stress on key brain circuits, metabolism and metabolic function, and immune function.","output":"BrainCbody responses to chronic stress: a brief review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare students (HCSs) represent a target category for seasonal flu vaccination.

Data on adherence, knowledge, perception, and attitude were investigated through an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was filled out by 352 out of 392 third-year HCSs (response rate = 90%). The main reason for refusal was the perception of influenza as non-threatening (24.4%), while self-protection was the main reason for adherence (87.5%).

Although many components of medical education were adaptable to that format, anatomical dissection laboratory lost substantial content in that conversion, including features of active student participation, three-dimensional spatial relationships of structures, and the perception of texture, variation, and scale. The present study aimed to develop and assess online anatomy laboratory sessions that sought to preserve benefits of the dissection experience for first-year medical students. The online teaching package was based on a novel form of active videography that emulates eye movement patterns that occur during processes of visual identification, scene analysis, and learning. Using this video-image library of dissected materials, content was presented through asynchronous narrated laboratory demonstrations and synchronous/active video conference sessions and included a novel, video-based assessment tool. Data were obtained using summative assessments and a final course evaluation. Test scores for the online practical examination were significantly improved over those for previous in-person dissection-based examinations, as evidenced by several measures of performance (Mean: 2015-2019: 82.5%; 2020: 94.9%; P = 0.003). Concurrently, didactic test scores were slightly, but not significantly, improved (Mean: 2015-2019: 88.0%; 2020: 89.9%).

We aimed to further describe the natural history, prognostic factors, humanistic burden and uptake of traditional and alternative therapies in patients with CSU. METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional analysis at a single centre. We reviewed patient medical records and conducted a survey in patients with CSU. RESULTS: 72 patients participated in the study with a median duration of CSU of 48 months. 30% of patients had symptoms that resolved in under 2 years with these patients trending towards an older age of onset of CSU (48  17 years). 16% of patients had symptoms lasting 10 years or longer with these patients trending towards a younger age of onset (22  16 years). Patients with a relapsing/remitting disease course (31%) and those with co-existing angioedema (57%) trended towards a longer median duration of CSU (96 and 50 months respectively) and were observed to have a higher proportion of patients reporting CSU duration of 10 years or longer (33% and 25%, p = 0.033 and p = 0.036 respectively). Patients with co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease (19%) trended towards a shorter median duration of CSU (37 months). 54 patients (75%) reported sleep disturbance and 29 patients (43%) required emergency room visit(s) for symptomatic control. 84% of patients who trialed second generation antihistamines reported a response to treatment, while 73% of patients who trialed omalizumab reported a response to treatment. Patients using alternative medicine such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathic medicine had lower reported response rates (20C29%) to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of CSU may be longer than previously reported with our study finding a median duration of symptoms of nearly 4 years with one-third of patients reporting a relapsing/remitting disease course. Younger age of onset, a relapsing/remitting disease course and angioedema may predict a longer duration of CSU, whereas older age of onset and co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease may predict a shorter duration of CSU.

Some health care workers transitioned to working from home while many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data was collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020. RESULTS A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time (TST) shortened in those continuing to work in-person (p<.001), whereas TST was unchanged in those working from home (p=.73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced TST and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood. CONCLUSIONS Health care workers' mood worsened regardless of whether work was in person or remote, though TST was shorter for those working in person. Those working from home perhaps shifted sleep time to be more in line with endogenous circadian phase. Peer or other support services may be indicated to address sleep, mood, and health behaviors among health care workers during these unprecedented times.","output":"The effects of COVID-19 stay-at-home order on sleep, health, and working patterns: a survey study of United States health care workers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Early detection and management of community acquired Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) can reduce associated morbidity and mortality particularly in low and low middle-income countries where infrastructure for laboratory tests is limited and renal replacement therapy is largely unavailable. We have established a collaborative project between the Renal Unit of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital and the Renal Department of Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, supported by the International Society of Nephrology aiming at investigating the use of point of care (POC) Creatinine (Cr) for early identification and management of community acquired AKI. The first part of the study evaluated the accuracy of POC Cr technology by comparison with the central laboratory standard Cr assay used at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital and showed good overall correlation with mean bias of 27.2 umol/L concluding that POC Cr > 150 umol/L reflects AKI in the absence of known chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here we present the second part of the study investigating the use of POC Cr in the Emergency Department (ED) and the third part, that was formulated with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, assessing the POC Cr technology in the COVID-19 isolation centres. Methods: The second part of this study was conducted at the ED of University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) between January and December 2020. Adult patients were screened by Nephrology residents with POC Cr using a capillary sample (fingerstick) with the NOVA Stasensor Xpress Cr analyser if there was clinical suspicion of community acquired AKI. The third part of this study was that of the use of POC Cr as screening tool to evaluate AKI in COVID-19 patients at 2 COVID-19 isolation centres in Rivers state. Data were extracted from the case notes of the patients and a proforma designed for the study. Results: In the second stage, between January and December 2020, 53 patients aged 4819 with clinical suspicion of community acquired AKI were screened with POC Cr in the ED;45.3% were females, 5.7% had known chronic kidney disease and 75.5% had suspected infection and/or hypovolaemia. 21 out of 53 patients (39.6%) had POC Cr > 150 umol/L and 18 out 50 (36%) were attributed to AKI. In the third stage, 69 patients aged 3814 diagnosed with COVID-19 were screened irrespective of symptoms. 21.7% were females and 1.4% had known CKD. 8 out of 61 (11.6%) had POC Cr > 150 umol/L attributed to AKI. COVID-19 associated AKI was associated with older age, higher respiratory rate, lower oxygen saturations and higher systolic blood pressure (5511 vs 3512 p <.001, 267 vs 212 p <.001, 88%7 vs 973 p <.001 and 14112 vs 12415 p 0.002 respectively). Conclusions: POC Cr technology detected AKI in one third of patients with high-risk clinical presentation and can be a valuable and possibly cost-effective tool to assist clinical decision making regarding early interventions and triage decisions in the ED and in the community setting. In patients diagnosed with COVID-19, AKI was present in 1 out of 10 of patients irrespective of symptoms and was associated with clinical observations indicating disease severity.

Patients and Methods This was a medical record review of all patients with a diagnosis code of long-COVID (DB948A) at all hospitals in the North Denmark Region from February 27, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Confirmed long-COVID was categorized as fulfillment of all three criteria: (1) a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on a respiratory sample or a positive serum antibody test, (2) symptoms suggestive of long-COVID with no other diagnosis considered more likely, and (3) symptom duration >6 weeks. Results A total of 306 patients were assigned a hospital diagnosis code for long-COVID corresponding to 1.4% of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals during the study period (n=21,727). Next, 40 patients were excluded due to incomplete diagnostic evaluation at time of record review leaving 266 patients for analysis. The patients had a median age of 51 years (interquartile range 43C60) and 175/266 (66%) were females. Long-COVID was confirmed in 249/266 yielding an overall PPV of 94% (95%CI: 90C96) and did not differ substantially according to most age groups, sex, previous hospitalization for COVID-19, or by using 12 weeks of symptom duration as cut-off. The PPV was low for children and adolescents (n=5), the very elderly (n=9), and those included by secondary long-COVID diagnoses (n=10).

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the patients were tested positive for the COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA extraction was performed from the same swab samples. Amplicon based libraries were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. Raw sequencing data were processed for variant calling and generating near-complete genome sequences. All three genomes were evaluated and compared with other worldwide isolates. RESULTS: The patients showed various clinics (an asymptomatic patient, patient with mild disease, and with severe pulmonary infiltration).

This report describes the development and optimization of a multiplexed immunobead assay for serological testing of common immunoglobulin isotypes (e.g., IgA, IgM, and IgG) associated with an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Assays were accomplished using a flow-based, multiplex fluorescent reader with dual-channel capability. Optimizations focused on analyte capture time, detection antibody concentration, and detection antibody incubation time. Analytical assay performance characteristics (e.g., assay range (including lower and upper limits of quantitation); and intra- and inter-assay precision) were established for either IgG/IgM or IgA/IgM serotype combination in tandem using the 'dual channel' mode. Analyte capture times of 30 min for IgG, 60 min for IgM, and 120 min for IgA were suitable for most applications, providing a balance of assay performance and throughput. Optimal detection antibody incubations at 4 g/mL for 30 min was observed and are recommended for general applications, given the overall excellent precision (percent coefficient of variance (%CV)  20%) and sensitivity values observed. The dynamic range for the IgG isotype spanned several orders of magnitude for each assay (Spike S1, Nucleocapsid, and Membrane glycoproteins), which supports robust titer evaluations at a 1:500 dilution factor for clinical applications. Finally, the optimized protocol was applied to monitoring Spike S1 seroconversion for subjects (n = 4) that completed a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine regimen.

The aim of this study is to explore the accuracy of transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography (TLUSG) in order to assess vocal fold movement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed blindly both TLUSG and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy(FFL) on 38 patients, from March to June 2020. Patients were divided into two groups:the former with normally mobile vocal folds and the latter with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. RESULTS: On FFL findings, 10/38 patients (26,31%) had unilateral vocal fold paralysis; on TLUSG results, 9/38 patients (23.68%) presented impaired vocal fold motion. In comparison to laryngoscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TLUSG for assessment of vocal fold mobility was 80%, 96.42%, 88.88%, 93.10% respectively. A significant association between the two techniques was found on the Chi-square test: X(2) = 19.7722 (p value <0.00001). Cohen's K value showed a substantial agreement: K = 0,79. CONCLUSION: Although TLUSG could undoubtedly not replace laringoscopy, it represents a noninvasive and useful diagnostic tool for otolaryngologists especially during covid-19 pandemic.Data collected about its high sensitivity and specificity suggest that TLUSG could be a reliable method to screen vocal fold paralysis without performing aerosol-generating procedures, thus providing clear visualization of laryngeal real-time movements, even in non-compliant or high-risk infection patients. Our results allow us to consider TLUSG as part of the preoperative assessment of vocal folds in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","output":"Transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography: A promising tool for otolaryngologists during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This article reviews current knowledge on the mechanisms affecting the fidelity of initiation codon selection, and discusses the effects of structural features in the 5-non-coding region on the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA molecules.","output":"Determinants of translational fidelity and efficiency in vertebrate mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the COVID-19 outbreak, teaching and learning have been forced to move fully to the Internet rather than the conventional offline medium.

Despite several antiviral drugs being commercially available, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecules efficacious against viral infections that act through different mechanisms of action. In this context, our attention is focused on novel compounds acting on nuclear receptors, whose activity could be beneficial in viral infections, including coronavirus, hepatitis C virus, and cytomegalovirus. ABSTRACT: The manipulation of host metabolisms by viral infections has been demonstrated by several studies, with a marked influence on the synthesis and utilization of glucose, nucleotides, fatty acids, and amino acids. The ability of virus to perturb the metabolic status of the infected organism is directly linked to the outcome of the viral infection. A great deal of research in recent years has been focusing on these metabolic aspects, pointing at modifications induced by virus, and suggesting novel strategies to counteract the perturbed host metabolism. In this review, our attention is turned on PPARs, nuclear receptors controlling multiple metabolic actions, and on the effects played by PPAR ligands during viral infections. The role of PPAR agonists and antagonists during SARS-CoV-2, HCV, and HCMV infections will be analyzed.","output":"PPAR Ligands Induce Antiviral Effects Targeting Perturbed Lipid Metabolism during SARS-CoV-2, HCV, and HCMV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 57-year-old man presented with a progressive flaccid symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy following a 1-week history of cough and malaise.

HIV\\\\1 envelope (Env) encodes epitopes for bnAbs of different specificities. Design of immunogens to induce bnAb precursors of different specificities and mature them into bnAb status is a goal for HIV\\\\1 vaccine development. We review vaccine strategies for bnAb lineages development and highlight the immunological barriers that these strategies must overcome to generate bnAbs. METHODS: We provide perspectives based on published research articles and reviews. DISCUSSION: The recent Antibody Mediated Protection (AMP) trial that tested the protective efficacy of one HIV\\\\1 Env bnAb specificity demonstrated that relatively high levels of long\\\\lasting serum titers of multiple specificities of bnAbs will be required for protection from HIV\\\\1 transmission. Current vaccine efforts for induction of bnAb lineages are focused on immunogens designed to expand na?ve HIV\\\\1 bnAb precursor B cells following the recent success of vaccine\\\\induction of bnAb precursor B cells in macaques and humans. BnAb precursor B cells serve as templates for priming\\\\immunogen design. However, design of boosting immunogens for bnAb maturation requires knowledge of the optimal immunogen design and immunological environment for bnAb B cell lineage affinity maturation. BnAb lineages acquire rare genetic changes as mutations during B cell maturation. Moreover, the immunological environment that supports bnAb development during HIV\\\\1 infection is perturbed with an altered B cell repertoire and dysfunctional immunoregulatory controls, suggesting that in normal settings, bnAb development will be disfavoured. Thus, strategies for vaccine induction of bnAbs must circumvent immunological barriers for bnAb development that normally constrain bnAb B cell affinity maturation. CONCLUSIONS: A fully protective HIV\\\\1 vaccine needs to induce durable high titers of bnAbs that can be generated by a sequential set of Env immunogens for expansion and maturation of bnAb B cell lineages in a permitted immunological environment. Moreover, multiple specificities of bnAbs will be required to be sufficiently broad to prevent the escape of HIV\\\\1 strains during transmission.","output":"Strategies for induction of HIV\\\\1 envelope\\\\reactive broadly neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mitogenome of the South American parthenogenetic lizard Loxopholis percarinatum Mller, 1923 (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae), a uni-bisexual species complex, was recovered for three individuals from Rio Negro region, Amazonas, Brazil.

This study aims to examine the current hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, post pandemic behavior intentions, and the relationship between behavior, psychosocial and contextual factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis, chi square and multiple logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26-22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32-2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23-2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21-2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15-2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05-2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic. In conclusion, the majority of respondents did increase their frequency of hand hygiene practices during COVID-19 pandemic. In line with previous studies in other pandemic contexts, sex, perceived susceptibility and effectiveness are important predictors of hand hygiene practices, which are similar to findings from previous studies in other pandemic contexts.

The early identification of high-risk drinkers followed by intervention is an effective way to reduce harm. We aim to assess the feasibility of integrating transient elastography (TE) into community alcohol services, and to determine its impact on modifying drinking behaviours. Method: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a community alcohol clinic in Nottingham, UK (April 2012 to March 2014). Patients (>18 years) with a primary alcohol problem were recruited. Those known to liver services or those known to have chronic liver disease were excluded. Significant liver fibrosis was defined by a liver stiffness of >8 kilopascal (kPa). Follow-up was for a minimum of six months. Data were descriptively analysed for significant differences between patients with a normal liver stiffness versus raised liver stiffness. Results: 156 patients were invited; n = 87 attended and n = 86 underwent successful TE. The majority were male (n = 53, 70.0%), and the mean age was 46.3 years (SD  9.8). Median liver stiffness was 6.9 kPa (range 3.1C75.0kPa). Clinically significant liver fibrosis was identified in n = 33 (38.4%), of which n = 6 were in the cirrhotic range (15 kPa). The baseline median self-reported alcohol intake for normal stiffness was 126 units per week (range 24C378) and in raised stiffness was 149.0 units per week (range 39.0C420.0); this difference was nonsignificant (p = 0.338). The median reduction in self-reported alcohol intake in the whole cohort was 65.0 units per week (range 27.0C88.0, p < 0.001); in the normal liver stiffness group it was 25.0 units per week (range 18.0C75.0, p = 0.154), and in the raised liver stiffness group it was 78.5 units per week (range 36.0C126.0, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The study demonstrated that transient elastography is a feasible tool to stratify clinically significant liver disease in community alcohol services.

ANIMALS: Three\\\\hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. METHODS: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. RESULTS: Enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P = .0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty\\\\seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D.

Our previous exposure studies revealed that traffic-generated emissions increase RAS signaling, further exacerbated by a high-fat diet. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to engine emissions increases systemic and local adipocyte RAS signaling, promoting the expression of factors involved in CVD and obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice (6C8 wk old) were fed either a high-fat (HF, n = 16) or low-fat (LF, n = 16) diet, beginning 30d prior to exposures, and then exposed via inhalation to either filtered air (FA, controls) or a mixture of diesel engine + gasoline engine vehicle emissions (MVE: 100 g PM/m(3)) via whole-body inhalation for 6 h/d, 7 d/wk, 30d. Endpoints were assessed via immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR. MVE-exposure promoted vascular adhesion factors (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) expression, monocyte/macrophage sequestration, and oxidative stress in the vasculature, associated with increased angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) expression. In the kidney, MVE-exposure promoted the expression of renin, AT1, and AT2 receptors. In adipose tissue, both HF-diet and MVE-exposure mediated increased epididymal fat pad weight and adipocyte hypertrophy, associated with increased angiotensinogen and AT1 receptor expression; however, these outcomes were further exacerbated in the MVE + HF group. MVE-exposure also induced inflammation, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and leptin, while reducing insulin receptor and glucose transporter, GLUT4, expression in adipose tissue.

In addition to its known effects on the cardiovascular system, hypercholesterolemia leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage in the bone marrow, which is a non-classical target organ of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we evaluate oxidative stress and assess the effect of genomic instability on cell cycle kinetics in atherosclerotic animals and determine if sildenafil reverses these detrimental effects in bone marrow cells. METHODS: Experiments were performed in male wild-type (WT) and apolipoprotein E knockout mice (apoE(?/?)) (9 weeks of age). apoE(?/?) mice were randomly distributed into the following 2 groups: sildenafil-treated (40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, n = 8) and vehicle-treated (n = 8), by oral gavage. After treatment, bone marrow cells were isolated to assess the production of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, determine cell cycle kinetics and evaluate the presence of micronucleated cells. RESULTS: Sildenafil treatment reduced the cytoplasmic levels of superoxide anion (~95 % decrease, p < 0.05) and decreased hydrogen peroxide (~30 % decrease, p < 0.05). Moreover, we observed protective effects on the DNA of bone marrow cells, including normal cell cycling, decreased DNA fragmentation and a diminished frequency of micronucleated cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that the excessive production of ROS in atherosclerotic mice overcome the DNA repair pathways in bone marrow cells.

Recently, in the search for more active compounds as potential pharmaceuticals, structural modification of the triterpene scaffold of HG at the C-3, C-12, C-13, C-23, and C-28 positions, has resulted in compounds that exhibited greater potency than HG itself. However, the low bioavailability and moderate hemolysis effect of HG may limit its clinical application. The cause of the observed toxic effects in some animals, including dogs, cats, cattle, goats, and horses also needs to be explained.

We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved F?rster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90C95% vs. 90C100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94C100%).

This study aimed to determine whether the Radiological Scale for Evaluating Hospital Admission (RSEHA) applied to chest X-rays of patients with COVID-19 when they present at the emergency department is related with the severity of COVID-19 in terms of the need for admission to the hospital, the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 292 patients with COVID-19 who presented at the emergency department between March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020. To standardize the radiologic patterns, we used the RSEHA, categorizing the radiologic pattern as mild, moderate, or severe. We analyzed the relationship between radiologic severity according to the RSEHA with the need for admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Hospital admission was necessary in 91.4% of the patients. The RSEHA was significantly associated with the need for hospital admission (p = 0.03) and with the need for ICU admission (p< 0.001). A total of 51 (17.5%) patients died; of these, 57% had the severe pattern on the RSEHA. When we analyzed mortality by grouping patients according to their results on the RSEHA and their age range, the percentage of patients who died increased after age 70 years in patients classified as moderate or severe on the RSEHA. CONCLUSIONS: Chest X-rays in patients with COVID-19 obtained in the emergency department are useful for determining the prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality; radiologic patterns categorized as severe on the RSEHA are associated with greater mortality and admission to the ICU.","output":"Utilidad de la radiografa de trax para evaluar el pronstico de pacientes con COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the world faces a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) challenge and infected cases are increasing exponentially.

In today's world, tourism has become a powerful industry, a huge complex in which the economic and social spheres are connected. The importance of tourism in international economic activity is constantly growing, and the market itself is acquiring new trends and features, affecting trade, transport and communications, agriculture and construction. The processes of globalization in the tourism market are characterized by changes in technology, modernization of transport infrastructure, internationalization of business activity and the creation of a regulatory mechanism. The potential of world tourist flows as factors of geopolitical influence is revealed, the structure of which reflects and influences the tendencies of international interaction. The main geopolitical factors influencing the dynamics and spatial organization of international tourist flows are structured. The world market of tourist services has a clear segmentation character. The main criteria for segmentation are motivational, age and regional ones. The general tendencies of development of the international tourism, a role and a place of Ukraine in the international tourist market are characterized. It is predicted that China will become the most popular tourist country in the near future. It is determined that due to the growth of intercontinental ties, which is based on the rapid development of vehicles and, above all, jet aircraft, as well as the desire of a significant number of people to visit the most remote and exotic corners of the Earth, tourism exchange between regions will develop more intensively than within regions. However, there is a growing tendency to increase the exchange of tourists between neighboring countries under conditions of normal relations between them and between countries with related languages. The main world events that have affected tourist flows in recent years are listed: Brexit, COVID-19, military actions in Eastern Ukraine and others. The analysis of international tourist flows in Ukraine was done, in particular their dynamics and spatial structure during 2010-2019 in the context of military-political aggression by Russia and the aggravation of Ukrainian-Russian interstate relations. It is established that the current dynamics of the international tourist flow in Ukraine is characterized by a sharp decrease in international visitors, slowing down the development of tourism and reformatting the spatial structure of the incoming and outgoing tourist flow. It is also noted that among the main factors hindering the development of the Ukrainian tourism industry are the unsatisfactory state of development of infrastructure and logistics of tourism, high prices, environmental and criminal risks, low innovation activity of tourism enterprises. It is concluded that international tourism is not only a passive participant in international relations, but also an active political actor who is able to act as a channel for establishing international trust and cooperation, a factor in maintaining political stability.","output":"Global Development of International Tourism and Impact on the Economy of Ukraine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The self-control model of depression suggests depressive symptoms to derive from distorted self-monitoring, dysfunctional self-evaluation and reduced self-reward as well as increased self-punishment. Building on this model a relationship between self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour, that is, harmful inactivity, and depression has been assumed. This association has been supported by a recent study in an inpatient sample. However, it remains unclear if patients with depressive disorders report more self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour than patients without depressive disorders and if self-directed passive aggression mediates the associations between distorted self-monitoring and dysfunctional self-evaluation with depressive symptoms. METHODS: Study 1 compared self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour levels between 220 psychotherapy outpatients with (n = 140; 67.9% female; M(age) = 40.0) and without (n = 80; 65.0% female; M(age) = 36.2) depressive disorders. Diagnoses were made based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Study 2 examined self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour as a mediator of the relationship between distorted self-monitoring and dysfunctional self-evaluation and self-reported depressive symptoms in 200 undergraduate Psychology students. RESULTS: Compared to outpatients without depressive disorders, outpatients with depressive disorder reported significantly more self-directed passive aggression (d = 0.51). Furthermore, Study 2 verified self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour as a partial mediator of the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes (ab(cs) = .22, 95%-CI: .14, .31), attributional style (ab(cs) = .20, 95%-CI: .13, .27), ruminative response style (ab(cs) = .15, 95%-CI: .09, .21) and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour partially mediates the association between distorted self-monitoring and dysfunctional self-evaluation with depressive symptoms. Future longitudinal studies need to examine a potential causal relationship that would form a base to include interventions targeting self-directed passive-aggressive behaviour in prevention and treatment of depression.

Given the high complexity involved, machine learning techniques are often considered to guide the tuning process and decompose the relations established between tuning variables. This paper presents a machine learning mechanism based on reinforcement learning that attaches to a hybrid replication middleware connected to a DBMS to dynamically live-tune the configuration of the middleware according to the workload being processed.

A total of 68 patients had reduced red blood cell (RBC) counts, 55 a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration (HBC) and 73 a decline in hematocrit (HCT). The false-negative rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in pharyngeal swab specimens was 18.7%. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), RBC, HBC and HCT levels in false-negative patients were significantly higher than those in patients who tested positive for viral nucleic acids. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that RBC [odds ratio (OR)=0.43, 95% CI: 0.18-0.99], HBC (OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and ALC (OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.20-0.91) were the factors influencing the negative testing results for viral nucleic acid.

Large hospitals in China have caused bed utilization rates to exceed 100% due to long-term extra beds.

We aim to generate an optimal admission plan of elective patients with the stochastic length of stay and different resource consumption. We assume that we can classify elective patients according to their registration information before admission. We formulated a general integer programming model considering heterogeneous patients and introducing patient priority constraints. The mathematical model is used to generate a scientific and reasonable admission planning, determining the best admission mix for multitype patients in a period. Compared with model II that does not consider priority constraints, model I proposed in this paper is better in terms of admissions and revenue. The proposed model I can adjust the priority parameters to meet the optimal output under different goals and scenarios.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and prospective survey study. SETTING: Intensive care units, large academic tertiary-care centre (USA). PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n=148) with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were eligible for inclusion. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Delirium was the primary outcome, assessed via validated chart review method. Secondary outcomes included measures related to delirium, such as delirium duration, antipsychotic use, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, inflammatory markers and final disposition. Neuroimaging data were also collected. Finally, a telephone survey was conducted between 1 and 2 months after discharge to determine neuropsychological function via the following tests: Family Confusion Assessment Method, Short Blessed Test, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognitive Abilities 4a and Patient-Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 108/148 (73%) patients, with median (IQR) duration lasting 10 (4C17) days. In the delirium cohort, 50% (54/108) of patients were African American and delirious patients were more likely to be female (76/108, 70%) (absolute standardised differences >0.30). Sedation regimens, inflammation, delirium prevention protocol deviations and hypoxic-ischaemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/108, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalisation, 4/17 (24%) later screened positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within 2 months after discharge.

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, a total of 1,027 MHD patients in 5 large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest. If patients developed symptoms after the initial screening was negative, repeat CT was performed. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with 2 consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody testing results for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, and laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined using t test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected with those infected and comparing those with infection detected using NAT with those with infection detected by positive serology test results. RESULTS: Among 1,027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among the 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT of the chest compared with 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure. LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSIONS: Half the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal CT of the chest and selective NAT. Serologic testing may help evaluate the overall prevalence and understand the diversity of clinical courses among patients receiving MHD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Serologic Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Hemodialysis Centers: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global financial market shocks have intensified due to the COVID-19 epidemic and other impacts, and the impacts of economic policy uncertainty on the financial system cannot be ignored.

Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools' affiliated clinical sites, physicians, patients, and the community. APPROACH: At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students' ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. OUTCOMES: Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. NEXT STEPS: The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS's daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","output":"Medical Student Mobilization During a Crisis: Lessons From a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and pandemic disease with a variable mode of action. Patients with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases are more prone to infection. An understanding of the different comorbidities that place patients at the highest risk of COVID-19 pneumonia and other fatal complications associated with COVID-19 is necessary for healthcare professionals. This study aimed to determine the frequency of different comorbid illnesses among COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who required admission for the care of their symptoms were included in this observational, cross-sectional study conducted from May 1 to July 30, 2020. The patients were treated at a specialized COVID-19 isolation ward built at the Dow University of Health Sciences at the Ojha campus. The patients were referred from the emergency department, medical and allied wards, and COVID-19 screening units. A detailed history and clinical examination were performed, and comorbidities were evaluated. Results A total of 212 patients were admitted during the study with a mean age of 52  16 years. The study population consisted of 120 (56.6%) males and 92 (43.39%) females, and the most common comorbidities were uncontrolled diabetes with hypertension (n = 56; 26.4%), controlled diabetes (n = 22; 10.37%), obstructive airway disease (n = 16; 7.5%), and interstitial lung disease (n = 14; 6.6%). A total of 48 (22.64%) patients had no comorbidities. Conclusions Most COVID-19-positive patients with pneumonia were male, and common comorbidities included uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive and restrictive lung disease.

The relationship between the infection rate, growth rate, and doubling time for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and atmospheric variables are also investigated in this study. Daily data describing the number of COVID\\\\19 cases and atmospheric variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, and solar radiation, were collected for the period February 24 to May 30, 2020. Stochastic models were employed to analyze how atmospheric variables can affect the transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. The normal and lognormal probability and cumulative density functions (PDF and CDF) were applied to analyze the relationship between atmospheric variables and COVID\\\\19 cases. The Spearman's rank correlation test and multiple regression model were used to investigate the correlation of the studied variables with the transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and to confirm the findings obtained from the stochastic models.

Analysis of the model dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the expected or averaged output from the agent-based model. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex agent-based models may be infeasible, and coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to accurately describe model dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning field provide a promising, novel and unifying approach for agent-based model analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer differential equation models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from equation learning can be used to learn differential equation models from agent-based model simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few model simulations, and accurately predicts model dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two agent-based models that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread.","output":"Learning differential equation models from stochastic agent-based model simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical to reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2.

Such affected elderly would need long-term care due to the various health problems caused by the disaster. A Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system provides care services in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the 2018 Japan Floods on LTCI costs and service utilization. METHODS: The participants of this retrospective cohort study were all verified persons utilizing LTCI services in Hiroshima, Okayama and Ehime prefectures. The observation period was from 2 months before to 6 months after the disaster. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to examine the association between disaster status (victims or non-victims) and the monthly total costs of LTCI service (with gamma-distribution/log-link) by residential environment (home or facility). Among home residents, we also examined each service utilization (home-based service, short-stay service and facility service), using the GEEs. After the GEEs, we estimated Average Marginal Effects (AME) over all observation periods by months as the attributable disaster effect. RESULTS: The total number of participants was 279,578. There were 3024 flood victims. The disaster was associated with significantly higher total costs. The AME for home residents at 2 months after was $214 (Standard Error (SE): 12, p < 0.001), which was the highest through the observation period. Among facility residents, the AME immediately after the disaster increased by up to $850 (SE: 29, p < 0.001). The service utilization among home residents showed a different trend for each service.

Antiviral therapy is the most important treatment for COVID-19. Among the drugs under investigation, anti-malarials, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are being repurposed as treatment for COVID-19. CQ/HCQ were shown to prevent receptor recognition by coronaviruses, inhibit endosome acidification, which interferes with membrane fusion, and exhibit immunomodulatory activity. These multiple mechanisms may work together to exert a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. A number of in vitro studies revealed inhibitory effects of CQ/HCQ on various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 although conflicting results exist. Several clinical studies showed that CQ/HCQ alone or in combination with a macrolide may alleviate the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, promote viral conversion, and delay disease progression, with less serious adverse effects. However, recent studies indicated that the use of CQ/HCQ, alone or in combination with a macrolide, did not show any favorable effect on patients with COVID-19. Adverse effects, including prolonged QT interval after taking CQ/HCQ, may develop in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, current data are not sufficient enough to support the use of CQ/HCQ as therapies for COVID-19 and increasing caution should be taken about the application of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 before conclusive findings are obtained by well-designed, multi-center, randomized, controlled studies.","output":"Advances in the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface water improvements associated with the COVID-19 economic slowdown illustrate environmental resiliency and societal control over urban water quality.","output":"Pandemic spotlight on urban water quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare but deadly new disease in children that rapidly progresses to hyperinflammation, shock, and can lead to multiple organ failure if unrecognized.

In past years, deep learning has been increasingly applied to the analysis of text from social networks. However, most of the developed approaches can only capture topics or sentiments alone but not both together. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to develop a new approach, based on deep neural networks, for simultaneously capturing public topics and sentiments and applied it to tweets sent just after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: A total of 1,386,496 tweets were collected, preprocessed, and split with a ratio of 80:20 into training and validation sets, respectively. We combined lexicons and convolutional neural networks to improve sentiment prediction. The trained model achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and a precision of 82% and was able to capture simultaneously the weighted words associated with a predicted sentiment intensity score. These outputs were then visualized via an interactive and customizable web interface based on a word cloud representation. Using word cloud analysis, we captured the main topics for extreme positive and negative sentiment intensity scores. RESULTS: In reaction to the announcement of the pandemic by the WHO, 6 negative and 5 positive topics were discussed on Twitter. Twitter users seemed to be worried about the international situation, economic consequences, and medical situation. Conversely, they seemed to be satisfied with the commitment of medical and social workers and with the collaboration between people. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new method based on deep neural networks for simultaneously extracting public topics and sentiments from tweets.

In the past few decades, labor costs, concerns regarding chemical waste, and more stringent regulations in developed countries have shifted the production of APIs to emerging economies, notably India and China. Nowadays, Europe and North America rely on imports for the majority of pharmaceuticals. The recent COVID pandemic as well as logistical challenges have called this model into question and have raised the interest in rebalancing distributed global API supply chains and possibly reshoring some API production to Europe and North America. API production often suffers from unfavorable Green Chemistry metrics, owing to complex routes, outdated chemistry for established entities, or lack of maturity of routes for newer entities. The environmental footprint of API synthesis routes benefits from renewables as starting materials. One such abundant renewable material is lignin, which can be converted to phenol and catechol. In addition, waste could be reduced by co-producing APIs in an integrated plant and the use of advanced catalysts. This Perspective demonstrates green production routes from phenol or catechol in four large scale examples: paracetamol (Tylenol (R)), acetyl salicylic acid (Aspirin (R)), amoxicillin (as sole API or as combination with potassium clavulanate (Augmentin (R)), and epinephrine (adrenaline, also as trademark Adrenaline (R)).

Despite differences in different healthcare settings and the significance of a person-centered approach, little research has investigated facilitators of community-based end-of-life care from the perspective of service recipients. In particular, there has been limited exploration of strategies to ensure positive outcomes at an operational level. AIM To explore factors facilitating positive end-of-life care provision in community-based settings and how these are achieved in practice, from the perspectives of patients and family caregivers. DESIGN A qualitative cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken through semi-structured interviews with patients and family caregivers subjected to thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Ten patients and 16 family caregivers were recruited from an end-of-life community care program provided by four non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong. RESULTS Seven core themes were identified: positive emotions about the relationship, positive appraisals of the relationship, care through inquiring about recipients' circumstances, instrumentality of care (i.e. information, coaching on care, practical help, psychological support, multiple activities), comprehensiveness of care (i.e. diversity, post-death care, family-level wellbeing), structure of care (i.e. timely follow-up, well-developed system), and qualities of workers. CONCLUSIONS Improvement in service quality might be achieved through alternating the perceptions or emotional reactions of care recipients toward care providers and increased use of sensitive inquiry.

We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well. MethodsWe used meteorological, pollen/hay fever and mobility data from the Netherlands with its 17.4 million inhabitants. For the reproduction number of COVID-19 (Rt), we used data from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health. This Rt metric is a daily estimate that is based on positive COVID-19 tests in the Netherlands in hospitals and municipalities. For all datasets we selected the overlapping period of COVID-19 and the first allergy season: from February 17, 2020 till September 21, 2020 (total number of measurements: n = 218), the end of pollen season. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop an environmental prediction model of the Rt of COVID-19. Next, we studied whether adding mobility trends to an environmental model improved the predictive power. ResultsBy means of stepwise backward multiple linear regression four highly significant (p value < 0.01) predictive factors are selected in our combined model: temperature, solar radiation, hay fever incidence, and mobility to indoor recreation locations. Our combined model explains 87.5% of the variance of Rt of COVID-19 and has a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 374.2, p-value < 0.00001. The combined model had a better overall predictive performance compared to a solely environmental model, which still explains 77.3% of the variance of Rt, and a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 181.3, p < 0.00001. ConclusionsWe conclude that the combined mobility and environmental model can adequately predict the seasonality of COVID-19 in a country with a temperate climate like the Netherlands. In this model higher solar radiation, higher temperature and hay fever are related to lower COVID-19 reproduction, and mobility to indoor recreation locations with increased COVID-19 spread.

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in childhood and adolescence. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety levels among the mothers of children under follow-up for epilepsy in our clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study group consisted of the mothers of epilepsy patients who were under follow-up in the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic of the tertiary care center and were scheduled for a routine examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mothers' anxiety levels according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory and their opinions about COVID-19 in relation to their child were assessed and compared based on whether the mother/patient attended their appointments in person and whether the child had frequent or infrequent seizures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety level between the mothers of 64 children with epilepsy who attended their appointment during the pandemic and those of the mothers of 52 who did not attend their appointment. However, the mothers of children with frequent seizures had significantly higher anxiety levels.

We and others have previously demonstrated regenerative functions of human platelet lysate (HPL) as an alternative platelet-derived product. Here we separated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from soluble factors of HPL to understand the mode of action during skin-organoid formation and immune modulation as model systems for tissue regeneration. HPL-EVs were isolated by tangential-flow filtration (TFF) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) separating EVs from (lipo)protein-enriched soluble fractions. We characterized samples by tunable resistive pulse sensing, western blot, tandem mass-tag proteomics and super-resolution microscopy. We evaluated EV function during angiogenesis, wound healing, organoid formation and immune modulation. We characterized EV enrichment by TFF and SEC according to MISEV2018 guidelines. Proteomics showed three major clusters of protein composition separating TSEC-EVs from HPL clustering with TFF soluble fractions and TFF-EVs clustering with TSEC soluble fractions, respectively. HPL-derived TFF-EVs promoted skin-organoid formation and inhibited T-cell proliferation more efficiently than TSEC-EVs or TSEC-soluble fractions. Recombining TSEC-EVs with TSEC soluble fractions re-capitulated TFF-EV effects. Zeta potential and super-resolution imaging further evidenced protein corona formation on TFF-EVs. Corona depletion on SEC-EVs could be artificially reconstituted by TSEC late fraction add-back. In contrast to synthetic nanoparticles, which commonly experience reduced function after corona formation, the corona-bearing EVs displayed improved functionality. We conclude that permissive isolation technology, such as TFF, and better understanding of the mechanism of EV corona function are required to realize the complete potential of platelet-based regenerative therapies.","output":"Synergy of Human Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles with Secretome Proteins Promotes Regenerative Functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social distancing measures implemented to contain the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide have created a series of emotional and economic challenges.

Methods: SARS-CoV-2 gene cloning, purification of S2 and N recombinant proteins, viral RNA isolation from patients blood samples, reverse transcription with quantitative real-time PCR ((RT)(2)-PCR), ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescent analysis with magnetic beads (xMAP) for detection of 17 inflammation markers. Results: Fluorescent Ag nanoclusters (NCs) less than 2 nm with a few recovered silver atoms, citrate coated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 20C120 nm, and nanoconjugates of 50C150 nm consisting of Ag NPs with different protein envelopes were constructed from AgNO(3) and analyzed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible light absorption, and fluorescent spectroscopy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from COVID-19 patients blood samples was completely cleaved with the artificial RNase complex compound Li(+)[Ag(+)(2)Cys(2)(?)(OH(?))(2)(NH(3))(2)] (Ag-2S), whereas other Ag-containing materials provided partial RNA degradation only. Treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 and N recombinant antigens with AgNO(3) and Ag NPs inhibited their binding with specific polyclonal antibodies, as shown by ELISA. Fluorescent Ag NCs with albumin or immunoglobulins, Ag-2S complex, and nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with protein shells had no effect on the interaction between coronavirus recombinant antigens and antibodies. Reduced production of a majority of the 17 inflammation biomarkers after treatment of three human cell lines with nanosilver was demonstrated by xMAP. Conclusion: The antiviral properties of the silver nanomaterials against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus differed. The small-molecular-weight artificial RNase Ag-2S provided exhaustive RNA destruction but could not bind with the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens. On the contrary, Ag(+) ions and Ag NPs interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens N and S but were less efficient at performing viral RNA cleavage. One should note that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more stable than MS2 phage RNA. The isolated RNA of both the MS2 phage and SARS-CoV-2 were more degradable than the MS2 phage and coronavirus particles in patients blood, due to the protection with structural proteins. To reduce the risk of the virus resistance, a combined treatment with Ag-2S and Ag NPs could be used. To prevent cytokine storm during the early stages of respiratory infections with RNA-containing viruses, nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with surface proteins could be recommended.","output":"Targeting of Silver Cations, Silver-Cystine Complexes, Ag Nanoclusters, and Nanoparticles towards SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Recombinant Virion Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to clarify the frequency of missed mandibular fractures and to identify possible predictive factors for missed diagnosis. This was a retrospective study that included patients <20 years of age with a recent mandibular fracture. The outcome variable was missed mandibular fracture, which was determined when a fracture was not suspected or diagnosed during the patient's first assessment in primary healthcare. The primary predictor variable was age group (i.e. children <13 years or teenagers/adolescents aged 13-19 years). The explanatory variables were sex, mechanism of injury, and type of facial facture. Other variables were clinical symptoms and findings. Mandibular fracture was missed at first contact in 27 of 182 patients (14.8%). Fracture was missed significantly more often in patients <13 years than in older patients (33.3% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001). The only significant symptom or clinical finding that was associated with missed fractures was skin wound of the jaw (P=0.009). There was no association between missed fracture and sex or mechanism of injury. Mandibular fractures in children are often missed at the first healthcare contact.

We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2C12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised.

These symptoms have mainly been assessed in single-task setting, which might not represent activities of daily living accurately. Therefore, a dual-task protocol, consisting of the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks, was developed. This protocol assesses cognitive and motor performance in general, as well as cognitive-motor interference in specific. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The motor component of the 2BALANCE protocol consists of a static and dynamic postural task. These motor tasks are combined with different cognitive tasks assessing visuospatial cognition, processing speed, working memory and response inhibition. First, testCretest reliability will be assessed with an interval of 2 weeks in a group of young adults. Second, the 2BALANCE protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy. Finally, the protocol will be implemented in persons with unilateral vestibular loss. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2BALANCE project aims to elucidate the impact of vestibular dysfunction on cognitive and motor performance in dual-task setting. This protocol represents everyday situations better than single-task protocols, as dual-tasks such as reading street signs while walking are often encountered during daily activities. Ultimately, this project could enable individualised and holistic clinical care in these patients, taking into account single as well as dual-task performance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University Hospital on 5 July 2019 with registration number B670201940465. All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

To evaluate their abundance and genetic diversity in adult patients, RV RNA in respiratory samples was assessed using real-time RT-PCR and the partial nucleic acid sequencing of viral genomes. Additionally, clinical data were retrieved from patient charts to determine the clinical significance of adult RV infections. In total, the respiratory specimens of 284 adult patients (18C90 years), collected from 2013 to 2017, were analyzed. Infections occurred throughout the entire year, with peaks occurring in fall and winter, and showed a remarkably high intra- and interseasonal diversity of RV genotypes. RV species were detected in the following ratios: 60.9% RV-A 173, 12.7% RV-B, and 26.4% RV-C. No correlations between RV species and underlying comorbidities such as asthma (p = 0.167), COPD (p = 0.312) or immunosuppression (p = 0.824) were found. However, 21.1% of the patients had co-infections with other pathogens, which were associated with a longer hospital stay (p = 0.024), LRTI (p < 0.001), and pneumonia (p = 0.01).

In this article we describe our experience at Richmond University Medical Center with Chembio serological IgM, IgG testing. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of patients and hospital employees, we utilized Chembio COVID-19 IgM/IgG serological testing in addition to Cepheid RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of Chembio serological test for IgM and IgG as an employee screening tool in a community hospital setting. The total number of currently asymptomatic employees screened was 1,866 from the Richmond University Medical Center. The non-exposed group included 1,253 (67.1%) employees with no significant clinical history and non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies. The convalescent group included 255 (13.7%) of the employees with elevation of IgG only, 18 (1%) employees with past history of positive PCR and COVID-19 who currently have non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies or demonstrate elevated IgG only, followed by 3 employees (< 1%) with no past clinical history who demonstrated reactive IgM and IgG antibodies and negative follow up by PCR. The reported 14.9% exposure/convalescent rate is lower than the reported 20% by the Department of Health and Governor Andrew Cuomo and may represent a better utilization of personal protective equipment, better hand washing techniques, and better disinfection procedures combined with strict social distancing.

While open partial nephrectomy remains the reference standard of the management of renal masses, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) continues to evolve. Conventional techniques include clamping the renal vessels risking ischaemic damage of the clamped organ. Thus, new techniques are needed that combine a sufficient tissue incision for exstirpation of the tumor with an efficient coagulation to assure haemostasis and abandon renal vessel clamping in LPN. Laser-excision of renal tumors during laparoscopic surgery seems to be a logical solution. METHODS We performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 11 patients with a renal tumor in exophytic position (mean size 32 mm, ranging 8-45 mm) by laser-supported LPN. RESULTS Regular ultrasound monitoring and insertion of a temporary drainage showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. All tumors were removed with a histopathologically confirmed surrounding margin of normal renal tissue (R0 resection). Serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery.

RESULTS: We identified 120 patients [median age: 7 years (interquartile range (IQR): 4C10)] with male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Overall, 73 out of 120 children (60.8%) presented with shock, 63 (52.5%) required inopressor support, and 51 (43%) required respiratory support. We categorized the cohort into three observed clinical phenotypes: MIS-C with shock (n = 63), MIS-C with Kawasaki disease (KD) (n = 23), and MIS-C without shock and KD (n = 34). Atypical presentations were hypothermia, orchitis, meningoencephalitis, demyelination, polyneuropathy, pancreatitis, and appendicitis. Ninety-four percent had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 (78.3%, seropositive and 15.8%, RT-PCR positive).

This paper investigates the relationship between the housing morphology and the air quality in three housing estates in Shenzhen.

A correlation study between the configuration variables of the urban form and the CFD air flow pattern helps to identify the key variables influencing the air quality. This study concludes that in housing estates with good air quality of surroundings, the building density has no remarkable effect. However, the footprint of buildings, the layout of podiums, the roughness length of the building, the distance between buildings, the open space aspect ratio and the mean building height may have a remarkable impact on the air flow and quality.

Since then, platelet transfusions have undergone numerous modifications from whole blood-derived platelet-rich plasma to apheresis-derived platelet concentrates. Similarly, the storage time and temperature have changed. The mandate to store platelets for a maximum of 5-7 days at room temperature has been challenged by recent clinical trial data, ongoing difficulties with transfusion-transmitted infections, and recurring periods of shortages, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternative platelet storage approaches are as old as the first platelet transfusions. Cold-stored platelets may offer increased storage times (days) and improved hemostatic potential at the expense of reduced circulation time. Frozen (cryopreserved) platelets extend the storage time to years but require storage at -80 C and thawing before transfusion. Lyophilized platelets can be powder-stored for years at room temperature and reconstituted within minutes in sterile water but are probably the least explored alternative platelet product to date.

Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome. Success has been achieved with the use of medications in studies of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the rapid detection of complications caused by the virus. Further studies in SARS-CoV-2 patients with chronic liver disease are needed.","output":"COVID-19 in a Patient with Liver Cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The analgesic effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) combined with physical therapy remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To systematically review available evidence comparing tDCS with any physical therapy modality (PTM) to PTM alone or PTM with sham tDCS on pain relief on common musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, namely knee osteoarthritis (KOA), chronic low back pain (CLBP), myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) and fibromyalgia. METHODS EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from inception to April 2019 for randomized controlled trials. Reviewers independently assessed the studies quality and extracted data according to the PRISMA protocol. The GRADE approach was used to asses quality of evidence and a \\"Summary of Findings\\" table was created. The analyses used random-effects model. The primary outcome was pain reduction after treatment. RESULTS Eight articles were included. Only one study had low risk of bias. Quality of evidence was considered low or very low. Significant reduction in pain scores were found for fibromyalgia and KOA (Standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.94 [95% CI: -3.37 to -0.49; I 2=76.4%] and SMD = -2.35 [95% CI: -3.63 to -1.06; I 2=69.7%] respectively). Subgroup analysis considering the type of PTM despite MSK condition revealed significant reduction in pain scores for exercise, SMD = -1.20 [95% CI: -1.683 to -0.717; I 2=10.8%]. CONCLUSIONS Large heterogeneity and low quality of evidence and limited number of studies were found. Results suggest a potential analgesic effect of tDCS in combination with a PTM for fibromyalgia and KOA. Subgroup analysis suggests a stronger effect of tDCS when combined with an exercise based PTM.","output":"The Analgesic Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) combined with Physical Therapy on Common Musculoskeletal Conditions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Root phenotypes play profoundly important roles supporting plant growth and their adaptive responses to myriad environmental stresses. For example, architecture-scale traits such as root angle can have a major impact on foraging efficiency for immobile and mobile soil nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate, respectively (Schneider et al., 2022). Increasing evidence supports the importance of anatomical-scale traits, such as root hair length and xylem size, conferring abiotic stress tolerance in crops (Cai et al., 2022; Kohli et al., 2022; Cornelis & Ora, 2022), whilst major steps are being made to dissect molecular-scale adaptive mechanisms, such as ways roots detoxify metals and metalloids (Kirk et al., 2022; Podar & Maathuis, 2022).

With over two-year since the pandemic originated from Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 6 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of mutant strains and COVID-19 surge waves, it becomes critically important to conduct epidemiological studies that allow us to understand the role of various environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our earlier study reported a strong negative correlation of temperature and COVID-19 incidence. This study is basically an extension to our previous study with global analysis of COVID-19 in northern hemisphere countries. This study aimed to see the correlation of temperature, sunlight and humidity with new cases of COVID-19 in northern hemisphere countries from March 2020 to February 2022. Month-wise univariate analysis indicated a strong negative correlation of temperature and sunlight with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity while inconsistencies were observed in correlation analysis in the case of humidity in winter months. Moreover, strong negative correlation between average temperature of winter months and COVID-19 cases exists as evidenced by Pearson, Spearman and Kendall analysis. In addition, correlation pattern between monthly temperature and COVID-19 cases of a country mimics to that of sunlight of a country. This pilot study proposes that low temperatures and low sunlight might be additional risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity mostly in northern hemisphere countries.","output":"Effect of environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in northern hemisphere countries: A Two-Year Data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract/Summary SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell's machinery.

We predict the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and sgRNAs to be enriched towards the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus, and that the 5 and 3 viral untranslated regions contain the strongest, most distinct localization signals. We interpret the mitochondrial residency signal as an indicator of intracellular RNA trafficking with respect to double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle.

In recent decades, the rapid development of molecular tools, especially the wide application of next generation sequencing technologies, helps to unravel the community composition, structure, and dynamic variation in wastewater. Overall, this chapter mainly focuses on biological HRPs, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater. The characteristics, classification, fates, functions, and health implications of these HRPs are introduced in detail. Moreover, the biogeography of HRPs is a research hotspot in recent years, and available information is also summarized in this chapter.

METHODS We enrolled three groups of children: one with Crohn's disease (CD), one with Ulcerative colitis (UC), and a control group of healthy subjects. For all the partecipants the potential thromboembolic risk was evaluated clinically and with laboratory tests. RESULTS We studied: 30 children (25.6%) with CD, 28 (23.9%) with UC, and 59 (50.4%) healthy control subjects. Regarding PCDAI, no significant differences between thromboembolic risk factors and disease activity were detected. Instead, in the patients with UC, stratified with the PUCAI, there was a statistically significant difference in serum fibrinogen levels between patients with mild and moderate/severe disease [3.8 (3.2-4.5) g/L vs 5.7 (4.8-6.2) g/L, p < 0.0032].Serum homocysteine levels were lower in healthy controls than in CD (p = 0.176) and UC (p = 0.026).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 8 patients with post-intensive care tracheal stenosis and previous COVID-19 pneumonia aged 34-61 years between January 2021 and April 2021. Lung damage CT-3 was observed in 2 (25%) patients, CT-4 - in 5 (62.5%) patients. In one case, COVID-19 pneumonia with lung damage CT-2 joined to acute cerebrovascular accident. Post-tracheostomy stenosis was detected in 7 (87.5%) cases, post-intubation stenosis - in 1 patient. Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation ranged from 5 to 130 days. In 75% of cases, tracheal stenosis was localized in the larynx and cervical trachea. Two patients admitted with tracheostomy. In one case, an extended tracheal stenosis was combined with atresia of infraglottic part of the larynx. One patient had tracheal stenosis combined with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Length of tracheal stenosis was 15-45 mm. Tracheomalacia was observed in 4 (50%) patients. All patients had severe concomitant diseases. RESULTS: To restore airway patency, we used circular tracheal resection with anastomosis, laryngotracheoplasty and endoscopic methods. Tracheal resection combined with TEF required circular tracheal resection with disconnection of fistula. Adequate breathing through the natural airways was restored in all patients. There was no postoperative mortality. Three patients with baseline tracheal stenosis had favorable postoperative outcomes after circular tracheal resection. Four patients are at the final stage of treatment after laryngotracheoplasty and tracheal stenting. CONCLUSION: Patients after invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia are at high risk of cicatricial tracheal stenosis and require follow-up. Circular tracheal resection ensures early rehabilitation and favorable functional results. Laryngotracheoplasty is preferred if circular tracheal resection is impossible. This procedure ensures adequate debridement of tracheobronchial tree and respiratory support. Endoscopic measures are an alternative for open surgery, especially for intrathoracic tracheal stenosis and intractable tracheobronchitis.","output":"[Treatment of post-intensive care tracheal stenosis after previous covid-19 pneumonia]./ Lechenie postreanimatsionnykh rubtsovykh stenozov trakhei posle perenesennoi koronavirusnoi pnevmonii Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world was severely affected by the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Accordingly, this cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the echocardiography indices which are indicators of the cardiac alterations of the children with COVID19 infection. Methods: This study was performed as a cross-sectional study evaluating echocardiography indices in children infected with COVID19. Fifteen children, known cases of the COVID19, and 14 healthy children were enrolled. Evaluated parameters include left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVED), mitral valve Sa (MV Sa), Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and laboratory parameters. Results: The participants' mean age and weight were 62.8 (48.0) months and 19.95 (15.67) kg, respectively. None of the laboratory and echocardiography parameters differed between males and females, between patients with and without positive past medical history, between the patients with and without respiratory tract symptoms, and between patients with and without GI tract symptoms (P.0.05). Patients had significantly higher TAPSE (p = 0.027), although MV Sa (p = 0.01) was significantly higher among healthy children. LV EF (p = 0.425) and LVED diameter (p = 0.603) were not different significantly. None of the patients had pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Conclusion: The heart can be involved during the disease course in children, even at the level of echocardiography indices.

To explore these putative roles, we evaluated the independent and joint associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with pneumonia risk in a prospective cohort study of 2275 men aged 42-61 years at recruitment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Objectively measured CRF and self-reported sauna bathing habits were assessed at baseline. CRF was categorized as low and high (median cut-offs) and FSB as low and high (defined as &#8804;1 and 2-7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 26.6 years, 529 cases of pneumonia occurred. Comparing high vs low CRF, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CIs) for pneumonia was 0.75 (0.61-0.91). Comparing high vs low FSB, the corresponding HR was 0.81 (0.68-0.97). Compared to men with low CRF & low FSB, the multivariable-adjusted HRs of pneumonia for the following groups: high CRF & low FSB; low CRF & high FSB; and high CRF & high FSB were 0.88 (0.65-1.20), 0.89 (0.71-1.13), and 0.62 (0.48-0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a general male Caucasian population, a combination of high fitness levels and frequent sauna baths is associated with a substantially lowered future pneumonia risk compared with each modality alone.

MKRN3 was thereby suggested to serve as a 'brake' of mammalian puberty onset, but the underlying mechanisms remain as yet unknown. Here, we report that genetic ablation of Mkrn3 did accelerate mouse puberty onset with increased production of hypothalamic GnRH1. MKRN3 interacts with and ubiquitinates MBD3, which epigenetically silences GNRH1 through disrupting the MBD3 binding to the GNRH1 promoter and recruitment of DNA demethylase TET2.

Growth of ETV in cell culture allowed for the characterization of the virus, in terms of its morphology, morphogenesis, protein and nucleic acid composition, and facilitated investigations into its replication strategy. The successful propagation of ETV in cell cultures facilitated the development of a virus-neutralization assay that made it possible to gain an insight into the sero-epidemiology of this virus in various animal populations. Although ETV has been isolated, only once from a horse, there is evidence that antigenically related viruses are widespread in the equine population.

A balanced immune response is essential to mounting anti-viral defences, and biomarkers such as the white blood cell (WBC) count, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive-protein (LCR) ratio have been reported as potential predictors of immune status. The beneficial immunomodulation effects of a biological response modifier glucan (BRMG) produced by two strains of Aureobasidium pullulans , AFO-202 and N-163, were reported in earlier in vitro studies. In this study, we compared their efficacy on immune-inflammatory parameters in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Methods: : This study was performed on four groups of healthy SD rats, with six subjects in each group: Group 1, which was euthanised on Day 0 to obtain baseline values;Group 2, which served as the control (drinking water);Group 3, which received AFO-202 beta glucan at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day;and Group 4, which received N-163 beta glucan at a dose of 300 mg/kg/day. Test solutions were administered to the animals in Groups 2C4 by gavage once daily for 28 consecutive days. Biochemical analyses were conducted on haematological, immunological and inflammatory biomarkers on Days 15 and 29. Results: : The NLR decreased, whereas the LCR and leukocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR) increased in Group 3 (AFO-202) at 15 days, but the values were within the normal physiological range only. At 29 days, this difference among the groups was not observed. There were no significant differences between the groups in the other parameters, such as red blood cell (RBC) count, WBC count, CRP, IgA, IL-6, IFN- and sFAS. Conclusion: AFO-202 beta glucan helps marginally decrease NLR and increase LCR and LeCR in healthy SD rats within 15 days.

As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile apps could be used to support young adults to develop low-risk drinking habits and improve their general health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence. Baseline (T0), 6-week postbaseline (T1), and 3-month postbaseline (T2) assessments will be conducted and analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modeling analyses. RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2020. We received 933 registrations via our study information website; 506 participants have completed the T0 assessment, 336 participants have completed the T1 assessment, and 308 participants have completed the T2 assessment as of May 2021. The study is still in progress, and results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. Such interventions are yet understudied, and it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile app will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to an alcohol educational website (control condition). If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

We showed that Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam reduced the viral infection ratio to a greater extent than TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam. Our findings suggest that the infection risk by polluted air could be decreased using Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam in air cleaners.","output":"Photocatalytic activity of Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam inactivates bacteriophages and Legionella pneumophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tackling inequalities is essential for justice, security, and preparedness","output":"Preparing democracies for pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Examine the rates and factors associated with under- and overreporting of subjective changes in smell or taste as compared with objective measures. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2014). METHODS We examined participants 40 years old who completed subjective questionnaires (smell, n = 3510; taste, n = 3089), validated objective 8-odor pocket smell tests, and NaCl/quinine taste tests. Over- and underreporting was determined by the difference in subjective and objective results. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses incorporated sampling weights. RESULTS A majority of participants correctly classified impairment: smell (73.7%; 95% CI, 71.2%-76.1%) and taste (78.3%; 95% CI, 75.6%-80.7%). Age 65 years (odds ratio, 2.23; P = .001) was associated with underreporting impairment, and persistent cold symptoms (odds ratio, 2.15; P = .001) were associated with overreporting smell impairment. Smoke, onion, and natural gas scents were incorrectly identified more frequently by individuals aged 65 years after Bonferroni correction. No factors were associated with under- and overreporting taste impairment. CONCLUSION Although the concordance rate between subjective and objective assessment of smell and taste impairment remains high, we found that older age was associated with incorrect report of impairment. This suggests that the subjective perception of smell varies across demographical and clinical factors, and it is important to not overlook such factors in clinical practice. Potentially using a simplified odor assessment regularly in the clinical setting may aid in early detection and intervention.","output":"Discordance Between Subjective and Objective Measures of Smell and Taste in US Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduced colonoscopy capacity in the UK resulting in increased waiting times for investigation. To increase diagnostic capacity and reduce the risk of diagnostic delay, CT colonography (CTC) and colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) are increasingly being relied upon. Endoscopic assessment and treatment will be required for those patients with large colonic polyps or malignant tumours detected by CTC or CCE, provided they are fit enough to undergo further investigation. The management of patients with intermediate (6-9mm) and diminutive (<6mm) colonic polyps, reported by CTC and CCE, will increasingly be decided by clinicians. Published literature suggests the risk of progression to malignancy of intermediate or diminutive polyps over 3 years is low. Furthermore, the risk of intermediate or diminutive polyps harbouring malignancy is extremely low. The benefits, and timeline, for the removal of these polyps must be carefully considered for patients. We present a pragmatic approach to managing intermediate and diminutive polyps. We suggest delayed polypectomy (up to one year) for patients with intermediate polyps who are likely to benefit. For those patients with diminutive polyps, we advocate further surveillance only for younger patients where clinical concern exists. This meets the aspirations of Realistic Medicine, providing a risk-based approach for patients, while appropriately prioritising resources.","output":"Follow\\\\up of small and diminutive colonic polypsHow to balance the risks in the COVID\\\\19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La presente conversacin nos invita a pensar el carcter fundamental del gnero en la estructuracin de las relaciones entre naturaleza y poder, la articulacin de distintas violencias que sostienen el extractivismo agrario, y la proliferacin de lenguajes y fuerzas vitales que siempre exceden los distintos ataques a las formas de sostenimiento de la vida humana y no humana.

Herein, an uncomplicated ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor was fabricated to detect miR393a, as its detection is of vital importance for plant diseases. A streptavidin-coated screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was fabricated and characterized by scanning electrochemical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and cyclic voltammetry. The two-dimensional (2D) structure and chemical functionality of the streptavidin-coated SPCE render it a superior platform for loading a modified probe via a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-N-hydroxysuccinimide linker. This biorecognition platform is capable of efficiently using its excellent conductivity, greater surface area, and effective electrochemical execution due to its synergistic effect between streptavidin and carbon electrodes. The biosensor showed a good linear response (R 2 = 0.96) to miR393a concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 100a?fM. This streptavidin-based biosensor is highly sensitive to the minimum concentration of miR393a, lowest detection limit, and ultrasensitivity under optimized conditions, i.e., 100 fM, 0.33 fM, and 33.72 A fM-1 cm-2, respectively. In addition, remarkable recoveries could be obtained to confirm the feasibility of this assay in plant disease samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Italian Cancer Society (SIC) conducted a survey on the effect of lockdown on laboratories involved in cancer research in Italy. The survey was completed by 570 researchers at different stages of their career, working in cancer centers, research institutes and universities from 19 Italian regions. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency on face-to-face research activities was high, with a complete (47.7%) or partial (36.1%) shutdown of the laboratories. In the post-lockdown period, research activities were resumed in most of the respondents' institutions (80.4%), though with some restrictions (77.2%). COVID-19 testing was offered to research personnel only in ~50% of research institutions. Overall, the response to the pandemic was fragmented as in many cases institutions adopted different strategies often aimed at limiting possible infections without a clearly defined contingency plan. Nevertheless, research was able to provide the first answers and possible ways out of the pandemic, also with the contribution of many cancer researchers that sacrificed their research programs to help overcome the pandemic by offering their knowledge and technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current persistence of an emergency situation in many European countries, a more adequate organization of research centers will be urgent and necessary to ensure the continuity of laboratory activities in a safe environment.","output":"COVID-19 epidemic strongly affected cancer research in Italy: a survey of the Italian Cancer Society (SIC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2109, and has rapidly spread around the world.

NSAIDs are one of the most commonly prescribed and used pain medications for acute and chronic rheumatic diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and osteoarthritis. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the impact of covid-19 pandemic on NSAIDs prescription. Methods: A cross-sectional web survey was disseminated to all Tunisian rheumatologists through a mailing system and social media. The French version was accessible on Google form. It included close-ended questions about the prescription of NSAIDs during covid-19 pandemic. Participation was anonymous. Data collection and analysis was performed between January the first and January 30, 2021. Results: Among one hundred and thirty Tunisian rheumatologists, thirty responded to the online questionnaire. Ninety percent of participants were women. The mean age of rheumatologists was 34 years [25-57]. The duration of practice was inferior to 5 years in 59.3%, between 5 and 10 years in 18.5%, and superior to 10 years in 22.2% of cases. Sixty-three percent of rheumatologists reported that their activity decreased during covid-19 pandemic. NSAIDs prescription was avoided as much as possible in 40.7% of cases. The participants indicated NSAIDs less frequently in 33.3% of cases, and as much as before the pandemic in one-quarter of cases. Rheumatologists believed that NSAIDs worsen the respiratory symptoms (67%), delay recovery (55%), and increase mortality (48%), hospitalization in intensive care (44%), and infectious complications (33%). The participants suggested that the most incriminated NSAIDs were: Ibuprofen (7.4%), indomethacin (7.4%), celecoxib (7.4%), and diclofenac (3.4%). The majority of rheumatologists (74%) believed that all NSAIDs had a similar risk. For patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatologists replaced NSAIDs with paracetamol and corticoids in 78% and 11% of cases, respectively. If mandatory, reducing NSAIDs doses or duration was an option in 22% and 74% of cases. For patients with SpA, half of rheumatologists did not change the treatment. However, the participants limited the use of NSAIDs or discontinued the treatment in patients with comorbidities. More than 60% of rheumatologists didn't know the effect of NSAIDs in the post-covid-19 syndrome. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic has affected rheumatologists' practice. Rheumatic disease management during this pandemic may be challenging. More evidence is mandatory to standardize treatment prescription, especially with NSAIDs.","output":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during coronavirus 19 pandemic: What do tunisian rheumatologists think?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 has been shown to present more complications in immunosuppressed patients Wedetermine whether differences exist in Covid-19-related mortality between cancer patients and general population inour hospital, and we also describe associated risk factors Methods: We reviewed 2,216 medical records of all patients admitted to hospitalization in Infanta Leonor UniversityHospital in Madrid, Spain, with Covid-19 diagnosis between 5 March and 13 May, 2020 Study data were collectedand managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence in cancerpatients, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors Results: We detected 85/2,216 cancer patients between all Covid-19 diagnoses Mortality rate: 40/85 cancerpatients vs 260/2,131 in general ward (p&lt;0 001) Median age: 76 years old (34-94), 50/85 male patients Mostfrequent histologies were lung cancer (22/85), colorectal cancer (19/85), prostate cancer (15/85), and breast cancer(10/85) Most frequent staging was metastatic disease (32/85) Only 2/85 patients were admitted to ICU Mortality was associated with older median age (79 5 vs 73, p=0 03), high d dimer levels (1630 vs 830, p=0 03), high LDHlevels (315 5 vs 224, p=0 003), bilateral pneumonia (24/42 vs 5/22 with unilateral pneumonia, p=0 02), ARDS(12/13 vs 28/72 without ARDS, p&lt;0 0001), and metastatic disease (20/32 metastatic vs 20/53 non-metastaticpatients, p=0 02) Differences were maintained in multivariate analyses regarding ARDS (OR 23 7, p=0 007) andmetastatic disease (OR 2 5, p=0 05) Conclusions: Covid-19 had a significant mortality in cancer patients High D dimer and LDH levels and ARDSdevelopment in elderly metastatic patients carry an elevated risk of death in cancer patients diagnosed with Covid-19 However, only 2/85 patients were admitted to ICU and these data were decisive It is a priority to createmeasures to avoid Covid-19 transmission in oncologic patients","output":"COVID-CANCER HUIL STUDY:Registry of oncologic patients diagnosed with Covid-19 inInfanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth appears useful to fill in the void for home-ventilated patients to maintain the much-needed connectivity with their healthcare team during the #COVID19 pandemic https://bit.ly/3ftvjxW.","output":"Telehealth: \\"virtual\\" lifeline for home-ventilated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has daunted the world with its enormous impact on healthcare, economic recession, and psychological distress.

DESIGN/SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured TDF\\\\based interviews were conducted with community\\\\based individuals with current or previous experience of long\\\\term BZRA use. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed using the framework method. RESULTS: Twenty\\\\eight individuals were interviewed. Despite commonalities in perceived barriers/facilitators to discontinuing BZRA use within individual TDF domains, individual participants had different experiences of identified determinants of BZRA discontinuation. For example, both similarities and differences existed within and between each participant group in terms of knowledge of the appropriate duration of BZRA use (Knowledge domain) and experience of withdrawal symptoms (Reinforcement domain). Compared to previous users, current users typically anticipated more barriers to discontinuing BZRA use and fewer positive consequences of discontinuation.

METHODS: CM use was studied among a random representative sample (n = 1004) of the adult Dutch population using an online survey conducted from 22C27 May 2020. The survey included a modified version of I-CAM-Q and additional questions on demographic characteristics, reasons for CM use, perceived effectiveness and side effects. RESULTS: 68.0% of the participants reported to have used CM (CM consultations (13.3%), self-management strategies (59.4%), self-help techniques (30.0%)). Most frequently reported reason of CM use was to improve general well-being (61.6%), prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 was only reported by 10%. Perceived effectiveness of CM was high and number of experienced side effects low.

RESULTS: From June to December 2020, 113 subjects with COVID-19 respiratory failure were admitted to our respiratory intermediate care unit. HFNC was applied in 65 subjects (57.52%) and combined therapy in 48 subjects (42.47%). A total of 83 subjects (73.45%) were successfully treated with noninvasive respiratory support. The intubation rate was 26.54%, and the overall mortality rate was 14.15%. The mortality rate in subjects who were intubated was 55.2%. An ROX index of 6.28 at 12 h predicted noninvasive respiratory support failure, with 97.6% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Data from our cohort managed in a respiratory intermediate care unit showed that combined noninvasive respiratory support was feasible, with favorable outcomes.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of infection and can be a dangerous vehicle for the spread of the virus. Furthermore, cancer patients (CPs) are a vulnerable population, with an increased risk of developing severe and lethal forms of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). Therefore, at the National Cancer Institute of Naples, where only cancer patients are treated, a surveillance program aimed to prevent the hospital access of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (HCWs and CPs) was implemented. The study aims to describe the results of the monitoring activity for the SARS-CoV-2 spread among HCWs and CPs, from March 2020 to March 2021. Methods: This surveillance program included a periodic sampling through nasopharyngeal molecular swabs for SARS-CoV-2 (Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, RT-PCR). CPs were submitted to the molecular test at least 48 h before hospital admission. Survival analysis and multiple logistic regression models were performed among HCWs and CPs to assess the main SARS-CoV-2 risk factors. Results: The percentages of HCWs tested with RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, according to the first and the second wave, were 79.7% and 91.7%, respectively, while the percentages for the CPs were 24.6% and 39.6%. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 20 (1.7%) HCWs of the 1204 subjects tested during the first wave, and in 127 (9.2%) of 1385 subjects tested in the second wave (p < 0.001); among CPs, the prevalence of patients tested varied from 100 (4.6%) during the first wave to 168 (4.9%) during the second wave (p = 0.8). The multivariate logistic analysis provided a significant OR for nurses (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.23C4.08, p < 0.001) compared to research, administrative staff, and other job titles. Conclusions: Our findings show that the positivity rate between the two waves in the HCWs increased over time but not in the CPs; therefore, the importance of adopting stringent measures to contain the shock wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hospital setting was essential. Among HCWs, nurses are more exposed to contagion and patients who needed continuity in oncological care for diseases other than COVID-19, such as suspected cancer.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Infection High-Uptake Program on Healthcare Workers and Cancer Patients of the National Cancer Institute of Naples, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surging COVID19 pandemic has underlined the need for quick, sensitive, and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. Although many different methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 particles in clinical material have been developed, none of these assays are successful in combining all three of the above characteristics into a single, easy-to-use method that is suitable for large-scale use. Here we report the development of a direct RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection method that can reliably detect minute quantities of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples as well as the presence of human genomic DNA. An extraction-less validation protocol was carried out to determine performance characteristics of the assay in both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as clinical specimens. Feasibility of the assay and analytical sensitivity was first determined by testing a dilution series of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two different solvents (water and AMIES VTM), revealing a high degree of linearity and robustness in fluorescence readouts. Following analytical performance using synthetic RNA, the limit of detection was determined at equal to or less than 1 SARS-CoV-2 copy/ul of sample in a commercially available sample panel that contains surrogate clinical samples with varying SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Lastly, we benchmarked our method against a reference qPCR method by testing 87 nasopharyngeal swab samples. The direct endpoint ultra-fast RT-PCR method exhibited a positive percent agreement score of 98.5% and a negative percent agreement score of 100% as compared to the reference method, while RT-PCR cycling was completed in 27 minutes/sample as opposed to 60 minutes/sample in the reference qPCR method. In summary, we describe a rapid direct RT-PCR method to detect SARS-CoV-2 material in clinical specimens which can be completed in significantly less time as compared to conventional RT-PCR methods, making it an attractive option for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening applications.","output":"Ultrafast RNA extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection by direct RT-PCR using a rapid thermal cycling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS outbreak in 2003 provides a unique opportunity for the study of human responses to a novel virus. We have previously reported that dendritic cells (DCs) might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for SARS-CoV. In this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), chemokine receptors (CCRs) and death receptor ligands in SARS-CoV infected DCs. We also compared adult and cord blood (CB) DCs to find a possible explanation for the age-dependent severity of SARS. RESULTS: Our results demonstrates that SARS-CoV did not modulate TLR-1 to TLR-10 gene expression but significantly induced the expression of CCR-1, CCR-3, and CCR-5. There was also strong induction of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), but not Fas ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected DCs. Interestingly, the expressions of most genes studied were higher in CB DCs than adult DCs. CONCLUSION: The upregulation of chemokines and CCRs may facilitate DC migration from the infection site to the lymph nodes, whereas the increase of TRAIL may induce lymphocyte apoptosis. These findings may explain the increased lung infiltrations and lymphoid depletion in SARS patients. Further explorations of the biological significance of these findings are warranted.","output":"Toll-like receptors, chemokine receptors and death receptor ligands responses in SARS coronavirus infected human monocyte derived dendritic cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic stress can lead to many systemic complications and low-grade systemic inflammation including increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation and is associated with depression and perceived stress. Elevations can result in weakened immune responses, thereby increasing the risk of complications and mortality from infections. Recent evidence suggests that uncontrolled inflammatory responses associated with COVID-19 are a major determinant of disease severity. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of chronic stress, measured by CRP, on the severity and the length of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective study used medical records from patients admitted to the University Medical Center, El Paso, TX with COVID-19 (n=436 (272M/164F);age 57.3  0.8 years;BMI 29.42  0.3 Kg/m2). Chronic stress was measured by blood CRP level. Severity of COVID-19 infection was determined by the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured during the time of hospitalization. Length of hospitalization was determined by the number of days spent in the hospital. Patients were categorized into low CRP (< 3mg/L) vs. high CRP (> 3mg/L) groups and were compared using unpaired t-test. Results: Patients with high CRP level had greater COVID-19 severity, measured by SpO2 (Low CRP: 94.2%  0.4 vs. high CRP: 91.9%  0.4;p<0.01), and greater length of hospital stay (low CRP: 6.5  1.3 days vs. high CRP 8.8 0.5 days;p<0.05). CRP level was also negatively associated with SpO2 (r= -0.16, p<0.001) and positively associated with the length of hospitalization (r= 0.23, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Higher levels of CRP are associated with worsened severity and increased length of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 receptors in COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of stages 2-5 (predialysis) who do not need renal replacement therapy. Material and methods. A clinical retrospective uncontrolled single-center study included 45 patients (60% of men) with CKD stages 2-5 aged 22-95 years (median - 58 years) hospitalized with predominantly severe uncritical COVID-19 infection. Treatment of COVID-19 was carried out in accordance with the Interim guidelines for the prevention and treatment of new coronavirus infection of the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation. Results. The majority of patients (n=36;73.3%) had CKD stage 3b-5, CKD stage 2 was in 7 (15.5%) and stage 3a - in 5 (11.1%) patients. The median serum creatinine level (Cr) was 164 [131;292] mol/l, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 30 [13;49] ml/min/1.73 m2, CRP 67.5 [37.2;106.75] mg/l. The introduction of monoclonal antibody to IL-6 receptors led to a decrease in the activity of the infectious process (CRP 1.55 [0.33;4.15] mg/l, p<0.001), regression of pneumonia, which did not require mechanical ventilation and hospitalization in the intensive care unit. According to the decision of the medical commission, patients were injected with monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 receptors: tocilizumab (n=36;80%), levilimab (n=2;4.4%), combined therapy with two drugs (n=7;15.5%). Therapy with IL-6 antagonists did not have a negative effect on kidney function. The levels of Cr decreased on average from 224.3145.2 mmol/l at admission to 16092.55 mmol/l at discharge (p<0.001), GFR increased from 32.620.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 at admission to 5331.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 at discharge (p<0.001). In the majority of patients (n=36, 80%) GFR has risen, and only in 9 (20%) cases it remained approximately at the same low level. No serious adverse events have been reported with the use of IL-6 antagonists, as well as concomitant infectious complications. No deaths have been reported. The median length of stay in bed was 14 [10;19] days. Conclusion.

METHODS AND RESULTS Seventy-two women with breast cancer (52  9.8 years) treated with anthracyclines (26 also with trastuzumab), were evaluated for 14 months (6 echocardiograms/12 laboratory tests). We analysed: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, NT-proBNP, global longitudinal strain (GLS), left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiotoxicity was defined as a reduction in LVEF>10% compared with baseline with LVEF<53%. High-sensitivity troponin T levels rose gradually reaching a maximum peak at 96  13 days after starting chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and 62.5% of patients presented increased values during treatment. NT-proBNP augmented after each anthracycline cycle (mean pre-cycle levels of 72  68 pg/mL and post-cycle levels of 260  187 pg/mL; P < 0.0001). Cardiotoxicity was detected in 9.7% of patients (mean onset at 5.2 months). In the group with cardiotoxicity, the LVESV was higher compared with those without cardiotoxicity (40 mL vs. 29.5 mL; P = 0.045) at 1 month post-anthracycline treatment and the decline in GLS was more pronounced (-17.6% vs. -21.4%; P = 0.03). Trastuzumab did not alter serum biomarkers, but it was associated with an increase in LVESV and LVEDV (P < 0.05). While baseline LVEF was an independent predictor of later cardiotoxicity (P = 0.039), LVESV and GLS resulted to be early detectors of cardiotoxicity [odds ratio = 1.12 (1.02-1.24), odds ratio = 0.66 (0.44-0.92), P < 0.05] at 1 month post-anthracycline treatment. Neither high-sensitivity troponin T nor NT-proBNP was capable of predicting subsequent cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS One month after completion of anthracycline treatment is the optimal time to detect cardiotoxicity by means of imaging parameters (LVESV and GSL) and to determine maximal troponin rise. Baseline LVEF was a predictor of later cardiotoxicity. Trastuzumab therapy does not affect troponin values hence imaging techniques are recommended to detect trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.","output":"Early detection of anthracycline- and trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity: value and optimal timing of serum biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the occurrence of prenatal and postnatal anxiety and depression symptoms, and to assess what factors significantly affect the appearance of symptoms of depression and anxiety in young mothers.

Here we show that clofazimine, an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3, possesses pan-coronaviral inhibitory activity, and can antagonize SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems. The FDA-approved molecule was found to inhibit viral spike-mediated cell fusion and viral helicase activity. In a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine significantly reduced viral load in the lung and faecal viral shedding, and also mitigated inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinatorial application of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted upper respiratory tract viral shedding. Since clofazimine is orally bioavailable and has a comparatively low manufacturing cost, it is an attractive clinical candidate for outpatient treatment and remdesivir-based combinatorial therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in developing countries.

This novel optimization method also has relatively few parameters, which makes it potentially valuable for designing multi-wing centrifugal and other types of fans, providing a new idea for energy saving and emission reduction design of fan.","output":"Optimization of Multi-Blade Centrifugal Fan Blade Design for Ventilation and Air-Conditioning System Based on Disturbance CST Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: We searched six databases including three Chinese and three English databases for all the published articles on COVID-19. Studies were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an 8-week program of hypopressive abdominal gymnastics (HAG) on inspiratory muscle strength, diaphragm thickness, disability and pain in patients suffering from non-specific chronic LBP. Methods: A total of 40 patients with chronic LBP were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group carried out an 8-week supervised program of HAG (two sessions/week), whereas the control group did not receive any treatment. Outcomes were measured before and after the intervention, comprising diaphragm thickness during relaxed respiratory activity, maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)), pain intensity (NRS), pressure pain threshold and responses to four questionnaires: Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ), RolandCMorris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11 Items (TSK-11). Results: Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed for greater thickness of the left and right hemi-diaphragms at inspiration, as well as higher PI(max) and decreased NRS, CSI and RMQ scores in the intervention group. After treatment, the increases in the thickness of the left and right hemi-diaphragms at inspiration and PI(max), as well as the decrease in the NRS and RMQ scores, were only predicted by the proposed intervention (R(2) = 0.118C0.552).

METHODS: Daily data on COVID-19 cases registered between February 19 and May 2, 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO)s website. Using an intervention time series modeling, the effect of two government policies on the number of confirmed cases were evaluated, namely the closing of schools and universities, and the implementation of social distancing measures. Furthermore, the effect of the Nowruz holidays as a non-intervention factor for the spread of COVID-19 was also analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that, after the implementation of the first intervention, i.e., the closing of universities and schools, no statistically significant change was found in the number of new confirmed cases. The Nowruz holidays was followed by a significant increase in new cases (1,872.20; 95% CI, 1,257.60 to 2,476.79; p<0.001)), while the implementation of social distancing measures was followed by a significant decrease in such cases (2,182.80; 95% CI, 1,556.56 to 2,809.04; p<0.001).

Increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of the present study was to determine which cytokines are associated with respiratory insufficiency in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Patients and methods Data on 67 consecutive patients were collected between March 8 and March 30, 2020. PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) was calculated at hospital admission. The following cytokines were analysed: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2R; CD25), IL-12, IL-3, interferon (IFN) 2a, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Results P/F lower than 300 was recorded in 22 out of 67 patients (32.8%).

OBJECTIVES: Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. SOURCES: We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. CONTENT: We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options. IMPLICATIONS: The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians.

As the burden of COVID-19 continues to rise, compliance with the use of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items by the public is critical in safeguarding interperson transmissions of the virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out from April to May 2020 on a cross-section of 400 adult Nigerians in a rural hospital in eastern Nigeria. Data collection was done using structured, pretested, and researcher-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire elicited information on drivers, barriers, benefits, and perceived dangers of the use of biosecurity protective items (face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizers). RESULTS: The study participants were aged 18-84 years with a mean age of 53 +/- 11.6 years. There were 214 (53.5%) females. The most common driver of use of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items was government public health legislative directives (400/400) (100.0%). The most common barrier was a denial of the existence of COVID-19 (359/400) (89.8%). The most common benefits were protection from contracting COVID-19 (400/400) (100.0%) and prevent spreading the infection to others (400/400) (100.0%). The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation (400/400) (100.0%) and hand irritation (377/400) (94.3%) for face masks and hand sanitizers, respectively. CONCLUSION: The most common driver was government public health legislative directives. The most common barrier was a denial of the existence of COVID-19, while the predominant benefits were protection from contracting COVID-19 and prevent spreading the infection to others. The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation and hand irritation for masks and sanitizers, respectively.

Selectins are a family of adhesion molecules comprised of L-, E-, and P-selectin. Differences in expression patterns, protein structure, and ligand binding characteristics mediate distinct functions of each selectin. Interactions of selectins and their counter-receptors mediate the first contact of neutrophils with the endothelium, as well as subsequent neutrophil rolling along the endothelial surface. For efficient neutrophil recruitment, activation of (2)-integrins on the cell surface is essential. Integrin activation can be elicited via selectin- as well as chemokine-mediated inside-out signaling resulting in integrin conformational changes and clustering. Dysregulation of selectin-induced integrin activation on neutrophils is involved in the development of severe pathological disease conditions including leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndromes in humans. Here, we review molecular mechanisms involved in selectin-mediated signaling pathways in neutrophils and their impact on integrin activation, neutrophil recruitment, and inflammatory diseases.","output":"Selectin-Mediated SignalingShedding Light on the Regulation of Integrin Activity in Neutrophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many COVID19 pneumonia patients progress to Acute respiratory distress syndrome and end up in Intensive Care Units. Given that it is a novel viral infection, the progress of the disease, its management and associated outcomes are yet to be studied in detail. ARDS associated with COVID 19 is the same as before or different and the timing of intubation in such patients is a topic up for debate. This survey aimed to assess the opinion regarding management of COVID 19 ARDS and the timing of intubation in those patients. Methods: 292 clinicians including anesthesiologists, intensivists and others involved in managing COVID 19 ARDS patients at various centres were surveyed with web-based questionnaire cross sectionally within the time period of 10 th June 2020 to 31 st August 2020 after taking prior consent. Their responses were recorded and analyzed with statistical software IBM SPSS version 25.0. Results: Among 292 included participants, 172 were intensivist, 84 were anesthesiologists and rest were others. Most of the intensivists (51.2%) had seen more than 100 COVID 19 severe ARDS patients. Around 82% of clinicians were agreed that COVID 19 ARDS was different from another form of ARDS. 67.1% of participants were agreed with patient induced self-inflicted injury could have happened in this disease. Likewise, around 91.8% of doctors involved in managing patients were believed that HFNC could be helpful if there were falling of saturation. 37% of participants were not agreed with early intubation, which may increase the risk of mortality and nosocomial infections. Conclusions: and Relevance There was confusion in most doctors with intubation timing even if there was an indication for intubation. These confusions may be due to non-availability of specific recommendation regarding intubation in COVID 19 severe ARDS patients.

In this study, we aimed to present a narrative review on kidney involvement in COVID-19. Kidney involvement could be derived from direct cytopathic effects, immunological mechanisms, indirect effects on renal tissue through other mediators, and dysfunction or injury of other organs. The evolution of COVID-19 may be complicated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a significant percentage of patients, and renal dysfunction seems to be associated with worse prognosis. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more susceptible to the severe forms of COVID-19. Patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) are also a vulnerable population as consequence of their advanced age, underlying comorbidities, impaired immune response, and clustering in hemodialysis centers, with requirements for frequent contact with healthcare services. Kidney transplant patients may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression and comorbidities, hence, managing immunosuppression is imperative. Lastly, renal replacement therapy may be required during COVID-19, and different modalities are discussed based on clinical findings and laboratorial aspects. Therefore, COVID-19 seems to affect kidney by different mechanisms, which contributes for AKI development and increases the severity of the disease.

Numerous studies have examined each construct separately; however, less effort has been dedicated to exploring the impacts in combination. This study sought to describe the cumulative effects on late-life health outcomes. METHOD Survey data collected in 2018-2019 of a randomly sampled population of US older adults, age 65+, were utilized (N = 6,994). Survey measures included loneliness and social isolation using the UCLA-3 Loneliness Scale and Social Network Index. Participants were grouped into four categories based on overlap. Groups were lonely only, socially isolated only, both lonely and socially isolated, or neither. Bivariate and adjusted associations were examined. RESULTS Among participants (mean age = 76.5 years), 9.8% (n = 684) were considered lonely only, 20.6% (n = 1,439) socially isolated only, 9.1% (n = 639) both lonely and socially isolated, and 60.5% (n = 4,232) neither. Those considered both lonely and socially isolated were more likely to be older, female, less healthy, depressed, with lower quality of life and greater medical costs in bivariate analyses. In adjusted results, participants who were both lonely and socially isolated had significantly higher rates of ER visits and marginally higher medical costs. CONCLUSION Results demonstrate cumulative effects of these constructs among older adults. Findings not only fill a gap in research exploring the impacts of loneliness and social isolation later in life, but also confirm the need for approaches targeting older adults who are both lonely and socially isolated.

Compliance with the VAT (value-added tax) regime is addressed in the context described by the two important categories of active legal rules: the rules for consumer protection and the rules related to ensuring data protection. The investigation of the legal framework in this regard started from the presupposition that the necessary changes in regulation for facilitating e-commerce are capable to determine indirect changes in many aspects of financial rules and taxation. While analyzing the regulation of online trade, the various measures undertaken recently in respect to European sources of law and their implications for national legal framework opened additional directions of investigation.

Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.","output":"Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Infection Taking ACEI/ARB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. To understand the changes in plasma proteomics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the protein profiles of plasma samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy volunteers by using the DIA quantitative proteomics technology. We compared and identified differential proteins whose abundance changed upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bioinformatic analyses were then conducted for these identified differential proteins. The GO/KEEG database was used for functional annotation and enrichment analysis. The interaction relationship of differential proteins was evaluated with the STRING database, and Cytoscape software was used to conduct network analysis of the obtained data. A total of 323 proteins were detected in all samples. Difference between patients and healthy donors was found in 44 plasma proteins, among which 36 proteins were up-regulated and 8 proteins were down-regulated. GO functional annotation showed that these proteins mostly composed of cellular anatomical entities and proteins involved in biological regulation, cellular processes, transport, and other processes. KEEG functional annotation further showed that these proteins were mainly involved in complement system activation and infectious disease processes. Importantly, a KEEG pathway (natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity) was enriched, with three important activators of this pathway, ICAM1/2 and IgG, being up-regulated. ProteinCprotein interaction (PPI) statistics indicated that, among these 44 proteins, 6 were the most significantly up-regulated (DBH, SHGB, TF, ICAM2, THBS1, and C1RL) while 2 were the most significantly down-regulated (APCS and ORM1).

Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. RESULTS: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. As home specimen collection options receive regulatory approval, they should be scaled rapidly by health systems.","output":"Willingness to seek laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 with home, drive-through, and clinic-based specimen collection locations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undocumented immigrants have disproportionately suffered during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to factors including limited medical access and financial insecurity, which can exacerbate pandemic-associated distress.

However, pure mathematical methods are typically utilized for production scheduling, which are not understandable and practical for different domain engineers. Moreover, heterogeneous information during production scheduling may result in communication ambiguity or an information delay. Furthermore, the interaction and reuse of production data is limited, owing to the lack of a unified expression of the production information. To overcome these challenges, a model-based systems engineering(MBSE) approach based on the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) is proposed to support production scheduling. A multiple architectural view modeling language, KARMA, is used as the basis to construct production scheduling elements and formalize the production scheduling processes using architecture models. Such graphical models are used to improve the understanding and communication among engineers in different domains. Then, property verification based on the MBSE and SMT is applied to solve the model constraints and select optimal schemes for the production scheduling.

A crucial technical challenge in applying such models is their accurate calibration to observed data, e.g., to the daily number of confirmed new cases, as the past history of the disease strongly affects predictions of future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach based on inversion of the SEIR equations in conjunction with statistical modelling and spline-fitting of the data, to produce a robust methodology for calibration of a wide class of models of this type.","output":"Calibrating COVID-19 SEIR models with time-varying effective contact rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a framework that may help explain the interactions among capitalism, infectious disease, and environmental change in the world and in the Mediterranean region.

This disrupts the environment, most urgently in terms of climate change, which is expected to single out the Mediterranean region for droughts and heat and to lead to mass migrations of people and animals. Capitalism also disrupts the habitats of fauna, and creates factory farming and markets for the sale of animals from local ecologies that are being opened up for profitable useall of which leads to increased interaction between potential vectors of infectious diseases and humans. Capitalist globalization has encouraged widespread international and other travel of people and goods, which can carry infectious people or animal vectors across long distances very rapidly.

Identifying hospital-level factors that contribute to variations in care can provide opportunities to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate variation in post-cardiac arrest care within a large EMS system and explore the contribution of hospital-level factors. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis from a regional cardiac system serving over 10 million persons. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are transported to 36 cardiac arrest centers with 24/7 emergent coronary angiography (CAG) capabilities and targeted temperature management (TTM) policies based on regional guidelines. We included adult patients 18 years with non-traumatic OHCA from 2016-2018. Patients with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order and those who died in the emergency department (ED) were excluded. For the TTM analysis, we also excluded patients who were alert in the ED. The primary outcome was receiving CAG or TTM after cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was neurologic recovery (dichotomized to define a \\"good\\" outcome as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2). We used generalized estimating equations including patient-level factors (age, sex, witnessed arrest, initial rhythm) and hospital-level factors (academic status, hospital size based on licensed beds, annual OHCA patient volume) to estimate the odds ratios associated with these variables. RESULTS There were 7831 patients with OHCA during the study period; 4694 were analyzed for CAG and 3903 for TTM. The median and range for treatment with CAG and TTM after OHCA was 23% (12-49%) and 58% (17-92%) respectively. Hospital size was associated with increased likelihood of CAG, adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.05-2.86, p = 0.03. Academic status approached significance in its association with TTM, adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.91, p = 0.06. Overall, 28% of patients survived with good neurologic outcome, ranging from 17 to 43% across hospitals. CONCLUSION Within this regional cardiac system, there was significant variation in use of CAG and TTM after OHCA, which was not fully explained by patient-level factors. Hospital size was associated with increased CAG.","output":"Variation in Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Within a Regional EMS System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency has led to numerous attempts to assess the impact of the pandemic on population mental health. The findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. METHODS: Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025, recruited 23 March-28 March 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406, recontacts 22 April-1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ); and measures of COVID-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others, as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. RESULTS: A mixed graphical model at wave 1 identified a potential pathway from economic adversity to anxiety symptoms via COVID-specific anxiety. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings, with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown.

Black race, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbidities have been associated with increased severity of disease and need for mechanical ventilation (MV). We examined socioeconomic variables including social support, highest level of education, median income, housing, food insecurity, and employment status, and poverty rate to determine their impact on the need for MV. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 2,038 adult patients with positive SARS-CoV2 test admitted to four large hospitals within the Henry Ford Health System from March 12-April 24 and followed until May 27, 2020. Collected data included patient demographics, employment status, health insurance status, and comorbidities via Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Census tracts were obtained from patient addresses and used to obtain socioeconomic data from the 2018 American Community Survey and the Food Access Research Atlas. The primary outcome assessed was frequency of MV. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed on prehospital variables to identify independent predictors for mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Patients who required MV were significantly more likely to be male (p=0.0006), black race (p=0.012), and have higher CCI (p< 0.0001) and BMI (p< 0.0001). Using census tract data, patients who required MV lived in neighborhoods with lower median income (p< 0.0001), educational attainment (p< 0.0001), and higher levels of food insecurity (p=0.0007). Multivariate analysis revealed male sex, high BMI, CCI, and lower median income to be independent predictors of need for MV. The remaining results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

It consists in applying an electric field (EF) with a frequency of 200 kHz using two pairs of transducer arrays placed on the head. Current should be injected at least 18 h/day and induce a minimum EF intensity of 1 V/cm at the tumor bed for the treatment to be effective. To avoid scalp burns, Optune, the device used to apply this technique in patients, monitors the temperature of the transducers and keeps them below 41 C by reducing the injected current. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the uncertainty associated with the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature of the transducers and of each tissue when TTFields were applied. METHODS: We used a realistic head model, added the two pairs of transducers arrays on the scalp and a virtual lesion, mimicking a glioblastoma tumor in the right hemisphere. Minimum, standard and maximum values for the electric and thermal properties of each tissue were taken from the literature after an extensive review. We used finite element methods (COMSOL Multiphysics) to solve Laplace's equation for the electric potential and Pennes' equation for the temperature distribution. RESULTS: We observed that the electric conductivity of the scalp and skull, as well as scalp's blood perfusion and thermal conductivity were the parameters to which tissue and transducers temperature were most sensitive to. Considering all simulations, scalp's maximum temperature was around 43.5 C, skull's 42 C, CSF's 41.2 C and brain's 39.3 C. According to the literature, for this temperature range, some physiological changes are predicted only for the brain. The average temperature of the transducers varied between 38.1 C and 41.6 C which suggests that modelling TTFields current injection is very sensitive to the parameters chosen. CONCLUSIONS: Better knowledge of the physical properties of tissues and materials and how they change with the temperature is needed to improve the accuracy of these predictions. This information would likely decrease the predicted temperature maxima in the brain and thus help ascertaining TTFields safety from a thermal point of view.","output":"Heat transfer during TTFields treatment: Influence of the uncertainty of the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Due to the lack of clear direction (evidence) on the duration of viral shedding and thus potential for transmission, this retrospective study aimed to come up with a prediction model of prolonged coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) transmission or infection-spreading potential. METHODS: A total of 1211 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, and a prediction model was established. RESULTS: In the training set, 796 patients were divided into the long-term (> 21 days) group (n = 116, 14.6%) and the short-term ( 21 days) group (n = 680, 85.4%) based on their viral shedding duration. Multivariate analysis identified that age > 50 years, comorbidity, CD4-positive T-lymphocytes count (CD4 + T cell)  410 cells/ul, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, and the corticosteroid use were independent risk factors for long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Incorporating the five risk factors, a prediction model, named as the CCCCA score, was established, and its area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.87 in the training set and 0.83 in the validation set, respectively. In the validation set, using a cut-off of 8 points, we found sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 51.7%, 92.2%, 33.3%, and 96.2%, respectively. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding increased from 14/370 (3.8%) in patients with CCCCA < 8 points to 15/45 (33.3%) in patients with CCCCA  8 points.

The current rise in COVID- 19 cases has led to an increasing involvement of hospitals, in order to face the Coronavirus outbreak, shifting healthcare resources towards the management of COVID+ patients. This has led, on the other hand, to a progressive decrease in hospital admissions due to conditions not associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. During COVID-19 outbreak period, it has been observed a decrease in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction. This phenomenon put in serious difficulty the clinical management of COVID-free patients with cardiovascular disease, at the beginning of phase 2 (starting from May 4 2020). Purpose: In this scenario, we aimed to verify the impact of telemedicine during lockdown, in comparison with the same period in 2019. Materials and method: We analyzed 12-lead ECGs recorded by 5000 country pharmacies, evaluated and stored in one telemedicine platform provided by Health Telematic Network (HTN), in cooperation with our Cardiology Department, Federfarma (Pharmacists' National Association), and Italian National Health Institute. Results: During the lockdown period, were recorded 6,104 ECGs in territorial pharmacies, compared to 17,280 ECGs done in the same period in 2019. Chest pain symptom represented the cause of recording ECG in 298 patients (4.88%) during the lockdown period, compared to 402 patients (2.33%) in the same period in 2019, with an increase of 109.86%. In the Lombardy Region, during lockdown period, were reported 118 accesses to territorial pharmacies for chest pain (about 39.50% of total cases in Italy). Among these, 36 accesses were in the province of Brescia (about 30.50%), whereas 28 of them were in the province of Bergamo (about 23.73%). Among ECGs performed, 8 showed typical abnormalities of acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI, 2.68%) in the lockdown period, compared to 7 STEMIs (1.74%) detected in the same period in 2019, with an increase of 54.17%. These patients were referred to Emergency Department (ED) suddenly, for the therapeutic intervention. Conclusion: These data shown that a large number of patients with cardiovascular symptoms preferred to go to territorial pharmacies rather than hospitals during the COVID outbreak period. Telemedicine played a prominent role in managing patients with cardiovascular symptoms at home. Moreover, this service allowed patients with STEMI to access to the hospitals faster, avoiding the risks of a serious diagnostic delay. Furthermore, by analyzing the data of Lombardy Region, it was possible to show how a significant component of access to local pharmacies for chest pain occurred in the region most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Role of telemedicine network provided by pharmacies to detect acute myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain during coronavirus pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic occurred between March 2020 and May 2020 in Japan The first epidemic wave in Chiba prefecture was analyzed based on the case series reported by the official health department of Chiba prefecture The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to a definitive diagnosis by PCR was 6 9 days The number of cases of infection, onset of symptoms, and of definitive diagnosis peaked on March 31, April 2 and April 10, respectively The effective reproduction number was below 1 0 in February, 2 0 to 3 0 between March 17 and March 27, and decreased to under 1 0 again after April 2, 2020 Some patients with an infectious duration of more than 10 days showed an effective reproduction number in the 3 0 to 4 0 range at the peak of the first epidemic","output":"Analysis of the first epidemic wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in Chiba prefecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Phenotypes characterize the clinical manifestations of diseases and provide important information for diagnosis. Therefore, the construction of phenotype knowledge graphs for diseases is valuable to the development of artificial intelligence in medicine. However, phenotype knowledge graphs in current knowledge bases such as WikiData and DBpedia are coarse-grained knowledge graphs because they only consider the core concepts of phenotypes while neglecting the details (attributes) associated with these phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the details of disease phenotypes for clinical guidelines, we proposed a fine-grained semantic information model named PhenoSSU (semantic structured unit of phenotypes). METHODS: PhenoSSU is an entity-attribute-value model by its very nature, and it aims to capture the full semantic information underlying phenotype descriptions with a series of attributes and values. A total of 193 clinical guidelines for infectious diseases from Wikipedia were selected as the study corpus, and 12 attributes from SNOMED-CT were introduced into the PhenoSSU model based on the co-occurrences of phenotype concepts and attribute values. The expressive power of the PhenoSSU model was evaluated by analyzing whether PhenoSSU instances could capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes. To automatically construct fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs, a hybrid strategy that first recognized phenotype concepts with the MetaMap tool and then predicted the attribute values of phenotypes with machine learning classifiers was developed. RESULTS: Fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs of 193 infectious diseases were manually constructed with the BRAT annotation tool. A total of 4020 PhenoSSU instances were annotated in these knowledge graphs, and 3757 of them (89.5%) were found to be able to capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines. By comparison, other information models, such as the clinical element model and the HL7 fast health care interoperability resource model, could only capture the full semantics underlying 48.4% (2034/4020) and 21.8% (914/4020) of the descriptions of phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines, respectively. The hybrid strategy achieved an F1-score of 0.732 for the subtask of phenotype concept recognition and an average weighted accuracy of 0.776 for the subtask of attribute value prediction. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoSSU is an effective information model for the precise representation of phenotype knowledge for clinical guidelines, and machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of constructing PhenoSSU-based knowledge graphs. Our work will potentially shift the focus of medical knowledge engineering from a coarse-grained level to a more fine-grained level.","output":"Constructing High-Fidelity Phenotype Knowledge Graphs for Infectious Diseases With a Fine-Grained Semantic Information Model: Development and Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following self-managed abortion (SMA), or a pregnancy termination attempt outside of the formal health system, some patients may seek care in an emergency department.

METHODS: The study team conducted semi-structured interviews with physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and nurses who had experience with patients presenting with early pregnancy complications in emergency and/or labor and delivery departments in five hospitals near the Texas-Mexico border. Interview questions focused on respondents roles at the hospital, knowledge of abortion services and laws, perspectives on SMA trends, experiences treating patients presenting after SMA, and potential gaps in training related to abortion. Researchers conducted interviews in person between October 2017 and January 2018, and analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Most of the 54 participants interviewed said that the care provided to SMA patients was, and should be, the same as for patients presenting after miscarriage. The majority had treated a patient they suspected or confirmed had attempted SMA; typically, these cases required only expectant management and confirmation of pregnancy termination, or treatment for incomplete abortion. In rare cases, further clinical intervention was required. Many providers lacked clinical and legal knowledge about abortion, including local resources available. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment provided to SMA patients is similar to that provided to patients presenting after early pregnancy loss.

Recently, Function as a Service (FaaS) has emerged as a platform for processing non-interactive tasks. FaaS (such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions) can play an important role in processing scientific workflows. A number of works have demonstrated their ability to process these workflows. However, some issues were identified when workflows executed on cloud functions due to their limits (e.g., stateless behaviour). A major issue is the additional data transfer during the execution between object storage and the FaaS invocation environment. This leads to increased communication costs. DEWE v3 is one of the Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) that already had foundations for processing workflows with cloud functions. In this paper, we have modified the job dispatch algorithm of DEWE v3 on a function environment to reduce data dependency transfers. Our modified algorithm schedules jobs with precedence constraints to be executed in a single function invocation. Therefore, later jobs can utilise output files generated from their predecessor job in the same invocation. This reduces the makespan of workflow execution. We have evaluated the improved scheduling algorithm and the original with small- and large-scale Montage workflows.

However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about how susceptible patients acquire infection from drug-resistant genotypes in the environment. Here, we present a population genomic analysis of 218 A. fumigatus isolates from across the UK and Ireland (comprising 153 clinical isolates from 143 patients and 65 environmental isolates). First, phylogenomic analysis shows strong genetic structuring into two clades (A and B) with little interclade recombination and the majority of environmental azole resistance found within clade A. Second, we show occurrences where azole-resistant isolates of near-identical genotypes were obtained from both environmental and clinical sources, indicating with high confidence the infection of patients with resistant isolates transmitted from the environment. Third, genome-wide scans identified selective sweeps across multiple regions indicating a polygenic basis to the trait in some genetic backgrounds. These signatures of positive selection are seen for loci containing the canonical genes encoding fungicide resistance in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, while other regions under selection have no defined function. Lastly, pan-genome analysis identified genes linked to azole resistance and previously unknown resistance mechanisms. Understanding the environmental drivers and genetic basis of evolving fungal drug resistance needs urgent attention, especially in light of increasing numbers of patients with severe viral respiratory tract infections who are susceptible to opportunistic fungal superinfections.","output":"Population genomics confirms acquisition of drug-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus infection by humans from the environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"rVSV-{Delta}G-SARS-CoV-2-S is a clinical stage (Phase 2) replication competent recombinant vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Within it, we can distinguish four time periods called industrial revolutions. The fourth one of these, which is currently ongoing, is characterized by such ground-breaking inventions as advanced robots, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D printing, automated guided vehicles, cloud technology, augmented reality, big data, blockchain, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. The author argues that under the influence of these inventions, industrial production is gradually becoming fully digitalized, automated, and autonomous. As a consequence, it will be carried out more speedily, flexibly, effectively, and transparently and will be more environmentally friendly. The quality of products will be higher and the costs of their manufacturing lower, and it will be strictly adjusted to the tastes of the consumers. This means that, contrary to the traditional view, represented by Porter, that companies at a given time can only use one of the basic strategies of competition, i.e., low cost, high quality, and market niche, they are able to implement production that meets all three criteria simultaneously. The emergence of the new production paradigm is stimulated by expected economic and environmental benefits as well as political, social, and natural factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors contribute to the breakdown of global supply chains, which causes a tendency to insourcing, which is conditioned by the implementation of intelligent production.","output":"The Change in the Traditional Paradigm of Production under the Influence of Industrial Revolution 4.0"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have investigated the impact of reduced emissions due to COVID-19 lockdown measures in spring 2020 on air quality in Canadas four largest cities: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. Observed daily concentrations of NO(2), PM(2.5), and O(3) during a pre-lockdown period (15 FebruaryC14 March 2020) and a lockdown period (22 MarchC2 May 2020), when lockdown measures were in full force everywhere in Canada, were compared to the same periods in the previous decade (2010C2019). Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO(2) were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM(2.5), Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O(3) all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO(2) surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM(2.5). O(3) surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but O(x) (odd oxygen), like NO(2) and PM(2.5), decreased as expected over these cities.

However, end of life experiences for families are likely to have been deleteriously impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. Understanding how families needs can be met during a global pandemic will have current/future relevance for clinical practice and policy. AIM: To explore relatives experiences and needs when a family member was dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Interpretative qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed thematically. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 19 relatives whose family member died during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: In the absence of direct physical contact, it was important for families to have a clear understanding of their family members condition and declining health, stay connected with them in the final weeks/days of life and have the opportunity for a final contact before they died. Health and social care professionals were instrumental to providing these aspects of care, but faced practical challenges in achieving these. Results are presented within three themes: (1) entering into the final weeks and days of life during a pandemic, (2) navigating the final weeks of life during a pandemic and (3) the importance of saying goodbye in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Health and social care professionals can have an important role in mitigating the absence of relatives visits at end of life during a pandemic. Strategies include prioritising virtual connectedness and creating alternative opportunities for relatives to say goodbye.","output":"A qualitative study of bereaved relatives end of life experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last two decades, an increasing trend towards new forms of dental practice was observed [...].","output":"Changing Dental ProfessionModern Forms and Challenges in Dental Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, best known for causing diarrhea in humans and are also found in many other mammals; in those, the relevance in gastroenteritis remains unclear. Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot cross-sectional survey study included the general population, health care workers, and health care workers who are deaf or hard of hearing in the United States. Volunteers were sampled via an opt-in survey panel and nonrandomized convenience sampling. The general population survey was conducted between January 5 and January 8, 2021. The health care worker surveys were conducted between December 3, 2020, and January 3, 2021. Respondents viewed 2 short videos of a study author wearing both a standard and transparent N95 mask and answered questions regarding mask use, communication, preference, and fit. Surveys took 15 to 20 minutes to complete. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants perceptions were assessed surrounding the use of both mask types related to communication and the ability to express emotions. RESULTS: The national survey consisted of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [18.5] years; 496 [49.6%] women) with a response rate of 92.25%. The survey of general health care workers consisted of 123 participants (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [9.0] years; 84 [68.3%] women), with a response rate of 11.14%. The survey of health care workers who are deaf or hard of hearing consisted of 45 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [9.0] years; 30 [66.7%] women) with a response rate of 23.95%.

Control efforts are hindered by fast virus transmission, insecticide-resistant populations, and a wide host range which permits large natural reservoirs for whiteflies. Augmentative biocontrol by parasitoids while effective in suppressing high population densities in greenhouses falls short when it comes to preventing virus transmission and is ineffective in the open field.

In this work, the spread of Covid-19 is modelled as a differentiable game between the planner and population with appropriate disease spread dynamical equations. We first characterise the equilibrium dynamics of only the population with modifed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) equations to highlight the qualitative nature of the equilbrium. Using this result, we formulate the joint equilibrium exposure profile between the planner and population. Additionally, as in case of Covid-19, the role of asymptomatic carriers, inadequacies in testing, contact tracing and quarantining can lead to a significant underestimate of the true infected numbers as compared to just the detected numbers. Therefore, it is vital to model the true infected numbers within the context of choices made by individuals within the population. To incorporate this, we extend our framework by modifying the dynamics to include additional sub-compartments of \`undetected infected' and \`detected infected' in the disease dynamics. The individuals make their own estimates of the total infected from the detected numbers and base their strategies on those estimates. We show that these considerations lead to a retarded optimal control problem for the players. We present some simulation results based on these results to demonstrate how population behavior, planner control, detection rates and trust in the reported numbers play a key role in how the disease spreads.","output":"Differential Games in the spread of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The number of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) analyses performed for planning structural heart interventions is rapidly increasing. Further automation is required to save time, increase standardization, and reduce the learning curve. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based MSCT analysis for planning structural heart interventions, focusing on left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) as the selected use case. Methods Different deep learning models were trained, validated, and tested using a cohort of 583 patients for which manually annotated data were available. These models were used independently or in combination to detect the anatomical ostium, the landing zone, the mitral valve annulus, and the fossa ovalis and to segment the left atrium (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA). The accuracy of the models was evaluated through comparison with the manually annotated data. Results The automated analysis was performed on 25 randomly selected patients of the test cohort. The results were compared to the manually identified landmarks. The predicted segmentation of the LA(A) was similar to the manual segmentation (dice score of 0.94  0.02). The difference between the automatically predicted and manually measured perimeter-based diameter was -0.8  1.3 mm (anatomical ostium), -1.0  1.5 mm (Amulet landing zone), and -0.1  1.3 mm (Watchman FLX landing zone), which is similar to the operator variability on these measurements. Finally, the detected mitral valve annulus and fossa ovalis were close to the manual detection of these landmarks, as shown by the Hausdorff distance (3.9  1.2 mm and 4.8  1.8 mm, respectively). The average runtime of the complete workflow, including data pre- and postprocessing, was 57.5  34.5 seconds. Conclusions A fast and accurate AI-based workflow is proposed to automatically analyze MSCT images for planning LAAO.

DESIGN: Causal mediation analysis. SETTING: Retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 30 November 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 30 November 2020 (n=10,078,568). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios were estimated for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographic factors, socioeconomic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. RESULTS: Living in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.30) and 1.21 (95% CI 1.06-1.38) for elderly men and women. The hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.07 (95% CI 1.01-1.13) for elderly men and 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.25) for elderly women. Living in a multi-generational household explained about 11% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among elderly women from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian men or people in other ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSION: Elderly adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian women compared to White women.

The first step was to evaluate the salt added to food through atomic emission spectrophotometry in both canteens, and the second step was to perform gradual reductions of up to 30% of cooking salt in the intervention canteen using the Salt Control-C (SC-C) equipment. Consumer acceptability was assessed through satisfaction questionnaires and food waste was evaluated by weighing. Results: The intervention canteen achieved to a reduction of more than 30% of added salt in soup (?34.3% per 100 g), fish dish (?41.1% per 100 g) and meat dish (?48.0% per 100 g), except for the vegetarian dish (6.1% per 100 g). There was no decrease in consumer satisfaction, with a significant satisfaction increase of 15.7% (p = 0.044) regarding the flavor of the main dish.

The IgG-IgM serological assay has demonstrated good accuracy in early detection in symptomatic patients, but its role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is uncertain. The aim of our study was to assess IgM and IgG prevalence in sera in a large cohort of HCWs previously subjected to Nasopharyngeal swab test (NST) after accurate risk assessment due to positive COVID-19 patient exposure during an observation period of 90 days. METHODS: 2407 asymptomatic HCWs that had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the period between April 8th and June 7(th) were screened with NST based on the RT-PCR method. In parallel, they underwent large-scale chemiluminescence immunoassays involving IgM-IgG serological screening to determine actual viral spread in the same cohort. RESULTS: During the 90-day observation period, 18 workers (0.75%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the NST, whereas the positivity rates for IgM and IgG were 11.51% and 2.37%, respectively (277 workers). Despite high specificity, serological tests were inadequate for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with previous positive NST results (IgM and IgG sensitivities of 27.78% and 50.00%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a widespread low viral load of SARS-CoV-2 among hospital workers. However, serological screening showed very low sensitivity with respect to NST in identifying infected workers, and negative IgG and IgM results should not exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. IgG-IgM chemiluminescence immunoassays could increase the diagnosis of COVID-19 only in association with NST, and this association is considered helpful for decision-making regarding returning to work.","output":"Large-scale IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 serological screening among healthcare workers with a low infection prevalence based on nasopharyngeal swab tests in an Italian university hospital: perspectives for public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia is a common complication of a colostomy. Ultimately, one-third of patients with a parastomal hernia will need surgical correction due to frequent leakage or life-threatening bowel obstruction or strangulation. However, treatment remains a challenge resulting in high recurrence rates. Two single center trials demonstrated that the frequency of parastomal hernias decreases by prophylactic placement of a mesh around the stoma at the time of formation. Unfortunately, both studies were small-sized, single-center studies and with these small numbers less common complications could be missed which were the reasons to initiate a prospective randomized multicenter trial to determine if a retromuscular, preperitoneal mesh at the stoma site prevents parastomal hernia and does not cause unacceptable complications. METHODS One hundred and fifty patients undergoing open procedure, elective formation of a permanent end-colostomy will be randomized into two groups. In the intervention group an end-colostomy is created with placement of a preperitioneal, retromuscular lightweight monofilament polypropylene mesh, and compared to a group with a traditional stoma without mesh. Patients will be recruited from 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during a 2-year period. Primary endpoint is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are stoma complications, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Follow-up will be performed at 3 weeks, 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. To find a difference of 20% with a power of 90%, a total number of 134 patients must be included. All results will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 statement.

However, it is unknown how long protective immunity lasts. Current guidelines recommend vaccination of recovered patients even though data regarding vaccine effectiveness in such cases are still limited. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed electronic medical records from a large health care organization in Israel to assess reinfection rates in patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection before any vaccination against Covid-19. We compared reinfection rates among patients who had subsequently received the BNT162b2 vaccine (PfizerCBioNTech) and those who had not been vaccinated between March 1 and November 26, 2021. We used a Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates to estimate the association between vaccination and reinfection after adjustment for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the vaccine effectiveness of one dose as compared with two doses. RESULTS: A total of 149,032 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection met the eligibility criteria. Of these patients, 83,356 (56%) received subsequent vaccination during the 270-day study period. Reinfection occurred in 354 of the vaccinated patients (2.46 cases per 100,000 persons per day) and in 2168 of 65,676 unvaccinated patients (10.21 cases per 100,000 persons per day). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 84) among patients who were 16 to 64 years of age and 60% (95% CI, 36 to 76) among those 65 years of age or older. No significant difference in vaccine effectiveness was found for one dose as compared with two doses. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had recovered from Covid-19, the receipt of at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrent infection.","output":"Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Vaccine after Recovery from Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-related laboratory shutdowns are sure to cause a myriad of problems with liquid chromatography (LC) instrumentation across the globe.

Methods: Records of 188 patients who underwent surgery in our neurosurgery clinic during the first wave of the pandemic in Turkey (March 11-31 May 2020) were examined retrospectively. Characteristics of the operations performed, COVID-19 tests performed and results, intraoperative measures taken and frequency of COVID-19 symptoms among neurosurgeons after the surgery were determined. Results: Of the 188 patients included in the study, none had a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 at the time of surgery.

The number of total views, views per day, likes, dislikes, comments, video length, date of video upload and duration on YouTube was recorded. Finally, a total of 136 relevant English videos were included in the study. A 5-point modified DISCERN tool was used to assess reliability, whereas a 5-point Global Quality score (GQS) was used to evaluate quality. Cohen's kappa score was used to determine inter-rater agreement, while the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate inter-observer reliability. Results: All videos had a high DISCERN score [4, interquartile range (IQR) (3-5)] and GQS [5, IQR (4-5)] in general. Moreover, 20 (14.7%) videos containing information about sexual life and effects of COVID-19 on sperm were described as debated. Videos uploaded by universities/ professional organisations/non-profit physician/physician groups had higher scores (p<0.001). However, their rates of number of views per day (p=0.036) and likes (p<0.001) were lower. The majority of videos related to urology (63.9%) included conversations about andrological disorders. The median number of total views and number of views per day were also highest for videos related to andrology. Conclusion: Although andrological disorders are classified as a non-essential issue and andrological consultations are postponed during the COVID-19 period, the results show that the rate of YouTube videos related to andrology is even higher than uro-oncological diseases during this period. Therefore, it is important to share accurate and reliable information in this field. Our analysis shows that informative, easy-to-understand YouTube videos uploaded by universities/professional organisations/non-profit physicians/physician groups can be used as an additional method to telemedicine, especially for andrological disorders that do not require follow-up.","output":"Can youtube video on urological problems be used as an additional resource in telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A number of immunoassays have been developed to measure antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. More data is required on their comparability, particularly amongst those with milder infections and in the general practice population. The aim of this study was to compare four high throughput automated anti SARS-CoV-2 assays using samples collected from hospitalised patients and healthcare workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we collected general practice samples to compare antibody results and determine seroprevalence. METHODS Samples were collected from 57 hospitalised patients and 9 healthcare workers at 14 days and at 28 days following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were also collected from 225 patients presenting to general practice. Four assays were used: Abbott Architect IgG, Beckman Coulter DxI 800 IgG, Roche Cobas e801 total antibody and Siemens Advia Centaur XPT total antibody. RESULTS All 4 assays showed concordance at 14 days in 83.9% of hospitalised patients and in 66.7% of healthcare workers. All 4 assays showed concordance at 28 days in 88.4% of hospitalised patients and 77.8% of healthcare workers. The sensitivity to detect recent infection was higher for the IgG assays than the total assays. All 4 assays showed concordance of 95.1% in the general practice population. Seroprevalence ranged from 4.9-5.8% depending on the assay used. CONCLUSIONS All 4 assays showed excellent comparability but it may be possible to obtain a negative result for any of the anti SARS-CoV-2 assays in patients with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hence, a prompt and correct clinical decision not only is critical for patients prognosis, but also can help when making collective decisions regarding hospital resource management. In this work, we present a network-based high-level classification technique to help healthcare professionals on this activity, by detecting early signs of insufficiency based on Complete Blood Count (CBC) test results. We start by building a training dataset, comprising both CBC and specific tests from a total of 2,982 COVID-19 patients, provided by a Brazilian hospital, to identify which CBC results are more effective to be used as biomarkers for detecting early signs of insufficiency. Basically, the trained classifier measures the compliance of the test instance to the pattern formation of the network constructed from the training data. To facilitate the application of the technique on larger datasets, a network reduction option is also introduced and tested. Numerical results show encouraging performance of our approach when compared to traditional techniques, both on benchmark datasets and on the built COVID-19 dataset, thus indicating that the proposed technique has potential to help medical workers in the severity assessment of patients.

The photocatalytic activities of both composites were then investigated through degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. It was found that CuTEPyP/TNTAs could eliminate 95% 4-NP within 4 h, which was considerably higher than the yield obtained with CuTEPyP/TNTs (56%) under the same conditions. Compared to CuTEPyP/TNTs, the improved photocatalytic activity of CuTEPyP/TNTAs can be ascribed to increased light absorption, high separation rate of photo-generated charge pairs, and efficient charge transfer. A plausible photocatalytic degradation mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical anions and singlet oxygen species was also proposed.

They contribute to the literature by hypothesizing and testing the idea that importing activities can foster the introduction of product, process, marketing and organizational innovations in emerging market firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a combination of two economic surveys that included 1,347 Chilean companies. To test their hypotheses, they applied a variant of the Crpon-Duguet-Mairesse (CDM) model (Crpon et al., 1998) accounting for technological and non-technological innovation outputs. Specifically, four alternative innovation output indicators were used to measure the introduction of product, process, marketing and organizational innovations. Findings: The results revealed that importing activities had positive effects on technological and non-technological innovation. Importers showed a significant advantage in the introduction of product, marketing and organizational innovations. Firms that both import and export (i.e. two-way traders) had an even greater advantage in the introduction of new or significantly improved products. Originality/value: The authors demonstrated a relationship between importing activities and both technological and non-technological innovation that is novel and relevant, particularly at a historical moment when COVID-19 poses huge economic challenges to emerging market firms. As trade disruptions caused by the pandemic have predisposed some governments to favor protectionist policies, the authors warn that erecting barriers against imports can hamper the innovative success of local businesses. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The effects of importing activities on technological and non-technological innovation: evidence from Chilean firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged as the cause of a global crisis. Rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis is essential for effectively controlling transmission. The gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 identification is the highly sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); however, this assay depends on specialized reagents and may suffer from false results. Thus, additional assays based on different approaches could be beneficial. Here, we present a novel method for SARS-CoV-2 identification based on mass spectrometry. The approach we implemented combines a multistep procedure for the rational down-selection of a set of reliable markers out of all optional in silico derived tryptic peptides in viral proteins, followed by monitoring of peptides derived from tryptic digests of purified proteins, cell-cultured SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix spiked with the virus. The marker selection was based on specificity to SARS-CoV-2 and on analytical parameters including sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility. The final assay is based on six unique and specific peptide markers for SARS-CoV-2 identification. The simple and rapid (2.5 h) protocol we developed consists of virus heat inactivation and denaturation, tryptic digestion, and identification of the selected markers by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The developed assay enabled the identification of 10(4) PFU/mL SARS-CoV-2 spiked into buffer. Finally, the assay was successfully applied to 16 clinical samples diagnosed by RT-qPCR, achieving 94% concordance with the current gold standard assay. To conclude, the novel MS-based assay described here is specific, rapid, simple, and is believed to provide a complementary assay to the RT-qPCR method.","output":"Specific and Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Identification Based on LC-MS/MS Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not only attacking our physical health, but it is also increasing psychological suffering. This study aimed to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among patients with mild to moderate illness in Fangcang shelter hospitals. Methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China. The participants were assessed by quantifying their symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stressful life events and analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Using correlation analysis, we examined associations between exposure to COVID-19 and subsequent psychological distress in response to the outbreak. Results: In total, 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms. The depressive and anxiety symptoms were highly related to sleep disturbances and hypochondriasis (all r > 0.50, P < 0.01). The impact of the event was positively related to depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis and life events (all r > 0.35, P < 0.01) but was negatively related to psychological resilience (r = -0.41, P < 0.01).

Loneliness is also a concern in older adulthood as many experience the loss of close others and smaller social networks. Loneliness is well-established as being associated with higher stress levels in younger adults, but there are mixed findings on the impact in older adulthood. Furthermore, while older adults may engage in behaviors designed to reduce and manage stress, it is not known whether these behaviors modulate the relationship between loneliness and chronic stress. The current study examined the relationship between loneliness and stress in older adulthood and the degree to which stress-management moderated this relationship (note: data collected prior to COVID-19 pandemic). We hypothesized that loneliness and perceived stress would be positively associated, but that stress-management would moderate this relationship.

However, inconsistency and ambiguity in instructions show a lack of definitive knowledge on best spray use techniques. In this study, we have identified a new usage strategy for nasal sprays available over-the-counter, that registers an average 8-fold improvement in topical delivery of drugs at diseased sites, when compared to prevalent spray techniques. The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare.","output":"Numerical evaluation of spray position for improved nasal drug delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cohort was ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) with peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) and mostly involving one or two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied by characteristic signs. After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue. The evolution of lesions on CT imaging were observed in 10 patients (17.2%).

Clinical Research Associates are a largely unexplored source for informing understanding of potential causes of missing PRO data. The purpose of this qualitative research was to describe factors that influence missing PRO data, as revealed through the lived experience of CRAs. METHODS: Maximum variation sampling was used to select CRAs having a range of experiences with missing PRO data from academic or nonacademic centers in different geographic locations of Canada. Semistructured interviews were audio\\\\recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed according to descriptive phenomenology. RESULTS: Eleven CRAs were interviewed. Analysis revealed several factors that influence missing PRO data that were organized within themes. PROs for routine clinical care compete with PROs for RCTs. Both the paper and electronic formats have benefits and drawbacks. Missing PRO data are influenced by characteristics of the instruments and of the patients. Assessment of PROs at progression of disease is particularly difficult. Deficiencies in center research infrastructure can contribute. CRAs develop relationships with patients that may help reduce missing PRO data. It is not always possible to provide sufficient time to complete the instrument. There is a need for field guidance and a motivation among CRAs to contribute their knowledge to address issues.

In total, 4341 persons in four different areas, including visitors to performances of classical music and musicals, as well as professional and amateur musicians, have participated in this survey. Results show rates of 86% recovered from the COVID-19 virus or vaccinated at least once, with 54.5% fully vaccinated. These vaccination rates were considerably higher compared to the general population. An attitude of hesitation towards vaccination found in 6.4% of those sampled was half that of the general population. These findings drawn from a large sample indicate that in the field of music a high vaccination rate is to be found, as well as a low rejection rate of vaccination on the part of the audience and performers.

It takes up a large number of healthcare resources. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on patients with ovarian cancer by comprehensively analyzing their admissions before and after the epidemic, and made reasonable suggestions to improve their current situation. Methods: We randomly divided the enrolled patients into three groups, PreCOVID-19 Group (PCG) (2019.8.20C2020.1.20), COVID-19 Group (CG) (2020.1.21C2020.6.14), and Secondary Outbreak COVID-19 Group (SOCG) (2020.6.15C2020.10.10). One-way ANOVA and chi-square test were used for analysis. Results: The number of patients from other provinces decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The total hospital stay during the epidemic was substantially more extended (p < 0.05). Before the epidemic, our department performed more open surgery while during the epidemic outbreak, we tended to choose laparoscopy (p < 0.01). We took a longer surgery time (P < 0.05). Patients had significantly less post-operative fever during the epidemic (p < 0.001). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, no patient was infected with COVID-19, and no patient experienced severe post-operative complications. We recommend maintaining the admissions of patients with ovarian cancer during the epidemic following the rules: 1. The outpatients must complete a nucleic acid test and chest CT in the outpatient clinic; 2. Maintain full daily disinfection of the ward and insist that health care workers disinfect their hands after contact with patients; 3. Increase the use of minimally invasive procedures, including laparoscopy and robotics; 4. Disinfect the ward twice a day with UV light and sodium hypochlorite disinfectant; 5.

Despite the presence of different COVID-19 vaccines, the discovery of proper antiviral therapeutics is an urgent necessity. Nature is considered as a historical trove for drug discovery, especially in global crises. During our efforts to discover potential anti-SARS CoV-2 natural therapeutics, screening our in-house natural products and plant crude extracts library led to the identification of C. benedictus extract as a promising candidate. To find out the main chemical constituents responsible for the extracts antiviral activity, we utilized recently reported SARS CoV-2 structural information in comprehensive in silico investigations (e.g., ensemble docking and physics-based molecular modeling). As a result, we constructed proteinCprotein and proteinCcompound interaction networks that suggest cnicin as the most promising anti-SARS CoV-2 hit that might inhibit viral multi-targets. The subsequent in vitro validation confirmed that cnicin could impede the viral replication of SARS CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 1.18 g/mL. Furthermore, drug-like property calculations strongly recommended cnicin for further in vivo and clinical experiments. The present investigation highlighted natural products as crucial and readily available sources for developing antiviral therapeutics. Additionally, it revealed the key contributions of bioinformatics and computer-aided modeling tools in accelerating the discovery rate of potential therapeutics, particularly in emergency times like the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Cnicin as an Anti-SARS-CoV-2: An Integrated In Silico and In Vitro Approach for the Rapid Identification of Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 brought about long-lasting changes to all aspects of our daily lives.

However, numerous imitation research has indicated that conventional PPE cannot adequately protect healthcare personnel. Since then, numerous firms and healthcare professionals have created their personal reformed devices 'aerosol containment devices' (ACD). Their usage has expanded throughout the world without being properly evaluated for usefulness, efficacy, or safety. The practice of 'ACD' has been shown to make tracheal intubation (TI) more problematic in several simulated tests. Furthermore, the device should limit the transmission of droplets from a patient; however, it might put healthcare personnel at danger of being exposed to greater levels of viral aerosols.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists' employment status, workload, and feelings of burnout, as well as to examine emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. METHODS: Wisconsin pharmacists were surveyed using an online instrument between August 25, 2020, and September 22, 2020. The data analysis, performed in December 2020, examined employment status, 3 common burnout risk factors (workload, rewards, and social depersonalization), and emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1300 pharmacists, 439 completed the survey (33.8%). The study analysis included pharmacists in community (n = 127) and hospital or health system (n = 107) settings. With regard to employment changes and workload, hospital pharmacists (36%) were more likely to have their hours reduced than community pharmacists (13%) (P < 0.01), and, conversely, community pharmacists (19%) were more likely to have their hours increased than hospital pharmacists (8%) (P = 0.01). For the burnout domain of workload, 45% of the pharmacists reported increased feelings of physical exhaustion at work, and 53% reported increased feelings of emotional exhaustion at work, with no difference between settings. Regarding the burnout domain of rewards, 6% of the hospital pharmacists and 1% of the community pharmacists experienced a reduction in hourly wages or salaries as a result of COVID-19. For the burnout domain of depersonalization, 25% of the pharmacists reported that their ability to connect with colleagues and patients decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4(+) T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8(+) T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4(+) T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4(+) T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to -coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults.

To date, bio-adhesives have mainly been used as haemostats and tissue sealants, while their application in permanently contracting and sealing hyperinflated lung tissue has recently been identified as a novel and enticing opportunity. However, a major drawback of the current adhesive technology is the induction of severe inflammatory responses and adverse events upon administration. In our review, we distinguish between and discuss various natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic tissue haemostats and sealants that have been used for pulmonary applications such as sealing air/fluid leaks. Furthermore, we present an overview of the different materials including AeriSeal and autologous blood that have been used to achieve lung volume reduction and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. In conclusion, we describe the key biological (therapeutic benefit and biocompatibility) and biomechanical (degradability, adhesive strength, stiffness, viscoelasticity, tunability and self-healing capacity) characteristics that are essential for an ideal lung bio-adhesive material with the potential to overcome the concerns related to current adhesives.","output":"Crosslink bio-adhesives for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction: current status and future direction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat of an H5N1 influenza virus (avian flu) pandemic is substantial, and an effective response is contingent upon effective coordination among state and local public health authorities and individual health care providers.

In June 2020 Orthopaedic ICATS in The Belfast Trust in collaboration with Spinal Surgeon Mr. Darwish established a monthly Spine Mini-Mega Clinic. The main triggers for the clinic were the extensive spinal waiting list in Northern Ireland and improving the spinal orthopaedic journey for patients. The Mini-Mega Clinic model is in line with the Department of Health Rebuilding, Transition and Transformation of Elective Orthopaedic Care in Northern Ireland (DOH, July 2020). While the clinic is successful in assessing a large number of patients in a short time, patient centered care remains paramount with clinicians mindful that many of the patients have been waiting years for an appointment. The clinic also provides an educational opportunity for ICATS clinicians and increases clinician's confidence. The establishment of the Spine Mini-Mega Clinic builds on the previously successful Northern Ireland Regional Spine Mega Clinics, Co-located ICATS Clinics and the Virtual Consultant Spinal Opinion. The Mini-Mega Clinic is now built into the ICATS job plan and also affords Mr. Darwish protected time to manage the monthly ICATS spinal surgical queries. Methods: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, patients on the Spinal Surgical Waiting List had a virtual consultation with an ICATS clinician. Potential surgical candidates with clinical symptoms concordant with MRI findings are discussed with Mr. Darwish who makes a decision on the most appropriate management. The ICATS team also refer new patients to the clinic who they deem to be potential surgical candidates following appropriate orthopaedic work-up. Results: Seven clinics were delivered between June 2020 and February 2021 with 493 patients seen. 329 patients (67%) were from the Regional Spinal Waiting List and 164 patients (33%) were referred by ICATS. Results show that 74% of waiting list patients were discharged with no further orthopaedic follow-up. Conversely 65% of ICATS referrals were boarded for surgery and only 15% were discharged. This supports the Single Point of Referral via Orthopaedic ICATS advocated in The Regional Spinal Pathway (2016) and demonstrates the high level at which ICATS clinicians are working to support consultants. Conclusion(s): The Spinal Mini-Mega Clinic has proven to be a highly effective model in assessing a large number of patients in a short time and therefore significantly impacting on waiting lists. There is a high discharge rate of Spinal Waiting List Patients. The clinic is cost effective and optimises the use of consultant time, it improves the patient journey for new patients and it provides education and upskilling of ICATS clinicians. The clinic also highlights the value and skills of the ICATS Advanced Practice Physiotherapists and how their skills can be utilised to reduce the demand on consultant clinics and streamline waiting lists. Impact: Other Trusts are now utilising a similar model with designated spinal consultant support for a virtual consultant opinion therefore reducing unnecessary referrals being added to the waiting list. The Mini-Mega Clinic model has potential to be utilised for other body parts to impact the ever increasing orthopaedic waiting lists.

LBP is not attributable to a known diagnosis in 85% of the cases and therefore called chronic non-specific LBP (cnLBP). Passive immersion in warm water is commonly claimed to reduce muscular tension and pain, but not yet sufficiently investigated with regard to cnLBP. The current study compares three passive aquatic interventions regarding their effects on cnLBP: floating (resting in a supine immersed position on flotation devices), WATSU (a passive hands-on treatment, in which a practitioner stands in warm water, gently moving and massaging the client), and a Spa session. METHODS: In this randomized cross-over clinical trial, all 24 adult participants with cnLBP will undergo the three interventions in balanced order with a washout-period of at least two weeks in between. Assessments will take place at baseline and follow-up of study and immediately before and after each intervention. Assessments cover the primary outcome self-reported current pain (Visual Analog Scale, range: 0C100 mm), other self-report questionnaires (addressing, e.g., personality traits or -states), and physiological parameters (e.g., measurement of spinal range of motion). DISCUSSION: The study adds estimates of intervention-specific effect-sizes of widespread passive aquatic interventions to cnLBP. The study also points to potential underlying pain-reducing mechanisms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton Bern (ProjectID: 2018C00461).

The Alu-fusion-mediated loss-of-function of CMAH fixed 2C3 Ma, possibly contributing to the origins of the genus Homo. The mutation likely altered human self-associated molecular patterns, triggering multiple events, including emergence of human-adapted pathogens with strong preference for Neu5Ac recognition and/or presenting Neu5Ac-containing molecular mimics of human glycans, which can suppress immune responses via CD33-related-Siglec engagement. Human-specific alterations reported in some gene-encoding Sia-sensing proteins suggested a hotspot in hominin evolution. The availability of more hominid genomes including those of two extinct hominins now allows full reanalysis and evolutionary timing. Functional changes occur in 8/13 members of the human genomic cluster encoding CD33-related Siglecs, all predating the human common ancestor. Comparisons with great ape genomes indicate that these changes are unique to hominins. We found no evidence for strong selection after the HumanCNeanderthal/Denisovan common ancestor, and these extinct hominin genomes include almost all major changes found in humans, indicating that these changes in hominin sialobiology predate the NeanderthalChuman divergence 0.6 Ma. Multiple changes in this genomic cluster may also explain human-specific expression of CD33rSiglecs in unexpected locations such as amnion, placental trophoblast, pancreatic islets, ovarian fibroblasts, microglia, Natural Killer(NK) cells, and epithelia. Taken together, our data suggest that innate immune interactions with pathogens markedly altered hominin Siglec biology between 0.6 and 2 Ma, potentially affecting human evolution.","output":"Multiple Genomic Events Altering Hominin SIGLEC Biology and Innate Immunity Predated the Common Ancestor of Humans and Archaic Hominins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of the study is to map the funding status of COVID-19 research. The various aspects, such as funding ratio, geographical distribution of funded articles, journals publishing funded research and institutions that sponsor the COVID-19 research are studied. To visualize the country collaboration network and research trends/hotspots in the field of COVID-19 funded research, keyword analysis is also performed. The open-access (OA) status of the funded research on COVID-19 is also discussed. Design/methodology/approach The leading indexing and abstracting database, i.e. Web of Science (WoS), was used to retrieve the funded articles published on the topic COVID-19. The scientometric approach, more particularly \\"funding acknowledgment analysis (FAA),\\" was used to study the research funding. Findings A total of 5,546 publications of varied nature have been published on COVID-19, of which 1,760 are funded, thus indicating a funding ratio of 32%. China is the leading producer of funded research (760, 43.182%) on COVID-19 followed by the USA (482, 27.386%), England (179, 10.17%), Italy (119, 6.761%), Germany (107, 6.08%) and Canada (107, 6.08%). China is also in lead in terms of the funding ratio (60.94%). However, the funding ratio of the USA (31.54%) is at 11th rank behind Canada (40.68%), Germany (34.18%) and England (35.87%). The USA occupies a central position in the collaboration network having the highest score of articles with other countries (n = 489), with the USA-China collaboration ranking first (n = 123). National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) is the largest source of funding for COVID-19 research, supporting 342 (19.432%) publications, followed by the United States Department of Health Human Services (DHHS) and National Institute of Health (NIH), USA with 211 (11.989%) and 200 (11.364%) publications, respectively. However, China's National Key Research and Development Program achieves the highest citation impact (80.24) for its funded publications. Journal of Medical Virology, Science of the Total Environment and EuroSurveillance are the three most prolific journals publishing 63 (3.58%), 35 (1.989%) and 32 (1.818%), respectively, of the sponsored research articles on the COVID-19. A total of 3,138 institutions produce funded articles with Huazhong University of Science Technology and Wuhan University from China at the forefront publishing 92 (5.227%) and 83 (4.716%) publications, respectively. The funded research on COVID-19 is largely available in OA mode (1,674, 95.11%) and mainly through the Green and Bronze routes. The keyword clustering reveals that the articles mainly focus on the impact, structure and clinical characteristics of the virus. Research limitations/implications The study's main limitation is that the results are based on the publications indexed by WoS, which has limited coverage compared to other databases. Moreover, all the funding agencies do not require or authors miss to acknowledge funding sources in their publications, which ultimately undermines the number of funded publications. The research publications on COVID-19 are also proliferating;thus, the study's findings shall be valid for a minimum period. Practical implications The funding of research on the COVID-19 is highly essential to accelerate innovative research and help countries fight against the global pandemic. The study's findings reflect the efforts made by nations and institutions to remove the financial and accessibility hurdles. It not only underscores the lead of the USA in the research on COVID-19, but also shows China as a forerunner in sponsoring the research, thus, helping to know the contribution of nations toward understanding the dynamics of pandemic and controlling it. The study will help healthcare practitioners and policymakers recognize the areas that remain the focus of sponsored research on COVID-19 and other left-out areas that need to be taken up and thus may help in policy formulation. It further highlights the impact of prolific funding agencies so that efforts may be initiated to increase the impact and thereby the returns of investment. The study can help to map the scientific structure of COVID-19 through the lens of funded research and recognize core inclinations of its development. Overall, a comprehensive analysis has been performed to present the detailed characteristics of sponsored research on emerging area of COVID-19, and it is informative, useful and one of its kind on the theme.

This study explored how registrars responded to the challenges facing clinical training during the first wave of COVID-19, and how the impact of these disruptions prompted personal and professional development. Registrars completed an online qualitative SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of their training experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Themes related to challenges included mental distress, resource constraints, and compromised and inadequate training. Themes related to strengths and opportunities included new learning experiences, resilience, coping strategies, and enhanced graduate competencies related to leadership, collaboration, communication, and health advocacy. The disruptive and disorienting elements of COVID-19, although situated in chaos, aggravating the constraints of training in under-resourced settings, also provided unexpected learning opportunities.

Governments and civil society have responded swiftly to the virus with policies that reduce human interaction and slow its spread. These policies have had the adverse effect of further reducing labour participation, productivity and capital utilization, reducing household consumption and increasing poverty across various thresholds, both in absolute and relative terms (Dabalen and Paci, 2020;International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2020b;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2020a;Roberton et al., 2020;Verity et al., 2020;World Trade Organization [WTO], 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has signi?cantly reduced economic growth and altered patterns of international economic interaction. While we are still in the midst of the crisis, there is real concern that the majority of macroeconomic effects will not be temporary, but will disproportionately shift long-term development pathways in low- and middle-income countries, offsetting some of the gains made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in recent decades. <br><br>In this report, we study the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 at the country level in Africa through a macroeconomic lens. Speci?cally, we analyse how todays effects on country-level mortality, gross domestic product (GDP) growth and international monetary ?ows of trade, aid, foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittances will shape long-term patterns of mortality, economic growth and international trade by 2030 and 2050. In addition, we unravel how these macroeconomic changes will affect socio-economic indicators and human development by quantifying the outcomes for child mortality and poverty over the coming decades. <br><br>This report presents a conceptual framework (see Figure 1) that conceptualizes the effects of COVID-19 on human development as cascading across three systems. First, COVID-19 directly effects human health systems, changing patterns of mortality and morbidity with differential distribution across countries. Second, these direct health effects are mitigated through government policy and civil society actions that reduce human interaction, slowing the spread of the virus and saving lives while also reducing economic activity and changing patterns of production and consumption. Finally, these changing economic effects ripple through the international economic system, changing patterns of trade, FDI, foreign aid and remittances.

Over 70% of vaccine-eligible Americans are at least partially vaccinated, but there are pockets of the population that are under-vaccinated, such as in rural areas and some demographic groups (e.g. age, race, ethnicity). These unvaccinated pockets are extremely susceptible to the Delta variant, exacerbating the healthcare crisis and increasing the risk of new variants. In this paper, we describe a data-driven model that provides real-time support to Virginia public health officials by recommending mobile vaccination site placement in order to target under-vaccinated populations. Our strategy uses fine-grained mobility data, along with US Census and vaccination uptake data, to identify locations that are most likely to be visited by unvaccinated individuals. We further extend our model to choose locations that maximize vaccine uptake among hesitant groups. We show that the top recommended sites vary substantially across some demographics, demonstrating the value of developing customized recommendation models that integrate fine-grained, heterogeneous data sources. In addition, we used a statistically equivalent Synthetic Population to study the effect of combined demographics (eg, people of a particular race and age), which is not possible using US Census data alone. We validate our recommendations by analyzing the success rates of deployed vaccine sites, and show that sites placed closer to our recommended areas administered higher numbers of doses.

Small intestinal bacterial contamination and tropical enteropathy could trigger inflammatory stimuli and activate the endothelium in the portal venous system. Groundwater contaminated with arsenic is an environmental factor of epidemic proportions in large areas of India which has similar consequences. Von Willebrand factor (a sticky protein) expressed by activated endothelium may promote formation of platelet microthrombi and occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein branches leading to NCIPH. Environmental factors linked to suboptimal hygiene and sanitation, which enter through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, predispose to platelet plugging onto activated endothelium in portal microcirculation. Thus, NCIPH, an example of poverty linked thrombophilia, is a disease mainly affecting the lower socio-economic strata of Indian population. Public health measures to improve sanitation, provide clean drinking water and eliminate arsenic contamination of drinking water are urgently needed. Till such time as these environmental factors are addressed, NCIPH is likely to remain 'an Indian disease'.","output":"What makes non-cirrhotic portal hypertension a common disease in India?

Women are an important population because of negative sequalae and adverse maternal outcomes including congenital syphilis. We assessed whether racial and ethnic disparities in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among heterosexually active women differ by region and age group. METHODS: We synthesized 4 national surveys to estimate numbers of heterosexually active women in the United States from 2014 to 2018 by region, race and ethnicity, and age group (18C24, 25C29, 30C44, and 45 years). We calculated annual P&S syphilis diagnosis rates, assessing disparities with rate differences and rate ratios comparing White, Hispanic, and Black heterosexually active women. RESULTS: Nationally, annual rates were 6.42 and 2.20 times as high among Black and Hispanic than among White heterosexually active women (10.99, 3.77, and 1.71 per 100,000, respectively). Younger women experienced a disproportionate burden of P&S syphilis and the highest disparities. Regionally, the Northeast had the highest Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities using a relative disparity measure (relative rate), and the West had the highest disparities using an absolute disparity measure (rate difference). CONCLUSIONS: To meet the racial and ethnic disparity goals of the Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan, tailored local interventions that address the social and structural factors associated with disparities are needed for different age groups.","output":"Variation in Patterns of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Primary and Secondary Syphilis Diagnosis Rates Among Heterosexually Active Women by Region and Age Group in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the 21st century, while some people seek to use artificial intelligence for health services delivery, others have to surrender their health rights to meet basic needs. The gradient in health has become more pronounced in the COVID-19 crisis considering discrepancies in disease prevalence, geographical accessibility, availability, affordability, quality/safety of health services, and human resources. Through PubMed, GoogleScholar, Scopus, WHO, OECD, and UN databases, the English documents and global statistics were collected. Determining the role of health equity-related factors and introducing mechanisms to maintain regional and international justice in health, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, were among the core concepts of this paper. Social determinants of health (SDH), interregional and intraregional bodies are the main drivers of discrimination in health services. Governments should relish chief health strategists role in possessing legitimacy, accountability, direction, transparent performance, fairness, and good governance in one word. Improving health literacy and telemedicine, providing income support, and reforming insurance where needed, are other national mechanisms to amend inequity. Among interregional issues, what is concerning is the matter of sanctions on access to health services, which is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Shortage of vital medications, ventilators, test kits, COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical raw materials, foreign currency, decreased national currency value, purchasing power parity, and quality/safety of health services resulted from such oppression.

In detail, the correlation coefficient between US and experiments does not differ from FPL and is slightly smaller than LIE. The root mean square error of US simulations is smaller than that of LIE. Moreover, US is better than FPL and poorer than LIE in classifying SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors owing to the reciever operating characteristicCarea under the curve analysis. Furthermore, the US simulations also provide detailed insights on unbinding pathways of ligands from the binding cleft of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

We aim at developing an automatic algorithm that can detect symmetry in skin lesions, as well as indicating the axes of symmetry. We tackle this task based on skin lesions shape, based on their color and texture, and based on their combination. To do so, we consider symmetry axes through the center of mass, random forests classifiers to aggregate across different orientations, and a purposely-built dataset to compare textures that are specific of dermoscopic imagery. We obtain 84C88% accuracy in comparison with samples manually labeled as having either 1-axis symmetry, 2-axes symmetry or as being asymmetric. Besides its diagnostic value, the symmetry of a lesion also explains the reasons that might support such diagnosis.

Clinical evaluation of nasal swab samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19) patients showed that the assay could detect over 23.7 copies within 15 min with a 100% probability. Since the RT-LAMP assay can be performed with a portable battery-supported device, it is a rapid, simple, and sensitive diagnostic assay for COVID-19 that can be available at point-of-care. We also developed the RT-LAMP assay without the RNA extraction step-Direct RT-LAMP, which could detect more than 1.43 x 103 copies within 15 min with a 100% probability in clinical evaluation test.

At 7-9 days post-tumor inoculation, the tumor grew to 5-10 mm, and ~50-75% tumor volume was treated by ultrasound-guided histotripsy, by delivering 1-2 cycle histotripsy pulses at 100 Hz PRF (focal peak negative pressure P- >30 MPa), using a custom 1 MHz transducer. Complete local tumor regression was observed on MRI in 9/11 histotripsy-treated rats, with no local recurrence or metastasis up to the 12-week study end point, and only a <1 mm residual scar tissue observed on histology. In comparison, 100% of untreated control animals demonstrated local tumor progression, developed intrahepatic metastases, and were euthanized at 1-3 weeks.

OBJECTIVE: Establish and sustain a Veteran engagement board involving older Veterans and caregivers to provide input on aging-related research and clinical demonstration projects. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: The Older Veteran Engagement Team (OVET)a group of eight Veterans and one caregiver who range in age from 62 to 92was formed in November 2017 and has met monthly since January 2018. The OVET provides feedback on topics that reflect the foci of the VA Eastern Colorado Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) (e.g., physical functioning, hearing health, and emotional wellness/mental health). Ongoing evaluation documents the return on investment of Veteran engagement. MAIN MEASURES: The OVET member and provider/investigator meeting evaluations with longitudinal follow-up at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Return on investment of Veteran engagement is multi-faceted. For OVET, ROI ranges from grant support to improved healthcare quality/efficiency to social-emotional benefits. To date, funding awards total over $2.3 M for NIH and VA-funded projects to which OVET provided substantive feedback. Documented impacts on healthcare services include reductions in patient wait times, more appropriate utilization of services and increased patient satisfaction. Social-emotional benefits include generativity, as OVET members contribute to improving clinical and community-based supports for other Veterans. The OVET provides an opportunity for older Veterans to share their lived experience with trainees and early career investigators who are preparing for careers serving Veterans. CONCLUSION: The OVET is similar to other established stakeholder engagement groups; team members offer their individual viewpoints at any stage of research, clinical demonstration, or quality improvement projects. The OVET provides a mechanism for the voice of older Veterans and caregivers to shape aspects of individual projects.

Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and UF. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and plasma samples from children with UF and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in NP and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus MLB-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive PCR assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average NP and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with UF. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever. Ultimately these studies may improve the medical treatment of children with UF by helping avoid antibiotic therapy for children with viral infections.","output":"Sequence analysis of the human virome in febrile and afebrile children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To determine if tuberculosis (TB) screening improves patient outcomes, we conducted two systematic reviews to investigate the effect of TB screening on diagnosis, treatment outcomes, deaths (clinical review assessing 23 outcome indicators); and patient costs (economic review).

We divided patients into four groups: (1) NPs and Cs both negative (C?NF?), (2) NPs positive and Cs negative (NFs+Cs?), (3) NPs negative and Cs positive (NFs?Cs+), and (4) NPs and Cs both positive (NFs?Cs+). The secondary outcomes were to correlate Cs results with systemic clinical parameters such as: oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), dyspnea degree (DP), radiologic pulmonary impairment based on chest radiography (XR) or computed tomography (CT), blood chemistry as D-Dimer (D-Dimer), fibrinogen, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (C-RP). RESULTS: A total of 100 conjunctival swabs in 50 patients with SARS-CoV-2 have been enrolled in this interventional clinical trials. Ocular signs (conjunctivitis) were present in five patients (10%).

We aimed to measure the amount of waste generated during endoscopic procedures and to understand the impact on waste of changing from reusable to single use endoscopes in the USA. DESIGN We conducted a 5-day audit (cross-sectional study) of all endoscopies performed at two US academic medical centres with low and a high endoscopy volume (2000 and 13 000 procedures annually, respectively). We calculated the average disposable waste (excluding waste from reprocessing) generated during one endoscopic procedure to estimate waste of all endoscopic procedures generated in the USA annually (18 million). We further estimated the impact of changing from reusable to single-use endoscopes taking reprocessing waste into account. RESULTS 278 endoscopies were performed for 243 patients. Each endoscopy generated 2.1 kg of disposable waste (46 L volume). 64% of waste was going to the landfill, 28% represented biohazard waste and 9% was recycled. The estimated total waste generated during all endoscopic procedures performed in the USA annually would weigh 38 000 metric tons (equivalent of 25 000 passenger cars) and cover 117 soccer fields to 1 m depth. If all endoscopic procedures were performed with single-use endoscopes and accounting for reprocessing, the net waste mass would increase by 40%. Excluding waste from ancillary supplies, net waste generated from reprocessing and endoscope disposal would quadruple with only using single-use endoscopes.

Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and Membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses.IMPORTANCEWidespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines.

Studies also investigated the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coexisting with H. pylori in causing HCC. A causal relationship was never confirmed, and the relationship remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the research on this topic and investigate if a relationship exists between H. pylori infection and the development of HCC and if the presence of HCV and HBV along with H. pylori plays a role in liver carcinogenesis. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review of all relevant studies published in the literature using the keywords \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" and \\"hepatocellular carcinoma\\" on major literature databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane controlled trials register. A total of 656 research studies were identified between 1994 and 2020. Of those, 26 qualified under our selection criteria. Patients who were positive for HCC were classified as cases and those who did not have HCC were classified as controls. The H. pylori status and HCV status, if available, were identified for both groups. Statistical analysis was carried out by a biostatistician according to the Cochrane reviewer's handbook. Results Out of the 26 studies included in the final analysis, 13 were retrospective case-control studies, 11 were cross-sectional studies, and two were prospective case-control and cohort studies. Overall, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 64.78% (561 of 866) amongst HCC cases and 47.92% (1,718 of 3,585) in the non-HCC control group. The summary odds ratio (OR) for the association of H. pylori infection with the risk for HCC (using the random-effects model, which accounted for the heterogeneity across the 26 studies) was determined to be 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.06 - 7.37, I2 = 63%). We also performed a subgroup analysis to determine the odds of developing HCC in the presence of H. pylori and HCV coinfection. The summary OR of it was 12.76 (95% CI: 4.13 - 39.41, I2 = 78%). The summary OR for the risk of developing HCC in the presence of HCV infection without H. pylori infection was 2.21 (95% CI: 0.70 - 6.94, I2 = 79%). Whereas, the odds of developing HCC in the presence of only H. pylori infection without HCV was found to be 0.54 (95% CI: 0.11 - 2.63, I2 = 80%). There was inconsistency in the data presented in some studies regarding HCV infection status. Since data were extracted from different study designs, subgroup analysis by study design was performed which showed no significant difference between the study groups (P = 0.5705). Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates a positive association between H. pylori infection and the development of HCC. There is a significantly higher risk of developing HCC in the presence of HCV infection along with H. pylori.

This study aims to investigate changes in supplement use during pandemic on Turkish people living in Asia, America, Europe and Turkey. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among total 1678 individuals (women, n = 1329 and men, n = 369, Asia n = 139, America n = 507, Europe n = 292 and Turkey n = 760) older than 18 years in January 2021. An online questionnaire was taken by the volunteered participants. In this study, individuals were asked about dietary supplement use before and after the pandemic, which dietary supplements they used in the pandemic process, and why they were used. RESULTS: Individual's dietary supplement use before and during the pandemic were Asia (29.5% and 71.9%), America (40.6% and 75.7%), Europe (30.8% and 68.7%), and Turkey (21.3% and 62.2%) respectively. Vitamin C (74.7%), Vitamin D (58.2%) and multi vitamins (34.2%), Zinc (19.7%), Fish oil (17.9%), Probiotics (13.4%), and Propolis (11.1%) are the most commonly used dietary supplements in all regions. Individuals stated that improving the immune system was the main reason to use dietary supplements (53%). Individuals use it as a result of the diagnosis of nutritional deficiency (14%). The maximum use of dietary supplements in all regions is in between the ages of 31C50. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that dietary supplement use increased during the pandemic in all regions. Although most of the individuals stated that they took supplements to strengthen the immune system, it is known that supplements do not prevent Covid-19. However, it has been stated that the use of vitamin D, C, Zinc and selenium supplements may be beneficial, especially in those with diagnosed nutritional deficiencies and those with upper respiratory tract infections.

Most research on this important topic, however, focused on how patients view the relationship and not how the physicians see it. This research strives to bridge this gap, with the resolution of leading to an improved appreciation of this multifaceted relationship. METHODS: A survey of 328 actively practicing physicians from all four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in Israel resulted in a hierarchical formation of components, indicating both the relative as well as absolute importance of each component in the formation of the patient-physician relationship. The sample conducted was a convenience one. Methodologically, we used two different complementary methods of analysis, with the primary emphasis on the Analytic Hierarchical Processing (AHP), a unique and advanced statistical method. RESULTS: The results provide a detailed picture of physicians' attitudes toward the patient-physician relationship. Research indicates that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. To date, this attitude was mostly referred to intuitively, without the required rigorous investigation provided by this paper. Specifically, the results indicate that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. Namely, while fairness, reliability, devotion, and serviceability received high scores from physicians, social interaction, friendship, familial, as well as appreciation received the lowest scores, indicating low priority for warmth and sociability in the trust relationship from the physician's perspective. The results showed good consistency between the AHP results and the ANOVA comparable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients who traditionally stress the importance of interpersonal skills, physicians stress the significance of the technical expertise and knowledge of health providers, emphasizing the role of competence and performance. Physicians evaluate the relationship on the basis of their ability to solve problems through devotion, serviceability, reliability, and trustworthiness and disregard the \\"softer\\" interpersonal aspects such as caring, appreciation, and empathy that have been found to be important to their patients. This illustrates a mismatch in the important components of relationship building that can lead to a loss of trust, satisfaction, and repeat purchase. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: We study the impact physicians' incentives have on the tangible relationship and discuss the significance of physician-patient relationship on satisfaction with the health service given. As a result policies leading to a more dynamic role must be given to the patient, who being well informed by the physician, can help in the decision making process. Policy schemes need to be implemented as a way of changing physicians' behavior, forcing them to better construct and utilize this dyadic relationship.","output":"The patient-physician relationship: an account of the physician's perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196/21366.].","output":"Correction: Work-Related and Personal Factors Associated With Mental Well-Being During the COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Nosocomial infection is an ongoing concern in the COVID-19 outbreak The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system","output":"The costs of an expanded screening criteria for COVID-19: a modelling study.

This study investigated how college students' perceptions of COVID-19 interplayed with self-efficacy on their academic plans and further identified major differences between students in service-oriented and nonservice-oriented majors. Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered online survey was conducted with 299 undergraduates at a large Midwestern university during COVID-19. Regression analyses, including conditional analyses, examined the study hypotheses using SPSS. Findings - The results showed that, in general, students' self-efficacy reduced their intentions to change their academic majors. The joint effects of self-efficacy and perception of COVID-19 diverged among students in nonservice-oriented majors but converged among students in service-oriented majors (e.g. hospitality and tourism). These students in the service fields showed more commitment to their current majors even as their concerns about the social implications of COVID-19 increased.

With the vaccination programme and reducing infection levels, attention is turning to addressing these waiting lists. One procedure that was affected was the removal of implantable loop recorders (ILRs). Manufacturers recommend that ILRs are removed at the point of battery depletion (usually 3-4 years), if they have not already been removed due to a positive finding or patient preference. There is little evidence in the literature regarding late complications with ILRs, and we therefore wished to examine what patients' thoughts would be about keeping the ILR in for a longer period of time. Methods Patients awaiting ILR explantation and those who had undergone explantation, were identified. A retrospective review of the notes was used to get demographic and clinical data. Both groups of patients were contacted, and a questionnaire used to gain an understanding of patients' experience and expectations. Results Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, 60 patients who had undergone ILR explantation were identified. A total of 22 responded to our questionnaire (table 1). The majority (86%) were happy to have their ILR removed, although a smaller majority (59%) would also have been happy to have had the device kept in, were it felt to be safe. Very few patients felt a tangible difference as a result of having the ILR removed (14%) and no patients were worried about the waiting time prior to Covid-19. Of 77 patients currently awaiting explant, 30 responded to our questionnaire (table 1), with 70% not being concerned by the wait for removal. This is likely aided by the fact that 80% of patients had no day to day symptoms as a result of the ILR. Half of the patients however, would be concerned about not having the ILR removed, predominantly due to mild discomfort or concerns regarding the presence of a battery. Across both groups (n=52) only 8 patients were concerned about the risk of coming into the hospital for the procedure, with patients commenting that the stringent regulations that hospitals had employed combined with the vaccination programme, gave them significant confidence in attending for outpatient procedures. Conclusions This study found that if patients are reassured about the safety of keeping an implantable loop recorder in, and do not suffer any discomfort or symptoms as a result of the device, they are happy both to wait longer for device removal, or even not have it removed at all. In the context of the current pandemic, more thought should perhaps be given to patient guided removal times, especially in cases of removals performed for battery depletion.","output":"Reworking the post-covid waiting list-the patient experience of implantable loop recorder explantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 virus may be inflicting detriments to the cardiovascular system, both directly through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor as well as initiating systemic inflammation. In particular, recent evidence has suggested a decrease in vascular function in the arms and legs which may persist for some time following recovery from SARS-CoV-2. Methods We have assessed vascular function in 7 young healthy adults (4M/3F, 201y, 17412cm, 728kg) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using Doppler ultrasound, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the arm and single passive limb movement (sPLM) in the leg were assessed as markers of vascular function at baseline (3-4 weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2) and at 1-month and 2-month follow up testing visits. Data are meanSD. Results The sum of shear at peak brachial artery vasodilation decreased from baseline (81,36935,101AU) to the 2-month follow up visit (50,58436,606AU) (p&lt;0.05).

Given the severity and the wide and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is very likely that the virus recognizes other receptors/co-receptors besides the ACE2. The NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 contains a receptor-binding motif different from that of SARS-CoV, with some insertions that could confer to the new coronavirus new receptor binding abilities. In particular, motifs similar to the insertion 72GTNGTKR78 have been found in structural proteins of other viruses; and these motifs were located in putative regions involved in recognizing protein and sugar receptors, suggesting therefore that similar binding abilities could be displayed by the SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTD.

The genome of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has recently been sequenced, and a number of genes identified, including that of the nucleocapsid protein (N). It is noted, however, that the N protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with nucleocapsid proteins of other members of the coronavirus family [Science 300 (2003) 1399; Science 300 (2003) 1394]. N proteins of other coronavirus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral RNA. As data generated from some viral systems other than coronaviruses suggested that viral NCN self-interactions may be necessary for subsequent formation of the nucleocapsid and assembly of the viral particles, we decided to investigate SARS-CoV NCN interaction. By using mammalian two-hybrid system and sucrose gradient fractionations, a homotypic interaction of N, but not M, was detected by the two-hybrid analysis. The mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed an approximately 50-fold increase in SEAP activity (measurement of proteinCprotein interaction) in NCN interaction compared to that observed in either MCM or mock transfection. Furthermore, mutational analyses characterized that a serine/arginine-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization, since deletion of this region completely abolished the N protein self-multimerization. Finally, the full-length nucleocapsid protein expressed and purified from baculovirus system was found to form different levels of higher order structures as detected by Western blot analysis of the fractionated proteins.

This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgustCpurity viceCprotection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgustCcognitive processesCpreventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels. Furthermore, our research provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis of pathogen prevalence.","output":"Exploring the Mechanisms of Influence on COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors in Chinas Social Media Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants. METHODS: We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. RESULTS: The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI = 10.3C15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.","output":"Changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement due to COVID-19 and depressive symptomatology: A cross-sectional a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied widely in our daily lives in a variety of ways with numerous success stories.

However, the timing of the magmatism in the Okinawa Trough (OT) is not well constrained by the age spectra of zircons. Here, for the first time, we carry out an integrated study combining in situ analysis of zircon U-Th-Pb and Hf-O isotopes, and trace element compositions of zircons from the volcanic rocks from the southernmost part of the OT. We found that the young (< 100 ka) zircons in these volcanic rocks have old (108 Ma to 2.7 Ga) inherited cores, which were captured as the magma ascended through the rifting continental crust. In particular, the inherited Archean zircons strongly suggest that remnants of the old East Asian continental blocks underlie the embryonic crustal rifting zone. Moreover, the ages of most of the inherited zircons correspond to five supercontinent amalgamation events. Specifically, the Archaean inherited zircons, which have positive Hf(t) and low 18O values, correspond to the formation of juvenile continental crust. In contrast, the negative Hf(t) and high 18O values of the post-Archaean inherited zircons indicate that their parental magma contained recycled older crust due to the enhanced crust-mantle interactions during the evolution of the early continental crust. Therefore, the inherited zircons in the back-arc volcanic rocks not only reflect the evolution of the local magmatism, but they also contain a record of the Archaean crustal fragment and of several global continental amalgamation events.","output":"Zircon record of an Archaean crustal fragment and supercontinent amalgamation in quaternary back-arc volcanic rocks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: Los primeros informes de China sugirieron que la coinfeccin con otros patgenos en la COVID-19 era anmala, las ltimas evidencias han demostrado que pueden aparecer otras infecciones, sobre todo en pacientes graves.

The proposed sensitivity is not higher than 60%, but its high specificity allows both quick decisions for the management of patients and confirmation by molecular diagnosis for only negative tests. However, from the first tests performed, we suspected that the sensitivity observed with routine use was much lower than that announced by the manufacturer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of one month, we compared the negative results obtained with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip kit with those obtained from qRT-PCR performed in a laboratory qualified for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. All samples tested were naso-pharyngeal smears from UTM-RT medium. RESULTS: Of 774 patients tested, 714 negative samples were sent for confirmation, and 159 were found to be positive by qRT-PCR. The median positive percentage agreement was 23.9% (95% CI: 14.2%-38.2%). The Cohens kappa score was 0.35. CONCLUSION: Using this immunochromatographic assay as a triage test did not significantly reduce the number of samples outsourced for COVID-19 confirmation by qRT-PCR. In addition, even if the turn-around time is short, the assay is completely manual, which is not suitable for large volumes of routine samples.

Elevated percentage IPF at presentation was predictive of length of hospitalization (P < 001) and ICU admission (P < 005). Additionally, percentage IPF at the peak was significantly higher among ICU patients than non-ICU patients (69  51 vs 53  84, P < 001) and among deceased patients than recovered patients (79  63 vs 54  78, P < 001).

Camels are the likely animal source for zoonotic infection, although exact transmission modes remain to be determined. Human-to-human transmission occurs sporadically. The wide geographic distribution of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels and ongoing transmissions to humans provides concern for the evolution of a MERS-CoV variant with efficient human-to-human transmission capabilities. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has occurred by analysis of full-length genomes or multiple concatenated genome fragments, which is time-consuming, costly and limited to high viral load samples. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple, reliable MERS-CoV variant typing assay to facilitate monitoring of MERS-CoV diversity in animals and humans. STUDY DESIGN: Phylogenetic analysis of presently known full-length MERS-CoV genomes was performed to identify genomic regions with sufficient phylogenetic content to allow reliable MERS-CoV variant typing. RT-PCR assays targeting these regions were designed and optimized. RESULTS: A reverse-transcription PCR assay for MERS-CoV targeting a 615 bp spike fragment provides a phylogenetic clustering of MERS-CoV variants comparable to that of full-length genomes. The detection limit corresponds to a cycle treshold value of 35 with standard upE real time PCR assays on RNA isolated from MERS-CoV EMC. Nasal swabs from RT-PCR positive camels (Ct values 12.9C32.2) yielded reliable sequence information in 14 samples.

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines, which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain-Barr syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases.

Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.

METHODS: All cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction of a nasopharyngeal specimen. Contact tracing is undertaken for all confirmed cases in order to identify close contacts that will be systematically screened and quarantined. Transmission chains were identified based on field investigation, contact tracing, results of screening tests and by assessing all probable mode of transmission and interactions. RESULTS: As of May 18, 2020, 656 cases out of a total of 1043 confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 belong to 127 transmission chains identified during the epidemic (mean age 42.36 years, Standard deviation 19.56 and sex ratio 0.86). The virus transmission is the most concentrated in the governorate of Tunis (31.5%), Ariana (10.2%) and Ben Arous (10.2%). Virus transmission occurred 50 times (9.72% of secondary transmission events) between two different governorates. A maximum of seven generations of secondary infection was identified, whereas 62% of these secondary infections belong the first generation. A total of 11 \\"super spreader\\" cases were identified in this investigation. Four large clusters have been identified. The evolution of secondary cases highlighted two peaks: one in 2nd April and a second in 16 th April whereas imported cases caused local transmission of virus during the early phase of the epidemic.

Continuation of psychiatric services for individuals with high clinical acuity was critical. This study examined attendance to rapidly deployed telehealth services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals receiving intensive outpatient program (IOP), primarily group-based psychotherapy services for adults and adolescents by race/ethnicity, insurance, and clinical treatment program within a large hospital-based outpatient psychiatric setting. Methods: Chi-square tests compared whether attendance rates for telehealth versus in-person IOP services varied by population group, race, insurance, and clinical program, using observational data of adolescent and adult patients treated between October 1, 2019, and July 31, 2020. Results: Appointment attendance increased for telehealth versus in-person services for adolescents (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 27.49, p < 0.0001) and adults (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 434.37, p < 0.0001). For adults, increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed across insurance type (Medicaid: +11.5%; Medicare: +13.79%; Commercial: +6.94%), race/ethnicity (+6.23% to +15.76% across groups), and for IOP groups across all five diagnostic treatment programs (between 7.59% and 15.9% increases across groups). Adolescent results were mixed; increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed among commercially insured youth (+7.11%), but no differences were observed for Medicaid-insured youth. Non-Hispanic white youth had increased attendance for telehealth (+8.38%) and no differences were observed for non-Hispanic black youth. Decreases were found in telehealth attendance for Hispanic/Latinx youth (-13.49%). Discussion: Rapidly deployed telehealth increased attendance to intensive services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals, particularly among adults and for adolescents with commercial insurance and non-Hispanic white youth. Trends among racial/ethnic and Medicaid-insured youth warrant further investigation regarding the potential for special challenges or vulnerabilities and advocacy needs. Findings highlight telehealth as an important tool in supporting availability of services for individuals with high levels of psychiatric acuity, particularly for group-based services, during the pandemic.","output":"Showing Up Is Half the Battle: The Impact of Telehealth on Psychiatric Appointment Attendance for Hospital-Based Intensive Outpatient Services During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have redefined state-of-the-art in many real-world applications, such as facial recognition, image classification, human pose estimation, and semantic segmentation. Despite their success, CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight changes to their inputs may lead to sharp changes in their output in even well-trained networks. Set-based analysis methods can detect or prove the absence of bounded adversarial attacks, which can then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of neural network training methodology. Unfortunately, existing verification approaches have limited scalability in terms of the size of networks that can be analyzed. In this paper, we describe a set-based framework that successfully deals with real-world CNNs, such as VGG16 and VGG19, that have high accuracy on ImageNet. Our approach is based on a new set representation called the ImageStar, which enables efficient exact and over-approximative analysis of CNNs. ImageStars perform efficient set-based analysis by combining operations on concrete images with linear programming (LP). Our approach is implemented in a tool called NNV, and can verify the robustness of VGG networks with respect to a small set of input states, derived from adversarial attacks, such as the DeepFool attack. The experimental results show that our approach is less conservative and faster than existing zonotope and polytope methods.","output":"Verification of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using ImageStars"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infectious diseases occur in Africa.

Background: Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods: An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions: There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors. Multidisciplinary team discussions should be leveraged to consider patient- and tumour-specific information for each individual case.","output":"Strategies for the delay of surgery in the management of resectable hepatobiliary malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract.","output":"More on the source of D-dimer in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After months in denial, on 2nd March 2020 the first case of COVID-19 in Indonesia was announced and soon was declared as a national pandemic COVID-19 was since being the headlines of the news offline and online This trigger either positive or negative responses from the readers, which in turn affect at least the depth of understanding and furthermore the effectiveness of any enforced intervention taken with the purpose to control the transmission of the COVID-19 In order to assess how likely the COVID-19-containing news being forwarded to reach more readers and how the pertinent news bridge further virtual interaction, we crawled data from Twitter as the major online microblogging platform to analyze how likely COVID-19-containing tweets were echoed and what typical tweet about COVID-19 that gained attentions This is critical to evaluate how people virtually responded against the tweets Our analyzed data is visualized using Matplotlib by Python and Graph Prism8 accordingly We figured out that timing and number of followers are not determinative for the tweets being retweeted Instead, provoking headline add likelihood for the tweets to be moving forward Also appeared in our analysis that the top two media (Detik and Kompas) shared the same proportion on their tweet type fractions on where information dominated the fraction of their tweets","output":"Provoking Tweets by Indonesia Media Twitter in the Initial Month of Coronavirus Disease Hit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding real-world dynamical phenomena remains a challenging task. Across various scientific disciplines, machine learning has advanced as the go-to technology to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems, identify patterns in big data, and make decision around them. Neural networks are now consistently used as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms that are incompletely understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural networks alone ignore the fundamental laws of physics and often fail to make plausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties by combining neural networks, physics-informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to improve the predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed the physical model of a damped harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected feed-forward neural network to explore a simple and illustrative model system, the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics-Informed Neural Networks can seamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse problems, and perform well for both interpolation and extrapolation, even for a small amount of noisy and incomplete data. At only minor additional cost, they can self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics. Combined with Bayesian Neural Networks, they can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and provide credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals the inherent advantages and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian Inference, and a combination of both and provides valuable guidelines for model selection. While we have only demonstrated these approaches for the simple model problem of a seasonal endemic infectious disease, we anticipate that the underlying concepts and trends generalize to more complex disease conditions and, more broadly, to a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems.","output":"Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks for real-world nonlinear dynamical systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart rate variability (HRV) is the rate of variability between each heartbeat with respect to time.

This review article presents a summary and analysis of various research works that analyzed HRV associated with morbidity, pain, drowsiness, stress and exercise through signal processing and machine learning methods. The points of emphasis with regards to HRV research as well as the gaps associated with processes which can be improved to enhance the quality of the research have been discussed meticulously. Restricting the physiological signals to Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), and respiration (RESP) analysis resulted in 25 articles which examined the cause and effect of increased/reduced HRV. Reduced HRV was generally associated with increased morbidity and stress. High HRV normally indicated good health, and in some instances, it could signify clinical events of interest such as drowsiness. Effective analysis of HRV during ambulatory and motion situations such as exercise, video gaming, and driving could have a significant impact toward improving social well-being. Detection of HRV in motion is far from perfect, situations involving exercise or driving reported accuracy as high as 85% and as low as 59%.

In this observational prospective study, we evaluated immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in cohorts of primary or secondary immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Five clinical groups of immunocompromised patients [primary immunodeficiency (PID) (n=57), people living with HIV (PLWH) (n=27), secondary immunocompromised patients with a broad variety of underlying rheumatologic (n=23) and homogeneous (multiple sclerosis) neurologic (n=53) conditions and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n=39)] as well as a healthy control group (n=54) were included. Systemic humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies using a TrimericS IgG assay (Diasorin) and through quantification of interferon gamma release in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigen with QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay (Qiagen), respectively. Responses were measured at pre-defined time-points after complete vaccination. RESULTS: All healthy controls, PLWH and CKD-patients had detectable antibodies 10 to 14 days (T2) and 3 months (T3) after administration of the second vaccination. In contrast, only 94.5% of the PID, 50.0% of the rheumatologic and 48.0% of neurologic patients developed antibodies at T2 and only 89.1% of the PID, 52.4% of the rheumatologic and 50.0% of neurologic patients developed antibodies at T3. At T3 no significant differences in cellular response between the healthy control group and the PLWH and CKD groups were found, while proportions of reactive subjects were lower in PID and rheumatologic patients and higher in neurologic patients. Humoral and cellular immune responses significantly correlated in the healthy control, PID, PLWH groups for all 3 antigens. CONCLUSION: Patients with acquired or inherited immune disorders may show variable immune responses to vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS We trained machine learning classifiers to identify categorical outcomes of edema, midline shift (MLS), hemorrhagic transformation, and parenchymal hematoma, as well as rule-based systems (RBS) to identify intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and continuous MLS measurements within CT/MRI reports. Using a derivation cohort of 2289 reports from 550 individuals with acute middle cerebral artery territory ischemic strokes, we externally validated our models on reports from a separate institution as well as from patients with ischemic strokes in any vascular territory. RESULTS In all data sets, a deep neural network with pretrained biomedical word embeddings (BioClinicalBERT) achieved the highest discrimination performance for binary prediction of edema (area under precision recall curve [AUPRC] > 0.94), MLS (AUPRC > 0.98), hemorrhagic conversion (AUPRC > 0.89), and parenchymal hematoma (AUPRC > 0.76).

Fibrin sheath, intimately related with the biofilm, is the precipitating factor of this environment, determining catheter patency and patient morbidity. Its association with bacterial overgrowth and thrombosis has led to the search of multiple preventive measures. Among them is the development of catheter coatings to prevent thrombosis and infections. There are two kinds of treatments to cover the catheter surface: antithrombotic and antimicrobial coatings. In nondialysis-related settings, mainly in intensive care units, both have been shown to be efficient in the prevention of catheter-related infection. This includes heparin, silver, chlorhexidine, rifampicine and minocycline. In hemodialysis population, however, few studies on surface-treated catheters have been made and they do not provide evidence that shows complication reduction. The higher effectiveness of coatings in nontunneled catheters may depend on the short average life of these devices. Hemodialysis catheters need to be used over long periods of time and require clinical trials to show effectiveness of coatings over long periods. This also means greater knowledge of biofilm etiopathogeny and fibrin sheath development.","output":"New technology: heparin and antimicrobial-coated catheters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many research works report a sensitive detection of a wide variety of gas species.

The different gas-sensitive films were characterised via several techniques such as FESEM, TEM, and Raman. First, an extensive study was performed to detect isolated NO2, CO2, and NH3 molecules, unravelling the sensing mechanism at the operating temperatures applied. Besides, the effect of the ambient moisture was also evaluated. Afterwards, a model for target gas identification and concentration prediction was developed. Indeed, the sensor array was used in mixtures of NO2 and CO2 for studying the cross-sensitivity and developing a calibration model. As a result, the NO2 detection with different background levels of CO2 was achieved with an R2 of 0.987 and an RMSE of about 22 ppb.","output":"Metal loaded nano-carbon gas sensor array for pollutant detection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Individual assessment of the amplitude of a physiologic reflex evoked by a standardized noxious test (SNT) before surgical stimulation has been suggested to predict movement upon the forthcoming surgical stimulation. This study aimed to compare the ability of pupillary dilatation reflex amplitude (PDRA) evoked by an SNT and estimated remifentanil effect-site concentration (Ce) to predict movement upon surgical stimulation. METHODS Eighty female patients were anesthetized for vacuum aspiration with propofol (Ce 4 g/ml) and remifentanil. Remifentanil Ce was randomized to 0, 1, 3, or 5 ng/ml. SNT was a 60-mA, 5-s, 100-Hz tetanus applied on median nerve before cervix dilatation. PDRA was calculated as the difference in pupillary diameter after and before SNT. Movement upon cervix dilatation was recorded by an independent observer. Ability of PDRA and estimated remifentanil Ce to discriminate movers from non-movers during cervix dilatation was measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. RESULTS Twenty-one of the 76 patients analyzed moved during cervix dilatation. Mean PDRA (1 SD) evoked by SNT was 2.0  1.2 mm in movers and 0.6  0.7 in non-movers (P < 0.0001). Remifentanil Ce was 0.2  0.4 ng/ml in movers and 3.0  1.7 in non-movers (P < 0.0001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for PDRA was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.96) and for remifentanil Ce 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98), without any significant difference between the two areas. CONCLUSIONS PDRA evoked by an SNT is as accurate as the estimated remifentanil Ce to predict movement upon cervix dilatation. PDRA could be valuable when estimated opioid Ce is not available or reliable.","output":"Prediction of movement to surgical stimulation by the pupillary dilatation reflex amplitude evoked by a standardized noxious test."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health disaster since March 2020 and has had a significant impact on education.

Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they appear effective in non-pregnant patients and even under compassionate use. Method We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for COVID-19. Results Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, since they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. They may thus be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of COVID-19 may differ from conventional use. These include the HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir which have low placental transfer; interferon which does not cross the placental barrier, and (hydroxy) chloroquine, which have high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir and azithromycin, as well as some monoclonals. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy due to known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab and other IL-6 inhibitors, umifenovir and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion In life-threatening cases of COVID-19, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother.

In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus.

The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and advantages of the qigong exercise and acupressure rehabilitation program (QARP) for treating patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: : A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 aged 20 to 80 years were recruited and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive QARP plus standard therapies or standard therapies alone. QARP consisted of acupressure therapy and qigong exercise (Liu Zi Jue). The primary outcome was measured with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, and the secondary outcomes included the modified Borg dyspnea scale (MBS), fatigue Scale-14 (FS-14), patient health questionnaire-9 scale (PHQ-9), duration of respiratory symptoms, and vital signs. RESULTS: : In total, 128 patients completed the treatment. The QARP group and standard therapies group showed significant improvements in vital signs (except blood pressure) and clinical scales compared with baseline (p<0.05). The QARP group also showed more significant improvement in the mMRC dyspnea scale (-1.8 [-2.1, -1.6], p=0.018) and modified Borg dyspnea scale (-3.7 [95% confidence intervals (CI) -4.3, -3.1], p=0.045).

We aimed to investigate the association between baseline sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who had baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans at a Korean university hospital from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The main outcome was time from hospital admission to discharge. Death was considered as a competing risk for discharge. Baseline skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra was measured from chest CT scans. The lowest quartile of skeletal muscle index (skeletal muscle cross-sectional area divided by height-squared) was defined as sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 121 patients (median age, 62 years; 44 men; 29 sarcopenic), 7 patients died and 86 patients were discharged during the 60-day follow-up. Patients with sarcopenia showed a longer time to discharge (median, 55 vs 28 days; p < .001) and a higher incidence of death (17.2% vs 2.2%; p = .004) than those without sarcopenia. Baseline sarcopenia was an independent predictor of delayed hospital discharge (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.23-0.96), but was not independently associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 (aHR, 3.80; 95% CI, 0.48-30.26).

However, due to the variety of lung nodules and the similarity of visual characteristics for nodules and their surroundings, robust segmentation of nodules becomes a challenging problem. A segmentation algorithm based on the fast marching method is proposed that separates the image into regions with similar features, which are then merged by combining regions growing with k-means. An evaluation was performed with two distinct methods (objective and subjective) that were applied on two different datasets, containing simulation data generated for this study and real patient data, respectively. The objective experimental results show that the proposed technique can accurately segment nodules, especially in solid cases, given the mean Dice scores of 0.933 and 0.901 for round and irregular nodules. For non-solid and cavitary nodules the performance dropped0.799 and 0.614 mean Dice scores, respectively. The proposed method was compared to active contour models and to two modern deep learning networks.

These cells were almost completely restricted to the CD4-CD8- IEL population, and unlike peripheral NK cells in the rat, they were CD2-. We now report that rat intraepithelial NK (IENK) and peripheral NK cells are similar in morphology, in their ability to lyse NK-sensitive targets, and in their ability to suppress a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture. In contrast, however, intraepithelial and splenic NK cells differ markedly in two respects. First, IENK cells express high levels of ADP-ribosyltransferase 2 (a marker of regulatory T cells in the rat) and CD25, whereas peripheral NK cells do not. Second, unlike splenic NK cells, a substantial fraction of IENK cells appear to spontaneously secrete IL-4 and/or IFN-gamma. We conclude that the rat IEL compartment harbors a large population of NKR-P1A+CD3- cells that function as NK cells but display an activated phenotype and unusual cytokine profile that clearly distinguish them from splenic NK cells. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics suggest that these distinctive IENK cells may participate in the regulation of mucosal immunity.","output":"An atypical population of NK cells that spontaneously secrete IFN-gamma and IL-4 is present in the intraepithelial lymphoid compartment of the rat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given the unceasing worldwide surge in COVID-19 cases, there is an imperative need to develop highly specific and sensitive serology assays to define exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Pooled plasma samples from PCR positive COVID-19 patients were used to identify linear B-cell epitopes from a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins by peptide-based ELISA. Hit epitopes were further validated with 79 COVID-19 patients with different disease severity status, 13 seasonal human CoV, 20 recovered SARS patients and 22 healthy donors. FINDINGS: Four immunodominant epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, were identified on the S and N viral proteins. IgG responses to all identified epitopes displayed a strong detection profile, with N4P5 achieving the highest level of specificity (100%) and sensitivity (>96%) against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the magnitude of IgG responses to S14P5, S21P2 and N4P5 were strongly associated with disease severity. INTERPRETATION: IgG responses to the peptide epitopes can serve as useful indicators for the degree of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients, and function as higly specific and sensitive sero-immunosurveillance tools for recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. The flexibility of these epitopes to be used alone or in combination will allow for the development of improved point-of-care-tests (POCTs).

Later, the authors of this viewpoint discussed their ideas and established the reflections presented here, many of them based on their experiences and the Brazilian context. Finally, the final considerations were established. Results: The main reflections are directed in the sense that most Brazilian companies have felt harshly the consequences of the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic of Covid-19 and, in some way, they need to rethink some of their administrative practices. In this scenario of profound organizational changes, we believe that the management standards of the International Organization for Standardization can be characterized as an important knowledge base, since they present information of high credibility, widely debated by experts and that are easily accessible to Brazilian managers in different themes. Limitations of the investigation: Since it is a viewpoint, part of the information presented here are the perceptions and considerations of the authors.

Studies have reported acceptable outcomes after contaminated ventral hernia repair, but whether stoma closure and incisional hernia repair should be performed as a combined procedure is unknown. This study examined combined stoma closure and incisional hernia repair compared with incisional hernia repair only. METHODS: This was a nationwide propensity-score matched study. Patients who underwent elective incisional hernia repair from 2007C2017 were identified in the Danish Hernia Database. All patients who underwent concurrent stoma closure were matched 1:3 with patients who underwent incisional hernia repair only. The primary outcome was reoperation for hernia recurrence, whereas secondary outcomes included anastomotic leakage, length of hospital stay, and 30-day reoperation and readmission rates. RESULTS: In total, 516 patients were included. The risk of reoperation for recurrence was increased after concurrent stoma closure compared with incisional hernia repair only (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.01C2.82, p = 0.044). Seven (5.4%) patients who underwent incisional hernia repair concurrent to stoma closure were reoperated for anastomotic leakage. Length of hospital stay and reoperation rates within 30 days were increased after concurrent stoma closure compared with incisional hernia repair only (median 8 versus 3 days, p < 0.001 and 29.5% versus 18.6%, p = 0.013), whereas there was no difference in 30-day readmission rates (p = 0.251).

Methods: . Pharmacometric parameter estimates used in this study were obtained from the U.S. FDA website from a new drug application for fluoxetine hydrochloride. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses (20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, and 60 mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough plasma level for the EC50 and EC90 SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. All analyses and graphing were conducted in the R. Results: . By day-10 at 20 mg/day 93.2% and 47% of the population will achieve the trough target plasma EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectively, which translates to a lung tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher EC50 (283.6 ng/ml [0.82 mM]) and EC90 (1390.1 ng/ml [4.02 mM]).

However, the micro-scale fabric evolution and instability mechanism of macroscopic strength behavior of such UPAB materials still remain unclear. In this study, virtual monotonic triaxial compression tests were conducted by using the discrete element method (DEM) modeling approach on specimens with different gradations quantified by the parameter of gravel-to-sand ratio (G/S). The realistic aggregate particle shape and inter-particle contact behavior were properly considered in the DEM model. The micromechanical mechanisms of the shearing failure of such UPAB materials and their evolution characteristics with G/S values were disclosed from contact force chains, microstructures, and particle motion. It was found that the proportion of rotating particles in the specimens decreased and the proportion of relative sliding between particles increased as the content of fine particles decreased. The plastic yielding of the specimens originated from the failure of contact force chains and the occurrence of the relative motion between particles, while the final instability was manifested by the large-scale relative motion among particles along the failure plane (i.e., changes in the internal particle topology). By comparing the macroscopic strength, microstructure evolution, and particle motion characteristics of the specimens with different G/S values, it was found that the specimens with G/S value of 1.8 performed the best, and that the G/S value of 1.8 could be regarded as the threshold for separating floating dense and skeletal gap type packing structures. The variation of Euler angles of rotating particles was significantly reduced in the particle size range of 4.75 mm to 9.50 mm, indicating that this size range separates most of the particles from rolling and sliding. Since particle rolling and sliding behavior are directly related to shear strength, this validates the rationality of the parameter G/S for controlling and optimizing gradations from the perspective of particle movement. The findings could provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for the effective design and efficient utilization of UPAB materials.","output":"Discrete Element Modeling of Instability Mechanisms of Unbound Permeable Aggregate Base Materials in Triaxial Compression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Up to date, there were no approved drugs against coronavirus (COVID-19) disease that dangerously affects global health and the economy.

VITT is caused by anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies activating platelets through their FcRIIa receptors. Antibodies activating platelets through FcRIIa receptors have also been identified in COVID-19 patients. These findings raise concern that vaccination-induced antibodies against anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cause thrombosis by cross-reacting with PF4. Immunogenic epitopes of PF4 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were compared using in-silico prediction tools and 3D-modelling. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and PF4 share at least one similar epitope. Reactivity of purified anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT was tested against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, none of the affinity-purified anti-PF4 antibodies from 14 VITT patients cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Sera from 222 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients from five European centers were tested by PF4/heparin ELISA and PF4-dependent platelet activation assays. We found anti-PF4 antibodies in 19 of 222 (8.6%) COVID-19 patient sera. However, only four showed weak to moderate platelet activation in the presence of PF4, and none of these patients developed thrombotic complications.

Studies were included if they involved recruitment and author affiliation across different country income groupings using World Bank definitions. The direction of data flow was extracted with a data collection tool using sites of trial recruitment as the starting point and the location of authors conducting statistical analysis as the ending point. RESULTS: Of 1993 records initially retrieved, 517 studies underwent abstract screening, 348 studies underwent full-text screening and 305 studies were included. Funders from high-income countries were the sole funders of the majority (82%) of clinical trials that recruited across income groupings. In 224 (73.4%) of all assessable studies, data flowed exclusively to authors affiliated with high-income countries or to a majority of authors affiliated with high-income countries for statistical analysis. Only six (3.2%) studies demonstrated data flow to lower middle-income countries and upper middle-income countries for analysis, with only one with data flow to a lower middle-income country.

This retrospective study included 210 elderly COVID-19 patients (aged  65 years), of whom 175 patients were discharged and 35 died. All deceased patients had at least one comorbidity. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the deceased group had cardiovascular diseases (49% vs. 20%), respiratory diseases (51% vs. 11%), chronic kidney disease (29% vs. 5%) and cerebrovascular disease (20% vs. 3%) than that in the discharged group.

Unlike the paradigmatic enveloped virus fusion proteins, the FAST proteins position the majority of their mass within and internal to the membrane in which they reside, resulting in extended C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (CTs). Using tail truncations, we demonstrate that the last 8 residues of the 36-residue CT of the avian reovirus p10 FAST protein and the last 20 residues of the 68-residue CT of the reptilian reovirus p14 FAST protein enhance, but are not required for, pore expansion and syncytium formation. Further truncations indicate that the membrane-distal 12 residues of the p10 and 47 residues of the p14 CTs are essential for pore formation and that a residual tail of 21 to 24 residues that includes a conserved, membrane-proximal polybasic region present in all FAST proteins is insufficient to maintain FAST protein fusion activity. Unexpectedly, a reextension of the tail-truncated, nonfusogenic p10 and p14 constructs with scrambled versions of the deleted sequences restored pore formation and syncytiogenesis, while reextensions with heterologous sequences partially restored pore formation but failed to rescue syncytiogenesis. The membrane-distal regions of the FAST protein CTs therefore exert multiple effects on the membrane fusion reaction, serving in both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent manners as positive effectors of pore formation, pore expansion, and syncytiogenesis.","output":"Multifaceted sequence-dependent and -independent roles for reovirus FAST protein cytoplasmic tails in fusion pore formation and syncytiogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Working in the ICU during the first COVID-19 wave was associated with high levels of mental health disorders.

Our aim, therefore, was to describe the referral patterns to a high-volume neurosurgical department in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Electronic referrals were identified from the referrals database for the period between 01/01/2020 and 31/05/2020, inclusive, with the month of January used as a baseline. Demographics and referral diagnoses were captured on Excel (Microsoft). Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). Differences between referral volumes were evaluated by chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. Results A total of 2293 electronic referrals were received during the study period. Median age was 63 years. Overall, referrals fell significantly in volume during the study period (2(4)=60.95; p<0.001). Patterns in daily referrals as the pandemic progressed are described. There was a statistically significant reduction in the volume of referrals for degenerative spine cases and traumatic brain injuries (p<0.001).

Several proteases cluster into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), suggesting that TEMs are preferred virus entry portals. Here we found that several CoV receptors and virus-priming proteases were indeed present in TEMs. Isolated TEMs, when mixed with CoV and LP IAV pseudoparticles, cleaved viral fusion proteins to fusion-primed fragments and potentiated viral transductions. That entering viruses utilize TEMs as a protease source was further confirmed using tetraspanin antibodies and tetraspanin short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Tetraspanin antibodies inhibited CoV and LP IAV infections, but their virus-blocking activities were overcome by expressing excess TEM-associated proteases. Similarly, cells with reduced levels of the tetraspanin CD9 resisted CoV pseudoparticle transductions but were made susceptible by overproducing TEM-associated proteases. These findings indicated that antibodies and CD9 depletions interfere with viral proteolytic priming in ways that are overcome by surplus proteases. TEMs appear to be exploited by some CoVs and LP IAVs for appropriate coengagement with cell receptors and proteases. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses use their surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion, an essential cell entry step. Host cell components prime these viral surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion at specific times and places during virus cell entry. Among these priming components are proteases, which cleave viral surface glycoproteins, unleashing them to refold in ways that catalyze virus-cell membrane fusions. For some enveloped viruses, these proteases are known to reside on target cell surfaces. This research focuses on coronavirus and influenza A virus cell entry and identifies TEMs as sites of viral proteolysis, thereby defining subcellular locations of virus priming with greater precision. Implications of these findings extend to the use of virus entry antagonists, such as protease inhibitors, which might be most effective when localized to these microdomains.","output":"Coronavirus and influenza virus proteolytic priming takes place in tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many complications are associated with thoracic open decompression surgery, such as dural tears and neurological deficits.

METHODS: Fourteen patients with thoracic OLF (4 combined with dural ossification) underwent full-endoscopic decompression surgery. An interlaminar approach was performed. The anchoring method was used to establish the working passage. Spinal cord exposure began at a space between the ossification and the spinal cord, and dorsal and contralateral decompression were performed with the Over the Top technique.

Using machine learning in per-protocol effect estimation can help avoid model misspecification owing to strong parametric assumptions, as is common with standard methods (eg, logistic regression). OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the use of ensemble machine learning with augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) for per-protocol effect estimation in RCTs and to evaluate the per-protocol effect size of aspirin on pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This secondary analysis used data from 1227 women in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial, a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on pregnancy outcomes in women at high risk of pregnancy loss. Participants were recruited at 4 university medical centers in the US from June 15, 2007, to July 15, 2012. Women were followed up for 6 menstrual cycles for attempted pregnancy and 36 weeks of gestation if pregnancy occurred. Follow-up was completed on August 17, 2012. Data analyses were performed on July 9, 2021. EXPOSURES: Daily low-dose (81 mg) aspirin taken at least 5 of 7 days per week for at least 80% of follow-up time relative to placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pregnancy detected using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. RESULTS: Among the 1227 women included in the analysis (mean SD age, 28.74 [4.80] years), 1161 (94.6%) were non-Hispanic White and 858 (69.9%) adhered to the protocol. Five machine learning models were combined into 1 meta-algorithm, which was used to construct an AIPW estimator for the per-protocol effect. Compared with adhering to placebo, adherence to the daily low-dose aspirin protocol for at least 5 of 7 days per week was associated with an increase in the probability of hCG-detected pregnancy of 8.0 (95% CI, 2.5-13.6) more hCG-detected pregnancies per 100 women in the sample, which is substantially larger than the estimated intention-to-treat estimate of 4.3 (95% CI, ?1.1 to 9.6) more hCG-detected pregnancies per 100 women in the sample. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that a low-dose aspirin protocol is associated with increased hCG-detected pregnancy in women who adhere to treatment for at least 5 days per week. With the presence of nonadherence, per-protocol treatment effect estimates differ from intention-to-treat estimates in the EAGeR trial. The results of this secondary analysis of clinical trial data suggest that machine learning could be used to estimate per-protocol effects by adjusting for confounders related to nonadherence in a more flexible way than traditional regressions.

The behavior of this virus is extraordinarily peculiar and mutates frequently. So, the scientific community faces the problems to analyze and forecast the virus's growth and transmission capability. The combined effort of powerful Artificial intelligence and Image processing techniques to predict the initial pattern of COVID-19 disease identifies the most affected areas in each country through social networking information and predicts drug-protein interactions for making new drugs vaccines. However, AI-empowered X-Ray and computed tomography image acquisition and segmentation techniques help us identify and diagnose the COVID-19 affected patients with minimal contact. In this chapter, our primary motivation is to sum up the essential roles of some AI-driven techniques (Machine learning, Deep learning, etc.) and AI-empowered imaging techniques to analyze, predict, and diagnose against COVID-19 disease. An essential set of open challenges and future research issues on AI-empowered procedures for handling COVID-19 are also discussed in this chapter. Summary This paper mainly deals with the design of Machine Learning model for the analysis of transmission dynamics of Covid 19. The entire globe is affected because of Corona virus. Ventilator dependent, Severe Acute respiratory and quarantine care ICU patients frequently face difficulties for their most basic human interactions, namely communication due to either respiratory illness, language problem or intubated. ICU patients have serious implications with respect to physical and psychological due to non communication problems. Researchers have developed different types of services like Speech language Pathologist so that Augmentative and alternative communication assistance can be given to all health professionals and caretakers. A probabilistic model is designed to analyse the new cases and death cases. Using machine learning approach Regression model is designed and future predications are displayed. The adequacy of the model is discussed along with the residuals of new cased and death cases. PCF and APCAF are obtained. This paper mainly deals with a probabilistic model to analyse and predict the new cases and deaths of covid 19. A new transformation of analyzing stationarity is carried out and based on this forecasting is executed. Summary This research express an impression of automated decision-making techniques that have been suggested for scrutiny of data from IoT based healthcare systems. IoT data analytics plays a vital role in this modern era since data from connected devices reveal meaningful results with better insights for the future. The chapter involves the design of a decision-making system that collects data from IoT based healthcare systems, preprocess and analyzes data, and generates detailed information reports for better diagnosis. Data preprocessing methods such as data cleaning, munging, normalization, reduction, and removing noisy data are applied. The blend of IoT data with analytics technique results to be beneficial in healthcare systems. The collected IoT information like pulse rate, temperature, oxygen level and heart rate from connected devices can be used to analyze the need and severity in the preliminary stage itself using appropriate machine learning techniques. Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques such as SMART, WPM, and TOPSIS are also applied for conclusion production procedure to generate detailed informative diagnostic reports. Being healthcare data, the overall objective is to aid business organizations with better decision making processes through data analytics thereby deploying the right IoT strategy. The result of the next-generation expert systems can utilize the results for further analysis in diagnosis and treatment. Summary The proposed work deals with the design and development of touch and native voice-assisted prototype to enable the intuitive communication & interaction between health professionals and patients who are affected with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), Ventilator-dependent and admitted in Quarantine care. It also ensures the development of the multilingual capability to communicate effectively in most speaking ten Indian languages, so that the patients will be relieved from pains etc., as their queries are being addressed by health professionals. In this prototype, touch based gesture patterns can be effectively used as an interactive module and helps the doctors to monitor and answer to the queries of ICU patients regularly by updating it to the caretakers such that the patients are at ease to express their emotions or pains. The proposed prototype will be made available and accessible in an open software repository. As per the existing methods patients express their needs through non-verbal communication methods and they could be missed out or misinterpreted resulting in symptoms that are poorly understood and the clinicians overestimate their ability to understand their communication feelings. These situations are eradicated by employing the use of ?Touch Voice of SARI? Application. Hence this can be considered as an assistive communication tool which replaces the nonverbal communication to a meaningful communication for ventilator patients and healthcare professionals.","output":"The Implementation of AI and AI-Empowered Imaging System to Fight Against COVID-19A Review Implementation of Machine Learning Techniques for the Analysis of Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Data-Driven Decision Making in IoT Healthcare SystemsCOVID-19: A Case Study Touch and Voice-Assisted Multilingual Communication Prototype for ICU Patients Specific to COVID19 Cerebral Venous Thrombosis post BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A Black Swan Event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing routine healthcare to patients with serious health illnesses represents a challenge to healthcare providers amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Treating cancer patients during this pandemic is even more complex due to their heightened vulnerability, as both cancer and cancer treatment weaken the immune system leading to a higher risk of both infections and severe complications In addition to the need to protect cancer patients from unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection during their routine care, interruption, and discontinuation of cancer treatment can result in negative consequences on patients' health, in addition to the ghost of rationing healthcare resources in high demand during a global health crisis This article aims to explore the ethical dilemmas faced by decision-makers and healthcare providers caring for cancer patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic This includes setting triage criteria for non-infected cancer patients, fairly allocating limited healthcare resources between cancer patients and SARS-CoV-2 patients, prioritizing SARS-CoV-2 treatment or vaccine, once developed, for cancer patients and non-cancer patients, patient-physician communication on matters such as end-of-life and do-not-resuscitate (DNR), and lastly, shifting physicians' priorities from treating their own cancer patients to treating critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients Ultimately, no straightforward decision can be easily made at such exceptionally difficult times Applying different ethical principles can result in very different scenarios and consequences In the end, we will briefly share the experience of the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), the only standalone comprehensive cancer center in the region","output":"Ethical Considerations for Treating Cancer Patients During the SARS-CoV-2 Virus Crisis: To Treat or Not to Treat?

Consequently, it seems that the increase in the triple burden of food insecurity, poverty and malnutrition compounded with social injustice and income inequality is inevitable for the urban poor African immigrants in South Africa. Even though the Government may not have the capacity to address food insecurity by itself, the Government should endeavour to make the limited resources to access food equally available to all with no social injustice. By working hand in hand with foreign national associations, township councillors and other stakeholders, such as the food banks and faith-based organisations, that have stepped forward to try and bridge the widening incapacity of the Government to feed the food insecure, the nexus of food insecurity and social injustice of African immigrants will be alleviated.","output":"Food insecurity and social injustice: The plight of urban poor African immigrants in South Africa during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Cycling as a form of active transport has great benefits for individuals and society, yet prevalence rates in many countries are low. The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is likely to have substantial implications for cyclists, however little is known about the nature and magnitude of the likely impacts and the resulting implications for government planning and policy. The aim of this exploratory study was to consult with a range of stakeholder groups to identify relevant issues and stimulate debate about future efforts to maximize the benefits of vehicle autonomy for cycling outcomes. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders representing government (local, state, and federal departments responsible for transport, health, and/or infrastructure), cycling organizations, technology firms, AV manufacturing/servicing companies, trade unions, the law, insurers (public and private), transport policy consortia, and academia. The results suggest that AVs have the potential to increase cycling prevalence while reducing cycling accidents, but that a range of issues will need to be addressed to optimize these outcomes.

There are no studies on an extended intravenous ketamine protocol and its synergies with common neuropathy treatments to treat CNP. This study aims to 1) evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an intravenous ketamine protocol to treat refractory CNP and 2) uncover synergies between ketamine and common neuropathy treatments. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective review of 57 patients and 192 infusions, with prospective follow-up on 14 enrolled patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. RESULTS: The etiologies of CNP were as follows: 13 from tumor compression, 25 with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, 13 from surgery, and 6 from radiation therapy. Overall, 42 of 57 patients (73.7%) were responders, and 71.8% of responders received >3 weeks of pain relief on their last infusion. Analysis of adjuvant treatments revealed that the combination of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and ketamine resulted in an increase in responders compared with nonresponders (P < 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 32 of 192 infusions (16.7%). All side effects self-resolved or resolved with intervention per the adverse events protocol. During the pandemic, all 14 currently enrolled patients did not receive ketamine infusions. Thirteen of the 14 patients returned to baseline pain, with 61.5% increasing medications. All experienced worsened function, mobility, mood, or anorexia. CONCLUSION: Intravenous ketamine may be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for CNP, especially with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italys Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model. To include non-locality into mathematical formulas, differential and integral operators were suggested. Properties and numerical approximations were presented in details. Finally, the suggested differential and integral operators were applied to the model.","output":"Modelling the spread of COVID-19 with new fractal-fractional operators: Can the lockdown save mankind before vaccination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental education enables students to critically analyze their impact on the world while producing environmentally knowledgeable and engaged global citizens with the skills and motivation necessary to participate in developing and implementing solutions to societal and environmental challenges.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether experienced and perceived racial discrimination were associated with mental or behavioral health outcomes during the pandemic. DESIGN: In October 2020, we conducted a national survey with minorities oversampled that covered respondents sociodemographic background and health-related information. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2709 participants responded to the survey (response rate: 4.2%). MAIN MEASURES: The exposure variables included (1) experienced and encountered racial discrimination, (2) experienced racial and ethnic cyberbullying, and (3) perceived racial bias. Mental health outcomes were measured by psychological distress and self-rated happiness. Measures for behavioral health included sleep quality, change in cigarette smoking, and change in alcohol consumption. Weighted logistic regressions were performed to estimate the associations between the exposure variables and the outcomes, controlling for age, gender, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, household income, eligibility to vote, political party, COVID-19 infection, and geographic region. Separate regressions were performed in the six racial and ethnic subgroups: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian respondents. KEY RESULTS: Experienced racial discrimination was associated with higher likelihood of psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.34C3.55). Experienced racial discrimination (AOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.34C3.99) and perceived racial bias (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00C1.09) were both associated with increased cigarette smoking. The associations between racial discrimination and mental distress and substance use were most salient among Black, East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Racial discrimination may be associated with higher likelihood of distress, and cigarette smoking among racial and ethnic minorities.

Dogs fed BP had greater fecal total short-chain fatty acid concentration than the CO treatment (P < 0.05), while the dogs fed diets containing MF were intermediate. In a two-bowl palatability trial, no significant preference was observed between the extruded diets containing MF and CO (P > 0.05). However, a significant preference for the extruded diet containing BP over the diet containing only MF was observed (P < 0.05). The -diversity of fecal microbial communities was not impacted by treatment (P > 0.05), but ?-diversity indicated that dogs fed the BP diet differed from the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). The data from this study suggest that miscanthus grass can be successfully utilized in fiber blends in extruded diets for adult dogs, with modulatory effects similar to the traditional dietary fiber source, cellulose.","output":"Functional properties of miscanthus fiber and prebiotic blends in extruded canine diets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection was assigned the status of a pandemic. As of the beginning of 2021, the Russian Federation ranks fourth in terms of the prevalence of coronavirus infection. Over the period from March 2020 to February 2021, more than 84,000 fatal cases of the disease were recorded in Russia. AIM: However, at the moment, there are no medications with proven effectiveness and safety against the novel coronavirus infection. In this regard, the purpose of our study was to conduct a pharmacoeconomic analysis of medications for etiotropic therapy of all forms of COVID-19 recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (clinical guidelines, version 10 dated February 8, 2021) to identify the best treatment option. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the course of the study, the cost of illness was determined for all forms of the disease in an outpatient and inpatient setting. The authors took into account the direct medical costs of medication therapy and diagnostic and treatment procedures. In terms of direct non-medical costs, they calculated the cost of a bed-day excluding medication treatment, and indirect costs included payments for temporary disability sheets. Costs for medications were calculated based on the active ingredient (AI) and the packages for treatment on an outpatient basis and in the case of the hospital setting based on the AI only. The cost of medical and diagnostic procedures was determined based on the Tariff Agreement for 2020 dated December 30, 2019. Next, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. Effectiveness criteria were selected based on published clinical trial results for the medications in question. Then, they performed a calculation of the cost-effectiveness coefficients and an incremental analysis. RESULTS: Thus, in the course of the analysis of the cost of illness, the most economically profitable treatment regimens were the ones with hydroxychloroquine both for outpatient treatment (13,150.31 rubles: Mild form, 22,326.44 rubles: Moderate form excluding antibiotic therapy, and 21,513.76 rubles: Moderate form, taking into account antibacterial therapy) and for inpatient treatment (34,441.53 rubles). CONCLUSION: As a result of the cost-effectiveness analysis, the use of favipiravir can be considered optimal (comparative effectiveness research = 17,607.14 rubles), and for the mild form, the optimal medication is umifenovir, since during the incremental analysis, it was found that for therapy with favipiravir, 100 people would need an additional allocation of 96.291 rubles, which, given the form of the disease, is not entirely appropriate.","output":"Pharmacoeconomic analysis of treatment regimens for coronavirus infection coronavirus disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observing voices claim that times are troubling, when they really mean that times are interesting Interesting to analyse society when it supposedly lays bare its hidden structures","output":"Contagion and memory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for COVID-19 has been shown to infect a number of species.

For sows, a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows (p < 0.05). The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of GM structure among healthy, asymptomatic, and diarrheal sows. For piglets, Bacteroidetes, the dominant bacteria in healthy piglets, were replaced by Firmicutes in asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets. The abundances of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were also remarkably increased in asymptomatic piglets and diarrheal piglets when compared to those of the healthy piglets.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Germany, the diagnostic outcomes of critically ill patients admitted to the resuscitation room in the ED of our academic 754-bed hospital should be analyzed. METHODS: All resuscitation room patients between March 1st and April 15th 2020 were included in this retrospective study. Every patient with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a pharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), divided in the clinical subgroups of highly suspicious for COVID-19 and COVID-19 as differential diagnosis. All respiratory and infectious symptoms were included as at least differential diagnosis as an expanded suspicion strategy. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included (trauma n = 14, critically ill n = 81). Of 3 highly suspicious patients, 2 had rt-PCR positive pharyngeal swabs. In 39 patients, COVID-19 was defined as differential diagnosis, and 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of them, pharyngeal swabs were positive in 1 case, while in 2 cases, only tracheal fluid was rt-PCR positive while the pharyngeal swabs were negative. In one of these 2 cases, chest computed tomography (CT) was also negative for ground-glass opacities but showed a pulmonary abscess and pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: We recommend an expanded suspicion strategy for COVID-19 due to unexpected diagnostic outcomes. Personal protective equipment should be used in every resuscitation room operation due to unexpected cases and initial knowledge gaps. Furthermore, tracheal fluid should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in every intubated patient due to cases with negative pharyngeal swabs and negative chest CT.","output":"Characteristics and Unexpected COVID-19 Diagnoses in Resuscitation Room Patients during the COVID-19 OutbreakA Retrospective Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schiff bases (SBs) have extensive applications in different fields such as analytical, inorganic and organic chemistry.

METHOD: 32 semi-structured interviews were administered to a not probabilistic sample of the different professional roles (coordinators, nurses, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists, community animators) of a Human Services Company in Reggio Emilia (Italy). This includes day-care and residential care facilities for the elderly. RESULTS: The thematic content analysis showed that inter-professional collaboration and positive relationships with superiors, colleagues and elderly people favour the job satisfaction, while workload, high responsibilities, reduction of rest periods and contributory inequity create dissatisfaction. The work engagement is favoured by professional autonomy, a sense of belonging, professional growth, specific training, while it is disadvantaged by scarce career opportunities, job insecurity and low recognition of one's contribution. Finally, inadequate pay, work load, high turnover and strong emotional experiences related to elderly people increase work-related stress/burnout, while working autonomy, psychological support and good relationships with the elderly reduce it. Some specificities were found according to the different professional roles and the type of services offered. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest organizational improvement strategies that take these factors into account.

Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6  10-3 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95  10-8 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2  10-3) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (&#967;2 p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.","output":"Incomplete Systemic Recovery and Metabolic Phenoreversion in Post-Acute-Phase Nonhospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Implications for Assessment of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last decade has witnessed three major pandemics caused by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV that belong to Coronavirus family.

In this study, using computational approach, we designed a peptide (Peptide 7) that can bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV thereby preventing the entry of the viruses into the host cell. The peptide inhibitor was designed as a consensus peptide from three different peptides that might individually bind to the RBD of the three viruses. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations using Peptide 7 has shown that it binds with higher affinity than the native receptors of the RBD and forms a stable complex thereby preventing further viral-receptor interaction and inhibiting their cellular entry. This effective binding is observed for the three RBDs, despite the Peptide 7 interactions being slightly different.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine the utility of providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS: An epidemiologic time series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020, to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was used for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain, and the US states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS: Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia and ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r>0.60, P<.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated real-world confirmed cases by 12 days (r=0.85, SD 0.10 and r=0.76, SD 0.09, respectively, P<.001). Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag greater than 1 week compared to new daily cases, while searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19.

One of the less common sequelae of this illness is myocarditis. Here we present an interesting case of delayed onset myocarditis which occurred following COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female with a past medical history significant for obesity presented with complaints of dull, left sided chest pain. She had associated symptoms of diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and nausea. Patient denied prior history of angina. Patient had a strong family history of coronary artery disease.Chest pain was reproducible with palpation to the chest. EKG showed T wave inversions in anterolateral and inferior leads. Troponin was elevated to 1.12 ng/mL (<0.05 ng/mL) and trended up to 9.57 ng/mL. NT proBNP was mildly elevated to 253 pg/mL (<126 pg/mL). Chest x-ray revealed no acute abnormalities. Patient tested positive for COVID-19 six months prior to admission. During the current admission patient's COVID-19 PCR was negative. Patient was given aspirin 324mg and started on heparin and nitroglycerin infusions.Echocardiography showed hypokinesis of apical myocardium and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 60%. Patient was taken for coronary angiogram which revealed normal coronary arteries without evidence of stenosis or spasm. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed increased signal in the mid-apical septum on short tau inversion recovery image (STIR) suggestive of edema or inflammation. LV systolic function was normal;however, hypokinesis of the apical septal wall was noted. These findings on MRI are highly suggestive of acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy was not performed as the patient was hemodynamically stable and showed no signs of heart failure or arrhythmia. DISCUSSION: A meta-analysis of 8971 hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients demonstrated that 20.0% of patient's had myocardial injury manifested by elevated troponin I levels [1]. Guo et al showed 28% of patients with COVID-19 had evidence of myocardial injury (elevated troponin T greater than 99th percentile upper limit) and Chen et al showed elevated BNP in 27.5% of patients. There have been reports of patients with myocarditis during active episodes of COVID-19 infection but limited published literature provides insight into patients who may develop myocardial injury in the time following the primary COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents an interesting presentation of delayed onset myocarditis following COVID-19 infection which must be considered in the differential for patients who present with NSTEMI. Delayed onset could be suggestive of prolonged systemic inflammatory response in the setting of COVID-19. It also displays a less frequently identified sequela of COVID-19 infection.

In 2016, more than 276 million cases of neurological disorders were reported worldwide. Moreover, neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death. Generally, the etiology of neurological diseases is not fully understood. Recent studies have related the onset of neurological disorders to viral infections, which may cause neurological symptoms or lead to immune responses that trigger these pathological signs. Currently, this relationship is mostly based on epidemiological data on infections and seroprevalence of patients who present with neurological disorders. The number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action by which viral infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of neurological disorders has been increasing over the years but these studies are still scarce. Comprehending the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel theories may favor the development of new strategies for diagnosis and therapy in the future. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to review the main pieces of evidence for the relationship between viral infection and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Guillain-Barr syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Viruses belonging to the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Retroviridae have been reported to be involved in one or more of these conditions. Also, neurological symptoms and the future impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family Coronaviridae that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019, are reported and discussed.","output":"Viral infections and their relationship to neurological disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients are at increased risks of novelcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, surgical strategies for cancer patients with COVID-19 are generally suggested to be properly delayed. Case presentation: We presented a 69-year-old Chinese female colon cancer patientwith COVID-19, the first case accepted the surgical treatment during the epidemic season in China. Thepatient developed a fever on January 28, 2020. After treatments with Ceftriaxone and Abidol, her fever was not reduced yet. A repeat chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed the infectious lesions significantly exacerbated, with a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid. An abdomen CT scan indicated the tumor of ascending colon with local wrapped changes. She was diagnosed with Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia and Incomplete bowel obstruction: Colon cancer?. After actively anti-inflammatory and anti-viral therapies, aright colectomy with lymph node dissection was performed on March 11. The pathological changes of tissue specimens were further investigated.The patient successfully recovered from COVID-19 and surgery, without any postoperative related complications, and was discharged on the 9th day after operation.

In this study, 66 epitopes containing pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the IEDB database were compared with the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 66 potentially immune-related peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained. Based on the SNPs analysis of spike protein of 1218 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, 52 easily mutated sites were identified and used for vaccine epitope screening. The best vaccine candidate epitopes in the 66 peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were screened out through mutation and immunoinformatics analysis. The best candidate epitopes were connected by different linkers in silico to obtain vaccine candidate sequences. The results showed that 16 epitopes were relatively conservative, immunological, non-toxic and non-allergenic, could induce the secretion of cytokines and more likely to be exposed on the surface of spike protein. They were both B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes, which could recognize a certain number of HLA molecules and had high coverage rates in different populations. Moreover, epitopes 897-913 were predicted possible cross-immunoprotection for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The results of vaccine candidate sequences screening suggested that sequences (without linker, with linker GGGSGGG, EAAAK, GPGPG and KK, respectively) were the best.

We show that these forces can be analyzed in real time using a flow decomposition of the changes in the labor force participation rate. The decomposition reveals that the source of the participation cycle is fluctuations in job-loss and job-finding rates, rather than cyclical movements in labor force entry and exit rates. The magnitude of the participation cycle is large. Cyclical downward pressures on employment from participation are two-thirds that of unemployment. Moreover, the participation cycle delays the recovery in employment because it lags the unemployment cycle. It also amplifies the unevenness of the impact of recessions. Groups that see large increases in their unemployment rates also experience more pronounced participation cycles. Despite differences in their magnitudes, the source of the participation cycle is the same for all groups. Application of our method to the COVID-19 Recession suggests that, as of June 2021, the bulk of the drop in the participation rate since the onset of the pandemic is cyclical and that the cyclical recovery in participation likely will trail that of the unemployment rate.","output":"Maximum Employment and the Participation Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a shift to online teaching, which has dramatically affected all facets of the student experience.

For the first time, the current study has aimed to compare the contributors of thromboembolism among those whose primary manifestations of COVID-19 were thrombosis vs the patients with a thrombotic event during the period of hospitalization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This case-control study has been conducted on 267 COVID-19 patients, including 59, 48, and 160 ones with an on-admission, in-hospital, and without a thrombotic event, respectively. The events were defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The demographic, physical examination, clinical and laboratory assessments of the groups were compared. RESULTS: The DVT (OR: 5.18; 95% CI: 1.01-26.7), AMI (OR: 11.1; 95% CI: 2.36-52.3), and arterial thrombosis (OR: 5.93; 95% CI: 0.63-55.8) were significantly associated with an on-admission thrombosis compared to those who presented in-hospital events. Lower levels of oxygen saturation were the only significant predictor index inversely associated with on-admission thrombosis compared to those with an event during the hospital admission period. CONCLUSION: PTE development was the most common in-hospital thrombotic event, whereas other thromboembolism types were remarkably more often among cases with on-admission events.

Design/methodology/approach - In the Covid-19 pandemic context, quantitative data were collected using self-administrated questionnaires from entrepreneurs (founders of small-sized restaurants and travel agents in Egypt) using structural equation modeling. Findings - The study reveals that entrepreneurs' resilience under adversities directly correlates with business continuity indicators, with adaptive performance and institutional orientation functioning as mediators. Research limitations/implications - The socio-demographic characteristics of entrepreneurs could be further investigated to observe the differences based on age, education and region. The type of business (i.e. restaurants and travel agents) could have an impact on the examined relationships. Therefore, further studies can use multi-group analysis to examine such differences between various sub-sectors of the hospitality business. Finally, the cross-sectional sample method used in this study is another limitation. In any study in which causality is inferred, longitudinal research confirms stronger inferences (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Practical implications - An instant implication is that entrepreneurs can take proactive actions to enhance their resilience. Entrepreneurs should seek to influence their own skills and abilities through various educational and training programs. For example, they can take advantage of business seminars, workshops and executive education courses. Entrepreneurs who have the chance of enhancing their skills in solving complex problems, identifying their strengths, managing their emotions are better able to adapt to unfavorable circumstances. Social implications - The inhabited environment. Entrepreneurs should be institutionally oriented by building strong communications and networks with key actors and business-to-business customers. This would help entrepreneurs to understand the rules of the game, adapt to the environment, gain market legitimacy and accordingly acquire the social and financial support when hazards occur. Originality/value - The extant literature lacks evidence about the internal and external contextual factors underlying the process of resilience in small and medium-sized enterprises and its outcomes.

We investigated the characteristics of a field strain of PEDV (PEDV strain SH) isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in Shanghai China. Whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399C410) including the antigenic epitope NEP-1C9 (aa 398C406) of the N protein.

Sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) have always been sites of power contestations within families, societies, cultures, and politics; these struggles are exacerbated by economic, racial, religious, caste, citizenship status, and other social inequities, especially in times of crisis such as these. Policy responses to the COVID pandemic such as lockdown, quarantine, contact tracing and similar measures are premised on the existence of a social contract between the government and the people and among people, with the health sector playing a key role in preventive and curative care. We propose the use of an intersectional lens to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social contract, drawing on our field experiences from different continents particularly as related to SRHR. Along with documenting the ways in which the pandemic hinders access to services, we note that it is essential to interrogate state-society relations in the context of vulnerable and marginalized groups, in order to understand implications for SRHR. Intersectional analysis takes on greater importance now than in non-pandemic times as the state exercises more police or other powers and deploys myriad ways of othering. We conclude that an intersectional analysis should not limit itself to the cumulative disadvantages and injustices posed by the pandemic for specific social groups, but also examine the historical inequalities, structural drivers, and damaged social contract that underlie state-society relationships. At the same time, the pandemic has questioned the status quo and in doing so it has provided opportunities for disruption; for re-imagining a social contract that reaches across sectors, and builds community resilience and solidarities while upholding human rights and gender justice.

We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.","output":"COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system: implications for risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic that broke out in Chinese Wuhan at the beginning of 2020 presented how important the rapid diagnosis of malnutrition (elevating during intensive care unit stay) and the immediate implementation of caloric and protein-balanced nutrition care are.

We aimed to identify prognostic clinical and laboratory factors that predict progression to severe disease in febrile children presenting from the community. METHODS: We systematically reviewed publications retrieved from MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase between 31 May 1999 and 30 April 2020, supplemented by hand search of reference lists and consultation with an expert Technical Advisory Panel. Studies evaluating prognostic factors or clinical prediction models in children presenting from the community with febrile illnesses were eligible. The primary outcome was any objective measure of disease severity ascertained within 30 days of enrolment. We calculated unadjusted likelihood ratios (LRs) for comparison of prognostic factors, and compared clinical prediction models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Risk of bias and applicability of studies were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. RESULTS: Of 5949 articles identified, 18 studies evaluating 200 prognostic factors and 25 clinical prediction models in 24 530 children were included. Heterogeneity between studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Malnutrition (positive LR range 1.56C11.13), hypoxia (2.10C8.11), altered consciousness (1.24C14.02), and markers of acidosis (1.36C7.71) and poor peripheral perfusion (1.78C17.38) were the most common predictors of severe disease. Clinical prediction model performance varied widely (AUROC range 0.49C0.97). Concerns regarding applicability were identified and most studies were at high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies address this important public health question. We identified prognostic factors from a wide range of geographic contexts that can help clinicians assess febrile children at risk of progressing to severe disease. Multicentre studies that include outpatients are required to explore generalisability and develop data-driven tools to support patient prioritisation and triage at the community level.

This genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in diverse African nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an African forest giant pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, amended, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs are established relying on a newly established open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV + PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV + simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant pouched rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is divided into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American types of PRRSV, both of which now receive virus status.

However, only dipstick tests have been frequently used thus far. Here, the quantification and characterization of proteinuria were investigated and their association with mortality was assessed. METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single center study included 153 patients, hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 28th and April 30th, 2020, in whom total proteinuria and urinary (1)-microglobulin (a marker of tubular injury) were measured. Association with mortality was evaluated, with a follow-up until May 7th, 2020. RESULTS: According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging, 14% (n = 21) of the patients had category 1 proteinuria (< 150 mg/g of urine creatinine), 42% (n = 64) had category 2 (between 150 and 500 mg/g) and 44% (n = 68) had category 3 proteinuria (over 500 mg/g). Urine (1)-microglobulin concentration was higher than 15 mg/g in 89% of patients. After a median follow-up of 27 [14;30] days, the mortality rate reached 18%. Total proteinuria and urinary (1)-microglobulin were associated with mortality in unadjusted and adjusted models. This association was stronger in subgroups of patients with normal renal function and without a urinary catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria is frequent in patients with COVID-19.

Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01).

The DNA fragments of 11 target genes associated with quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance were artificially synthesized, inserted into plasmid vectors, and transferred into recipient cells. PCR and sequencing of DNA were performed to assess the genetic stability of the target DNA in recombinant Escherichia coli DH5 cells during subculturing for 15 generations. The limit of detection (LOD) of the target DNA was determined using PCR and real-time qualitative PCR (qPCR). The homogeneity and storage stability of plasmid DNA reference materials were evaluated in terms of plasmid DNA quantity, PCR-measured gene expression, and qPCR threshold cycle. All 11 target DNAs were successfully synthesized and inserted into vectors to obtain recombinant plasmids. No nucleotide mutations were identified in the target DNA being stably inherited and detectable in the corresponding plasmids during subculturing of recombinant strains. When the target DNA was assessed using PCR and qPCR, the LOD was 1.77  10(5) and 3.26  10(4) copies/L, respectively. Further, when the reference materials were stored at 37 C for 13 days, 4 C for 90 days, and ?20 C for 300 days, each target DNA was detectable by PCR, and no mutations were found. Although the threshold cycle values of qPCR varied with storage time, they were above the LOD, and no significant differences were found in the quantity of each plasmid DNA at different timepoints. Further, the homogeneity and stability of the materials were highly consistent with the requirements of standard reference materials.

Telehealth may be an alternative way to follow these patients remotely. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telehealth in the management of patients with AIH. The COVID-19 outbreak during the study period provided an opportunity to evaluate any pandemic influence on how telehealth was perceived by patients and physicians. METHODS We included patients with AIH who were followed in the Harran University hospital, Turkey. Patients were managed by either remote telehealth or standard care. The clinical courses of these two groups were compared. RESULTS A total of 46 (telehealth, n=19 and standard care, n= 27) patients (40 female) with a median age of 32 (range 17-74) years at diagnosis were included in the study. Until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020), the rates of biochemical remission and relapse after remission were similar in the telehealth and standard care groups (89.5% vs. 89.1% and 15.8% vs. 25.9%, p=ns, for both). The telehealth group maintained remission significantly better than the standard care group (100% vs. 77.3%, p=0.035) during the COVID-19 period. All relapses were due to non-adherence to therapy.

However, the roles of these distinct T cell pools in infections that are cleared over the course of several weeks are not understood. Clearance of the highly virulent intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis (Ftt) following pulmonary infection of immune animals is a protracted T cell-dependent process requiring 30-40 d and serves as a model for infections that are not acutely controlled. Using this model, we found that intranasal vaccination increased the number of tissue-resident CD4+ effector T cells, and subsequent challenge of immune mice with Ftt led to a significant expansion of polyfunctional parenchymal CD4+ effector T cells compared with the circulating pool. Despite the dominant in vivo response by parenchymal CD4+ T cells after vaccination and challenge, circulating CD4+ T cells were superior at controlling intracellular Ftt replication in vitro. Further examination in vivo revealed temporal requirements for resident and circulating T cells during Ftt infection. These requirements were in direct contrast to other pulmonary infections that are cleared rapidly in immune animals.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study using exploratory analysis of hospital administrative data. SETTING: All 500 National Health Service hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: All hospitalised COVID-19 patients aged 18 years in England between 1 March and 31 October 2020 were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative data set. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the relationship between demographic factors, comorbidity and use of tracheostomy and the association between tracheostomy use, tracheostomy timing and the outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 2200 hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a tracheostomy. Tracheostomy utilisation varied across the study period, peaking in April-June 2020. In multivariable modelling, for those admitted to critical care, tracheostomy was most common in those aged 40-79 years, in males and in people of Black and Asian ethnic groups and those with a history of cerebrovascular disease. In critical care patients, tracheostomy was associated with lower odds of mortality (OR: 0.514 [95% CI 0.443 to 0.596], but greater length of stay OR: 41.143 [95% CI 30.979 to 54.642]). In patients that survived, earlier timing of tracheostomy (14 days post admission to critical care) was significantly associated with shorter length of stay.

However, the impact of COVID-19 among patients with pre-existing liver disease remains ill-defined. METHODS: Data for CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 were collected by two international registries. Comparisons were made with non-CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a UK hospital network. RESULTS: Between 25th March and 8th July 2020, 745 CLD patients were reported from 29 countries including 386 with cirrhosis and 359 without. Mortality was 32% in patients with cirrhosis compared with 8% in those without (p<0.001). Mortality in cirrhosis patients increased according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class (CTP-A (19%), CTP-B (35%), CTP-C (51%)) and the main cause of death was respiratory failure (71%). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, factors associated with death in the total CLD cohort were age (OR 1.02; 1.01C1.04), CTP-A (OR 1.90; 1.03C3.52), CTP-B (OR 4.14; 2.4C7.65), CTP-C cirrhosis (OR 9.32; 4.80C18.08) and alcohol related liver disease (ALD) (OR 1.79; 1.03C3.13). When comparing CLD versus non-CLD (n=620) in propensity-score-matched analysis there were significant increases in mortality with CTP-B +20.0% (8.8%C31.3%) and CTP-C cirrhosis +38.1% (27.1%C49.2%). Acute hepatic decompensation occurred in 46% of patients with cirrhosis, of which 21% had no respiratory symptoms. 50% of those with hepatic decompensation had acute-on-chronic liver failure.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses are limited. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools include the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: The scores of SAS, SOS and GSES range from 20 to 80, 22 to 110 and 10 to 40, respectively, and the SAS (31.79  7.32) and SOS (40.19  12.92) and GSES scores (24.83  6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r = .679, p < .001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r = -.326, p < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p = .006, <.001, <.001, .039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The current study suggests work stress reduction might be a key factor in reducing anxiety and maintaining mental health to support nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection.","output":"Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Self-efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"201912±͹״ײѸϯȫ ھٹ־ɳǿ,ͨǿ֪ʶͼѵ,չڿ,ģ黯ʽѵȾٴ,ʵͨרѧԱĸλʤ,ͬӮⳡߴս","output":"How to manage the standardized fellowship training in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is suffering its deadly pandemic in decades from Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We determined the functional part of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs were predicted by analysis of the functional part using the PDBsum/DrugPort. Molecular Docking unveiled the binding of those drugs to the target spike.

Although the literature on conceptual advancements of GHD exists, empirical studies about how health becomes an issue of relevance for foreign policy are scarce. We present an analysis of the entry processes of health into the foreign policy and diplomatic domains in Mexico from the perspective of key informants of three different sectors. METHODS: A purposive sample of high-rank representatives of three sectors involved in GHD was designed: Two from Health Sector (HS), four from Foreign Affairs Sector (FAS), and three from Non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted exploring the topics of: (1) Health concerns entering diplomatic and foreign policy; (2) Processes that allow actors to influence foreign policy and negotiation and; (3) Impact of multilateral negotiations on decision-making at the national level. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that GHD in Mexico is hierarchically driven by the FAS and health concerns only enter foreign policy when they are relevant to national priorities (such as trade or security). HS possesses a lesser degree of influence in GHD, serving as an instance of consultation for the FAS when deciding on health-related issues at global meetings (i.e., World Health Assembly). NGOs resort to lobbying, advocacy, networking, and coalition-working practices with other sectors (academy, think-tanks) to prevent harmful impacts on local health from multilateral decisions and as a mean to compensate its power asymmetry for influencing GHD processes in relation to the government. CONCLUSIONS: GHD in Mexico occurs in a context of asymmetric power relationships where government actors have the strongest influence. However, NGOs experience in raising awareness of health risks needs to be weighted by government decision-makers. This situation calls for capacity building on intersectoral communication and coordination to create formal mechanisms of GHD practices, including the professionalization and training on GHD among government agencies.

STUDY DESIGN Animal cohort. SETTING Academic hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Three skin grafts were created using a pneumatic microtome on the dorsum of 12 rats. Rats were evenly divided into experimental (n = 6) and control (n = 6) groups. The experimental group received a thin layer of fibrin glue between the graft and wound bed, and the control group was secured with standard bolsters. Adherence strength of the skin graft was tested by measurement of force required to sheer the graft from the recipient wound. Adhesion strength measurements were taken on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS The experimental group required an average force of 719 g on POD1, 895 g on POD2, and 676 g on POD3, while the average force in the control group was 161 g on POD1, 257 g on POD2, and 267 g on POD3. On each of the 3 PODs, there was a significant difference in adherence strength between the experimental and control groups (P = .036, P = .029, P = .024).

Conferences, such as the annual NESPS, are important opportunities to increase visibility of female role models and resources to address deterrents to surgical careers. We thus sought to examine the participation and visibility of women in the NESPS over the last decade. METHODS: Abstracts and programs from the NESPS regional conferences between 2013 and 2019 were accessed via the publicly available past meetings archives, and registration lists were provided by the NESPS. Registrants, panelists, speakers, moderators, and first author and senior author listed for each poster presentation, podium presentation was listed, sex was determined (male or female), and sex were aggregated by category of participation. Significance was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: Registration of women for the NESPS annual conferences was constant for 5 years (2013-2017), followed by an increase in female registrants from 27.1% in 2017 to 42.3% in 2019. Female representation among poster and podium presentations also increased from 2017 to 2019 (7.7%-23.3% poster presentations and 11.1%-23.4% podium presentations). Invited positions (speakers, panelists, and moderators) had a peak of 32.2% in 2017, but otherwise, there is no clear evidence of improved representation of women. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increase in the proportion of female registrants at the annual NESPS conferences from 2013 to 2019. However, visibility of female participants fluctuated over the same period; addressing this represents one opportunity for closing the gender gap at the NESPS. As the percentage of female trainees continues to rise, we look to female faculty to continue to participate in educational events, such as the NESPS meeting, and to be present as role models for the growing new generation of female plastic surgeons.","output":"A New Decade for Diversity: Trends in Representation of Women at the Northeastern Society of Plastic Surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a large unmet need for follow-up services, particularly for chronic diseases such as epilepsy. Alternative methods to reach these people have become necessary. We assessed the feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness of video teleconsultation using mobile phones for managing persons with epilepsy (PWEs) on follow-up at a tertiary care center in the southern part of India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included PWEs aged 18a?years and over who have been evaluated in person within the past six months, with details available in electronic health records (EHRs), and advised regular follow-up after getting telephonic consent. We excluded those requiring emergency care and those seeking teleconsultation for new symptoms. Participants were sent a message in English and in the local language about the possibility of a video teleconsultation. If willing, they were informed about the date, time, and technical requirements such as smartphones, browsing facilities, etc. Feasibility and effectiveness were assessed. Satisfaction/acceptability was assessed using Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: From June 2020 to October 2020, we selected 336 PWEs after screening 1100 records, and we tried video teleconsultation in 141 (41.8%) PWEs. We achieved successful video connections in 95 (28.2%) and audio consultations in 46 (13.6%). The median duration for calling the participants, making successful connections, and consultation was 8 (5-14) min. The majority required two (47.4%) or three (32.6%) attempts. Sixty-five PWEs (68.4%) used caretaker's mobile phones. We gave prescriptions to all, and 18 received new drugs. Out of 95 PWEs, 90% either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' on 12 out of 14 telemedicine satisfaction questions. CONCLUSION: Although we need to make video teleconsultation more feasible, our synchronous mobile video teleconsultation model is an effective and acceptable method to follow up PWEs. This real-time model has the advantage that it does not require any mobile application to be downloaded and installed. Further studies are needed to evaluate methods to improve the reach of these services particularly to vulnerable groups of the population.","output":"Video teleconsultation services for persons with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic: An exploratory study from public tertiary care hospital in Southern India on feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The geopolitics of pandemics and climate change intersect.

Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3 months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother-baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers' mental disorders and infants' neurobehavioral disorders. RESULTS: All cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3 months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother-baby separation was 35 days (interquartile range 16 to 52 days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother-baby separation (median 8 days; IQR 5 to 23 days).

While secure attachment is associated with better outcomes, insecure attachment is associated with a higher risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Children referred to mental health services show much higher rates of insecure attachment than the general population, yet the parent-child relationship is rarely in treatment focus. Attachment quality is closely associated with parental sensitive responsiveness that is target of attachment-based interventions like Circle of Security (COS). COS has shown to improve attachment quality and the well-being of both children and parents. No randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of COS on parental sensitivity and child psychiatric symptoms in child mental health services. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether COS-Parenting (COS-P) can increase observed maternal sensitivity and decrease childrens psychiatric symptoms as an add on to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: In a randomized controlled parallel superiority trial COS-P is compared with TAU for parents of children referred to child mental health services (n = 186). Families are randomized 2:1 to intervention or control group, if their child is between 3 and 8 years old and scores  93(d) percentile on both the CBCL total score and the oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder subscale. Primary outcome is maternal sensitivity, secondary and exploratory outcomes include, among others, child psychiatric symptoms, parental stress and coping with childrens negative emotions. Outcomes and adverse events are assessed before (T0) and after 10 weeks of treatment (T1) and 6 months later (T2). Regression analysis and /or ANOVA will be used for all outcomes. PERSPECTIVES: Targeting the parent-child relation has the potential to reduce psychiatric symptoms in children. This trial will provide valuable information if attachment-based interventions like COS-P can enhance treatment as usual in child mental health services.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the surgical results of 39 patients who underwent surgical repair for postoperative bronchopleural fistula between January 2010 and June 2020. Success of bronchopleural fistula repair was defined as the visual closure of the bronchopleural fistula with the absence of an air leak, a recurrence of bronchopleural fistula and infection in the thoracic cavity. RESULTS: Twenty-five (64.1%) bronchopleural fistulas occurred after pulmonary resection and 14 (35.9%) after lung transplantation. Bronchopleural fistula was diagnosed 19 days (median) and repaired 28 days (median) after the initial operation by primary closure in 27 (69.2%) patients, and by additional resection in 12 (30.8%) patients. The overall success rate was 59% (23/39) and the overall mortality was 56.4% (22/39). Multivariable analysis revealed that the patients who were supported by mechanical ventilation at the time of repair had significantly lower success rates than those without (15.4%, 2/13 vs. 80.8%, 21/26, respectively, p < 0.001). The omental flap group tended to have a better success rate than the muscle flap group (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high overall mortality rate after bronchopleural fistula repair and a low success rate.

In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases. METHOD: We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families. RESULT: Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.","output":"Clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 family clusters in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small reservoirs of different molecules and important mediators of cell-to-cell communication.

The purpose of this study was to report a recent case and perform a systematic literature review. METHODS: Patient data were gathered from chart review and clinical encounters. For the review, the MEDLINE, Embase, and Ovid databases were queried for deltoid compartment syndrome cases. Seventeen articles reporting on 18 patients with deltoid compartment syndrome were included. RESULTS: Including our patient, 9 of 19 patients (47.4%) presented with compartment syndrome limited to the deltoid. Most patients presented with additional affected compartments, most commonly in the ipsilateral arm (7 of 19, 37%). Isolated deltoid involvement often resulted from iatrogenic injury; of 10 iatrogenic reports, 8 involved only the deltoid. Of 19 cases, 5 (26%) occurred in powerlifters, climbers, or anabolic steroid or testosterone injectors. In 13 of 19 cases (68%), the patients were men aged 18-36 years, and only 1 female case (5%) was reported. Prolonged recumbence owing to substance abuse was documented in 6 of 19 cases (32%). CONCLUSION: Deltoid compartment syndrome is rare, with only 19 reported cases, including our patient. Men are more commonly affected, and isolated deltoid compartment syndrome occurs in about 50% of reported cases. More than half of cases are iatrogenic, secondary to prolonged lateral decubitus positioning, injections, and surgical interventions about the shoulder.

To alleviate these problems, healthcare organisations have been providing support for their staff, including organisational, cognitive behavioural and physical and mental relaxation interventions. This paper reports the findings of a study commissioned by a Scottish NHS health board area during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. The study aimed to understand the experience of NHS staff relating to the provision of wellbeing interventions between March and August 2020. METHODS: Data were gathered from free-text comments of eight surveys completed by a wide range of staff across sites within one NHS health board in Scotland. We conducted a framework analysis of the data. RESULTS: Our findings show that despite the provision of relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions to support staff wellbeing during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were barriers to access, including heavy workload, understaffing, inconvenient locations and the stigma of being judged. Organisational factors were the most frequently reported support need amongst frontline staff across sites. CONCLUSIONS: While relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions were well received by staff, barriers to accessing them still existed. Staff support in the context of organisational factors, such as engagement with managers was deemed as the most important for staff wellbeing. Managers play a key role in everyday organisational processes and therefore are in the right position to meet increasing frontline staff demands due to the pandemic and removing barriers to accessing wellbeing support. Healthcare managers should be aware of organisational factors that might increase job demands and protect organisational resources that can promote wellbeing for frontline staff.","output":"Fix the issues at the coalface and mental wellbeing will be improved: a framework analysis of frontline NHS staff experiences and use of health and wellbeing resources in a Scottish health board area during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with migraine. METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3  10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations.

Stenosis progression would lead to increased clinical risk such as heart attack. Although many risk factors were found to contribute to atherosclerosis progression, factors associated with fatigue is underemphasized. Our goal is to investigate the relationship between fatigue and stenosis progression based on in vivo intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images and finite element models. Methods: Baseline and follow-up in vivo IVUS and angiography data were acquired from seven patients using Institutional Review Board approved protocols with informed consent obtained. Three hundred and five paired slices at baseline and follow-up were matched and used for plaque modeling and analysis. IVUS-based thin-slice models were constructed to obtain the coronary biomechanics and stress/strain amplitudes (stress/strain variations in one cardiac cycle) were used as the measurement of fatigue. The change of lumen area (DLA) from baseline to follow-up were calculated to measure stenosis progression. Nineteen morphological and biomechanical factors were extracted from 305 slices at baseline. Correlation analyses of these factors with DLA were performed. Random forest (RF) method was used to fit morphological and biomechanical factors at baseline to predict stenosis progression during follow-up. Results: Significant correlations were found between stenosis progression and maximum stress amplitude, average stress amplitude and average strain amplitude (p < 0.05). After factors selection implemented by random forest (RF) method, eight morphological and biomechanical factors were selected for classification prediction of stenosis progression. Using eight factors including fatigue, the overall classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of stenosis progression prediction with RF method were 83.61%, 86.25% and 80.69%, respectively. Conclusion: Fatigue correlated positively with stenosis progression.

An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of COVID-19 in Italy. On March 16th 2020, we presented a position paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and average concentrations of PM(10) exceeding a daily limit of 50 g/m(3). METHODS: To monitor the spreading of COVID-19 in Italy from February 24th to March 13th (the date of the Italian lockdown), official daily data for PM(10) levels were collected from all Italian provinces between February 9th and February 29th, taking into account the maximum lag period (14 days) between the infection and diagnosis. In addition to the number of exceedances of the daily limit value of PM(10), we also considered population data and daily travelling information for each province. RESULTS: Exceedance of the daily limit value of PM(10) appears to be a significant predictor of infection in univariate analyses (p<0.001). Less polluted provinces had a median of 0.03 infections over 1000 residents, while the most polluted provinces showed a median of 0.26 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian provinces resulted in the category with the highest PM(10) levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern provinces presented low PM(10) concentrations (p<0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than in Rome (0.34 vs 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs 2.6, respectively), thus suggesting a basic reproductive number R(0)>6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.

However, first-in-human studies in solid tumors revealed unique hurdles contributing to poor demonstration of efficacy. Understanding the determinants of tumor recognition by CAR T cells should translate into the design of strategies that can overcome resistance. Here, we show that multiple carcinomas express extracellular N-glycans, whose abundance negatively correlates with CAR T cell killing. By knocking out mannoside acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase 5 (MGAT5) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC), we showed that N-glycans protect tumors from CAR T cell killing by interfering with proper immunological synapse formation and reducing transcriptional activation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity. To overcome this barrier, we exploited the high metabolic demand of tumors to safely inhibit N-glycans synthesis with the glucose/mannose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG). Treatment with 2DG disrupts the N-glycan cover on tumor cells and results in enhanced CAR T cell activity in different xenograft mouse models of PAC. Moreover, 2DG treatment interferes with the PD-1-PD-L1 axis and results in a reduced exhaustion profile of tumor-infiltrating CAR T cells in vivo. The combined 2DG and CAR T cell therapy was successful against multiple carcinomas besides PAC, including those arising from the lung, ovary, and bladder, and with different clinically relevant CAR specificities, such as CD44v6 and CEA.

METHODS: 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (TrocCl) was used in the derivatization of 3Q in three different soils of varying composition and total organic content (Virginia Type A soil, Nebraska EPA standard soil and Ottawa sand) when present at a 10 gg-1 concentration in each. A direct derivatization protocol and one involving the pre-extraction of the analyte were evaluated for their individual efficiencies and subsequent analysis by EI-GC-MS. RESULTS: The practical derivatization of 3Q, when present at low levels (10 gg-1 ) in three different soil matrices was found to be rapid (1 hour) and to smoothly take place at ambient temperature (and as low as 4 o C). The method detection limit (MDL) was determined to be 30 ngmL-1 for the Virginia type A soil, 49 ngmL-1 for the Nebraska EPA standard soil and 72 ngmL-1 for the Ottawa sand sample. CONCLUSIONS: An expedient and practical derivatization method for 3Q, a chemical warfare degradation product difficult to detect by GC-MS, has been accomplished using trichloroethyl chloroformate. The reaction provides 3Q-Troc, a derivative with superior detectability than 3Q by EI-GC-MS such as peak sharpness and a unique mass spectrum for its unambiguous identification.","output":"\\"Trocylation of 3-quinuclidinol, a key marker for the chemical warfare agent BZ, for its enhanced detection at low levels in complex soil matrices by Electron Ionization Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in diversion of healthcare resources to the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale (VELTAS) was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: 1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), 2) Chronic Venous Disease (CVD), 3) Vascular anomalies, 4) Venous trauma 5) Venous compression and 6) Lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included 1) Medical Emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; 2) Urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis ; 3) Semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic CVD, and 4) Discretionary/Non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency. The scale may be used during pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis but may also be used as a general framework to classify urgency of the listed conditions.","output":"Triage of Patients with Venous and Lymphatic Diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic- the Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale (VELTAS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are concerns that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades immune responses due to unusually high numbers of mutations on the spike protein.

This pandemic is the world's third wake-up call this century. In 2003 and 2012, the world experienced two major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing major respiratory tract infections. At present, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for COVID-19. The severe COVID-19 symptoms of hyperinflammation, catastrophic damage to the vascular endothelium, thrombotic complications, septic shock, brain damage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and acute neurological and psychiatric complications are unprecedented. Many COVID-19 deaths result from the aftermath of hyperinflammatory complications, also referred to as the \\"cytokine storm syndrome\\", endotheliitus and blood clotting, all with the potential to cause multiorgan dysfunction. The sphingolipid rheostat plays integral roles in viral replication, activation/modulation of the immune response, and importantly in maintaining vasculature integrity, with sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) and its cognate receptors (SIPRs: G-protein-coupled receptors) being key factors in vascular protection against endotheliitus. Hence, modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), S1P, and the S1P receptor pathway may provide significant beneficial effects towards counteracting the life-threatening, acute, and chronic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review provides a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease, prospective vaccines, and current treatments. We then discuss the evidence supporting the targeting of SphK/S1P and S1P receptors in the repertoire of COVID-19 therapies to control viral replication and alleviate the known and emerging acute and chronic symptoms of COVID-19.

This study was performed to clarify anti-inflammatory effects of anti-diabetic agents on COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Relevant literature was searched on 15 databases up to November 14, 2020 and was updated on April 13, 2021. The pooled ORs along with 95% CIs were calculated to evaluate combined effects. 31 studies with 66,914 patients were included in qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Meta-analysis showed that metformin was associated with a statistically significant lower mortality (pooled OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.50C0.76, p = 0.000) and poor composite outcomes (pooled OR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.71C0.97, p = 0.022) in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Significance of slight lower mortality remained in sulfonylurea/glinides (pooled OR = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.89C0.98, p = 0.004), but of poor composite outcomes was not (pooled OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 0.61C3.60, p = 0.384). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) were associated with statistically non-significant lower mortality (pooled OR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.72C1.26, p = 0.739) or poor composite outcomes (pooled OR = 1.27, 95% CI, 0.91C1.77, p = 0.162) of COVID-19 in diabetic patients.

Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 individuals were prospectively tested by the Basel-S-gene and the WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 together with SARS-CoV-2. Results. Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) positive samples. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 NOPS. Adults were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while children were more likely to test CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%.

Testing in large numbers at laboratories has overwhelmed their resources. Furthermore, the diagnosis report often takes more than a day to be returned. All this adds up to the incapability of our healthcare infrastructure to test all the possibly infected patients. Radiologists across the world have used chest X-rays to detect chest diseases.

The negative impact of school closures on children and young people is increasingly apparent, however. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an infection monitoring program in schools to enable targeted quarantining to replace school closures. The program is currently being implemented in two model schools in Magdeburg, Germany, within the framework of the Study of Coronavirus Outbreak Prevention in Magdeburg Schools (Studie zur Ausbruchsvermeidung von Corona an Magdeburger Schulen [STACAMA]). METHODS: Five pupils per class are pseudorandomly selected twice a week and asked to provide a gargle sample over a 16-week evaluation period. RNA is extracted from each sample individually in a laboratory and pooled according to school class for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis. Immediate individual sample testing will be carried out in the case of a positive pool test. Individual RNA extraction prior to pooling and application of rRT-PCR result in high test sensitivity. Testing will be performed in strict adherence to data protection standards. All participating pupils will receive a 16-digit study code, which they will be able to use to access their test RESULTS: When the study commenced on December 2, 2020, 520 (52%) pupils and their families or guardians had consented to study participation. The study was suspended after four test rounds due to renewed school closures resulting from rising regional infection incidence. Testing resumed when schools reopened on March 8, 2021, at which time consent to participation was provided for 54% of pupils.

Given the modifiable nature of electronic cigarettes and the delivery of high concentrations of nicotine, we investigate whether electronic cigarette vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We exposed BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B) and primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) to electronic cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin or commercially bought e-liquid (added nicotine) and cigarette smoke extract to investigate if electronic cigarette exposure, like cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. In BEAS-2B cells, cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity (LDH), and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24 h treatments in BEAS-2B cells and 4 h in SAECs; ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 4 h treatment in BEAS-2B cells. Nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells. Higher LDH release and reduced membrane integrity were seen in BEAS-2B cells treated for 24 h with higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates. ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to cell controls, particularly for 24 h exposures. ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to the locally bought e-liquid condensate with high nicotine concentration and cigarette smoke extract compared with cell controls. Our study suggests that vaping alone and smoking alone can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression. Vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for COVID-19, which, if avoided, could help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the severity of the disease.

As a response, the LTCI (long-term care insurance) system has been executed among European countries and piloted in 15 cities of China in 2016. Subsequently, the influence and dilemma of LTCI system have become a hot academic topic in the past 20 years. Methods The review was carried out to reveal the effects of the LTCI system on different economic entities by reviewing relevant literature published from January 2008 to September 2019. The quality of 25 quantitative and 24 qualitative articles was evaluated using the JBI and CASP critical evaluation checklist, respectively. Results The review systematically examines the effects of the LTCI system on different microeconomic entities such as caretakers or their families and macroeconomic entities such as government spending. The results show that the LTCI system has a great impact on social welfare. For example, LTCI has a positive effect on the health and life quality of the disabled elderly. However, the role of LTCI in alleviating the financial burden on families with the disabled elderly may be limited. Conclusion Implementation of LTCI system not only in reducing the physical and mental health problems of health care recipients and providers, and the economic burden of their families, but also promote the development of health care service industry and further improvement of the health care system. However, the dilemma and sustainable development of the LTCI system is the government needs to focus on in the future due to the sustainability of its funding sources.","output":"Effect Evaluation of the Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) System on the Health Care of the Elderly: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internationally, mental health service developments are increasingly informed by the principles of recovery, and the availability of arts and creative activities are becoming more common as part of provision. Mental health service users' experiences, reflecting on the complex nature of using music participation in recovery are, however, limited. This essay considers literature that explores how music can support mental health service users in a recovery process. We have selected studies that include a broad spectrum of music activities, as well as literature considering various concepts about recovery. The conceptual recovery framework CHIME, that includes five important components in the recovery process, is used as the backdrop for exploring music activities as a contribution to recovery-oriented practice and services in mental health care. Eleven key components are identified in which music can support the recovery process: Feelings of equality; Social and emotional wellbeing; Tolerance; Hope and social agency; Triggering encounters; Redefining and reframing; A social practice; Moments of flow and peak experiences; Moments of meaning; Continuity; and Potentials instead of limitations. This essay concludes that the experiential knowledge of music activities from service users' perspectives is essential knowledge when developing and using music activities in mental health recovery services. While this essay acknowledges that music activities can also produce unintended negative outcomes, the focus is on the positive contributions of music to mental health recovery processes.","output":"Music Activities and Mental Health Recovery: Service Users' Perspectives Presented in the CHIME Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is the second novel zoonotic disease infecting humans caused by coronavirus (CoV) in this century.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Twenty-nine horses (32 tarsi) with OCF in the PIJ. METHODS Medical records of horses with radiographic evidence of OCF in the PIJ were reviewed. Clinical features, number of fragments, location, arthroscopic appearance, and outcome were recorded. Technical modifications with visual aids specific to this arthroscopic technique are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven horses (93%) had radiographic evidence of osteochondritis dissecans lesions in the tarsocrural joint (TCJ). OCF were most commonly located distal to the medial trochlear ridge of the talus. In all cases, fragments were successfully retrieved with a technique based on exposing the fragments after resection of the proximal intertarsal joint capsule (PIJC). Fragments were visible from the TCJ prior resection of the PIJC in 4 of 32 tarsi. A third portal was created to access fragments located distal to the lateral trochlear ridge in 3 of 32 tarsi. Moderate intra-articular bleeding occurred when the PIJC was resected in 3 of 32 tarsi. One horse had postoperative swelling that resolved with conservative medical management. All horses with long-term follow-up available (16/29) started training or returned to their athletic career. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The arthroscopic technique based on resection of PIJC was effective in retrieving OCF in the PIJ and was associated with minor complications.

The aims of this study were to establish an in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell model (iPSC) of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) from patients with an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma and to examine whether doxorubicin (DOX)-treated ACT-iPSC cardiomyocytes (CM) can recapitulate the clinical features exhibited by patients, and thus help uncover a DOX-dependent pathomechanism. ACT-iPSC CM generated from individuals with CD20+ B-cell lymphoma who had received high doses of DOX and suffered cardiac dysfunction were studied and compared to control-iPSC CM from cancer survivors without cardiac symptoms. In cellular studies, ACT-iPSC CM were persistently more susceptible to DOX toxicity including augmented disorganized myofilament structure, changed mitochondrial shape, and increased apoptotic events. Consistently, ACT-iPSC CM and cardiac fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic human ACT myocardium exhibited higher DOX-dependent reactive oxygen species. In functional studies, Ca2+ transient amplitude of ACT-iPSC CM was reduced compared to control cells, and diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak was DOX-dependently increased. This could be explained by overactive CaMKII in ACT CM. Together with DOX-dependent augmented proarrhythmic cellular triggers and prolonged action potentials in ACT CM, this suggests a cellular link to arrhythmogenic events and contractile dysfunction especially found in ACT engineered human myocardium. CamKII inhibition prevented proarrhythmic triggers in ACT. In contrast, control CM upregulated SERCA2a expression in a DOX-dependent manner, possibly to avoid heart failure conditions. In conclusion, we developed the first human patient-specific stem cell model of DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction from patients with B-cell lymphoma. Our results suggest that DOX-induced stress resulted in arrhythmogenic events associated with contractile dysfunction and finally in heart failure after persistent stress activation in ACT patients.","output":"Doxorubicin induces cardiotoxicity in a pluripotent stem cell model of aggressive B cell lymphoma cancer patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensive disinfection of wastewater during the COVID-19 pandemic might elevate the generation of toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which has triggered global concerns about their ecological risks to natural aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the toxicity of 17 DBPs typically present in wastewater effluents on three representative microalgae, including Scenedesmus sp. (Chlorophyta), Microcystis aeruginosa (Cyanophyta), and Cyclotella sp. (Bacillariophyta) was investigated. The sensitivities of the three microalgae to DBPs varied greatly from species to species, indicating that DBPs may change the structure of phytoplankton communities. Later, co-cultures of these phytoplankton groups as a proxy of ecological freshwater scenario were conducted to explore the impacts of DBPs on phytoplankton community succession. M. aeruginosa became surprisingly dominant in co-cultures, representing over 50% after dosing with monochloroacetic acid (MCAA, 0.1-10 mg/L). The highest proportion of M. aeruginosa was 70.3% when exposed to 2 mg/L MCAA. Although Scenedesmus sp. dominated in monochloroacetonitrile (MCAN) exposure, M. aeruginosa accounted for no less than 30% even at 40 mg/L MCAN.

Guidelines recommend multi-modal, non-pharmacological interventions. The Fibromyalgia Active Management and Exercise (FAME) programme was developed by a multidisciplinary team, at King's College Hospital. The Programme, informed by evidence and clinical guidelines, aimed to improve function and quality of life by facilitating self-management and increasing physical activity. It consisted of 12, two hour weekly face-to-face group sessions delivered by a multidisciplinary team (physiotherapists, pain nurses, psychologist) and incorporated education, exercise, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and mindfulness approaches. This qualitative service evaluation aimed to assess the acceptability of FAME from the perspective of both the patients and healthcare practitioners (HCP) and identity refinements to the programme. Methods: All patients and HCP involved in the first FAME programme were invited to attend either a focus group (1 patient, 1 HCP group) or 1:1 semi-structured interviews. Topic guides were developed a priori and informed by previous literature and the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA, seven constructs (Affective Attitude;Burden;Ethicality;Intervention Coherence;Opportunity Costs;Perceived Effectiveness;Self-efficacy)). Interviews and focus groups were conducted by one of three researchers, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results: Sixteen participants (six HCP (three physiotherapists, two nurses, one psychologist) and seven patients (mean age 46 (7.5) years, all female, mean duration of symptoms 12 (4.9) years) were enrolled. Focus groups were 60 min and interviews were 30 min duration. FAME was broadly acceptable to HCP participants but not to all patient participants. Some patient participants reported that FAME did not meet their expectations or address areas of importance to them. Five themes that could be explained by four of the TFA constructs were identified: role of social support (self-efficacy), FAME as a learning opportunity (perceived effectiveness), fit for FAME (affective attitude), understanding FAME (intervention coherence) and a journey towards self-management (perceived effectiveness). Both patient and HCP participants expressed that social support was important and influenced their experience of FAME. Patient participants perceived that support from peers facilitated their attendance at FAME and adherence to the recommended exercise programme. Learning from the experience of their peers and mindfulness training were their favoured elements of the programme. Conclusion(s): FAME is a new bespoke management programme for people with fibromyalgia. It was acceptable for HCPs but further adaptation was required to optimise acceptability for patients. Refinements made to FAME included: establishing an introductory session and active opt-in requirement, a booklet rather than handouts, inclusion of an expert patient, and adaptation for online delivery due to COVID-19. Strengths of the project included the recruitment of both patients and HCPS and use of the TFA to inform the study. However, only regular attenders engaged although all patients were invited. Future work should therefore incorporate their views. Impact: Working with patient and HCP during the development of interventions is essential to optimise acceptability, and this may influence fidelity and feasibility of the new programme. For patients and HCP social support is the most important element in programmes for fibromyalgia. Thus, social support must be prioritised when transforming services.

Stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) may improve the therapeutic ratio using reoptimization to account for daily variation in target and OAR anatomy. This study assessed the feasibility of UCT SMART and characterized dosimetric and clinical outcomes in patients treated for UCT lesions on a prospective phase 1 trial. Methods and Materials Five patients with oligometastatic (n = 4) or unresectable primary (n = 1) UCT malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy in 5 fractions with goal 95% planning target volume (PTV) coverage by 95% of prescription, subject to strict OAR constraints. Daily real-time online adaptive plans were created as needed to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both, based on daily setup MR image set anatomy. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons were prospectively recorded. Results All initial and daily adaptive plans met strict OAR constraints based on simulation and daily setup MR imaging anatomy, respectively. Four of the 5 patients received 1 adapted fraction. Ten of the 25 total delivered fractions were adapted. A total of 30% of plan adaptations were performed to improve PTV coverage; 70% were for reversal of 1 OAR violation. Local control by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was 100% at 3 and 6 months. No grade 3 acute (within 6 months of radiation completion) treatment-related toxicities were identified. Conclusions SMART may allow PTV coverage improvement and/or OAR sparing compared with nonadaptive SBRT and may widen the therapeutic index of UCT SBRT. In this small prospective cohort, we found that SMART was clinically deliverable to 100% of patients, although treatment delivery times surpassed our predefined, timing-based feasibility endpoint.

To increase the translational reliance, we put forward a G?ttingen minipig model. The animal was stereotactically irradiated at the level of the visual cortex upon defining the target by a fused cerebral MRI and CT scan. A fully implantable neural telemetry system consisting of a 64 channel intracortical multielectrode array, a telemetry capsule, and an inductive rechargeable battery was then implanted into the visual cortex to record and manipulate local field potentials, and multi-unit activity. We achieved a 3-month stability of the functionality of the un-tethered BCI in terms of telemetric radio-communication, inductive battery charging, and device biocompatibility for 3 months. Finally, we could reliably record the local signature of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activity in the visual cortex with high bandwidth without complications. The ability to wireless induction charging combined with the entirely implantable design, the rather high recording bandwidth, and the ability to record and stimulate simultaneously put forward a wireless BCI capable of long-term un-tethered real-time communication for causal preclinical circuit-based closed-loop interventions.","output":"An Intracortical Implantable Brain-Computer Interface for Telemetric Real-Time Recording and Manipulation of Neuronal Circuits for Closed-Loop Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, public education has been forced to hold classes online, which increases the time students are on the internet at home.

In this study, we used a fixed effect model and provincial data to document how public health varies with the business cycle in China over the period of 2010C2019. The estimated results showed that the business cycle is negatively correlated with the mortality of infectious disease, a proxy variable of public health, thus indicating that public health exhibits a countercyclical pattern in China. Furthermore, we investigated the potential moderating role of public health education and digital economy development in the relationship between business cycle and public health. Our findings suggested that public health education and digital economy development can mitigate the damage of economic conditions on public health in China. Health education helps the public obtain more professional knowledge about diseases and then induces effective preventions. Compared with traditional economic growth, digital economy development can avoid environmental pollution which affects public health. Also, it ensures that state-of-the-art medical services are available for the public through e-health. In addition, digitalization assures that remote working is practicable and reduces close contact during epidemics such as COVID-19. The conclusions stand when subjected to several endogeneity and robustness checks.

To study its subcellular localization, ORF of protein  with 338 aa was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and was detected in transfected cells in the absence of other viral proteins. In both SB and Cos-7 cells, protein  was found to localize EGFP to the nucleolus and cytoplasm. Deletion mutants of protein  indicated that N-terminal 43 amino acid residues were required to import EGFP- protein into the nucleolus.

At the present, there exists no specific therapy for HEV. The natural compound silvestrol has a potent antiviral effect against the (?)-strand RNA-virus Ebola virus, and also against the (+)-strand RNA viruses Corona-, Picorna-, and Zika virus. The inhibitory effect on virus spread is due to an inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, which is required to unwind structured 5-untranslated regions (UTRs). This leads to an impaired translation of viral RNA. The HEV (+)-strand RNA genome contains a 5-capped, short 5-UTR. This study aims to analyze the impact of silvestrol on the HEV life cycle. Persistently infected A549 cells were instrumental. This study identifies silvestrol as a potent inhibitor of the release of HEV infectious viral particles. This goes along with a strongly reduced HEV capsid protein translation, retention of viral RNA inside the cytoplasm, and without major cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, in parallel silvestrol affects the activity of the antiviral major vault protein (MVP) by translocation from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear membrane.

Researches in economics and finance have long recognized the importance of policy uncertainty. However, most studies take policy uncertainty as a given while focusing on its real or financial influences. The few studies exploring the economic sources of policy uncertainty often attribute it to some sort of external uncertainty faced by the government in making policies. The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 tells a different story. Its influence on the stock market is unpreceded (Baker et al. 2020, Fetzer et al. 2020). Conditioning on the same uncertainty of the pandemic, however, governments across the world formulate and announce different policies. The drastically different real and financial impacts of such policies remind us that policy uncertainty could directly originate from the decision process of policymakers.

Phagocytosing human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (hPMN) undergo accelerated apoptosis, a process referred to as phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD) and an early step in their clearance from inflammatory sites. Among human pathogens that modulate hPMN apoptosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae delays PICD, which may contribute to the exuberant neutrophilic inflammation that characterizes gonorrhea. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed PICD, we compared features of hPMN cell death that followed phagocytosis of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild-type (GC) or serum-opsonized zymosan (OPZ), a prototypical stimulus of PICD. Phosphatidylserine externalization required NADPH oxidase activity after ingestion of GC or OPZ, and annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation were less after phagocytosis of GC compared to OPZ. Caspase 3/7 and caspase 9 activities after phagocytosis of GC were less than that seen after ingestion of OPZ, but caspase 8 activity was the same after ingestion of GC or OPZ. When hPMN sequentially ingested GC followed by OPZ, both caspase 3/7 and 9 activities were less than that seen after OPZ alone, and the inhibition was dose dependent for GC, suggesting that ingestion of GC actively inhibited PICD. Sequential phagocytosis did not block caspase 8 activity, mitochondrial depolarization, or annexin V/propidium iodide staining compared to responses of hPMN fed OPZ alone, despite inhibition of caspases 3/7 and 9. Taken together, these data suggest that active inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis contributes to the delay in PICD after hPMN ingestion of N. gonorrhoeae.","output":"Modulation of phagocytosis-induced cell death of human neutrophils by Neisseria gonorrhoeae."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the findings of a study in 11 cities across five geographic regions on the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on different groups of informal workers and their households.

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue Influenza A+B RDT in an at-home setting. A convenience sample of 5,229 individuals who were engaged with an on-line health research platform were prospectively recruited throughout the United States. Flu@home test kits containing a QuickVue RDT and reference sample collection and shipping materials were prepositioned with participants at the beginning of the study. Participants responded to daily symptom surveys. If they reported experiencing cough along with aches, fever, chills, and/or sweats, they used their flu@home kit following instructions on a mobile app and indicated what lines they saw on the RDT.

It is a significant global issue and India is one of the most affected countries. Religious mass gatherings congregate millions of pilgrims at one place. Over-crowding is a high-risk factor for the transmission of tuberculosis. Knowledge and awareness of the disease are proven prerequisites for the spread-prevention and early diagnosis of tuberculosis. The present study was designed to explore the knowledge of tuberculosis and awareness of disease transmission risk among pilgrims attending a religious mass gathering, the Kumbh Mela (2016) in Ujjain, India. METHODS: Self-reported data on the pilgrims tuberculosis-knowledge were collected using a cross-sectional study design. A contextual, pre-tested questionnaire was used, using the convenience sampling method. In addition to the anonymous descriptive analyses, a composite knowledge-score was developed to enable comparisons between demographic groups. RESULTS: In total, 1665 pilgrims participated in the study with 38.8 years of mean age and 59% literacy rate. The most recognized symptoms of tuberculosis were Cough for more than 15 days with sputum (94%) and Blood in sputum (81%). Most participants knew that tuberculosis is an infectious disease (93%) and not hereditary (91%). Additionally, 84% considered it is a potentially lethal disease that requires extensive treatment. However, vaccine awareness was poor (4%). Direct contact with tuberculosis patient (78%) and To be in a crowded area (4%) were considered as the most important risk factors for tuberculosis transmission. For the composite knowledge-score, a significantly higher mean score was seen among those with at least ten years of schooling compared with illiterates (p < 0.001). Occupation and residency also affected the mean score. CONCLUSION: Most pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela had basic knowledge of the characteristics of tuberculosis, but some important knowledge gaps concerning the transmission risks associated with crowded situations existed. These gaps need to be addressed in future policies to enable safer mass gatherings and to end the TB epidemic, globally.","output":"Knowledge and transmission risk awareness of tuberculosis among the pilgrims attending a religious mass gathering in India: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To ensure efficient virus replication, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes several viral proteins to counter host defense response upon infection. Among these proteins, the multifunctional viral protein 34.5 crucially interferes with or disrupts several antiviral pathways at multiple levels. The current study shows that 34.5 utilizes nucleolar protein NOP53 to facilitate the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 for efficient viral translation. Our study shows that: (1) ectopic expression of NOP53 greatly increases the intracellular and extracellular viral yields of HSV-1 (wild strain F) in type I interferon-deficient Vero cells, and more subtly promotes viral replication of 34.5 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/34.5. (2) NOP53 is migrated from nuclei in HSV-1/F infected cells, but is redistributed incompletely after infection by either HSV-1/34.5 or ICP4 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/d120 (replication inadequate). Ectopic expression of 34.5, consequently, induces cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53 in response to HSV-1/34.5 infection. (3) Increase of NOP53, in two forms of transient transfection and in vitro expression, attenuates the phosphorylation level of eIF2 in HSV-1/F infected cells, but fails to affect eIF2 phosphorylation induced by HSV-1/34.5 infection. (4) Knockdown of NOP53, which impairs the specific interaction between 34.5 and protein phosphatase PP1, disrupts the ability of 34.5 to maintain HSV-1 virulence. (5) NOP53 knockdown also significantly reduces tissue damage and decreases viral yield in livers of HSV-1 infected mice. Our findings expand the understanding of the underlying mechanism by which viral protein 34.5 induces NOP53 redistribution; cytoplasmic NOP53 facilitates 34.5 recruitment of PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2, for optimal viral replication. This paper also demonstrates that blocking the specific interaction between 34.5 and PP1 would be a useful approach for the development of antiviral agents.","output":"Multifunctional viral protein 34.5 manipulates nucleolar protein NOP53 for optimal viral replication of HSV-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical resection of congenital lung lesions has evolved with minimally invasive and parenchyma-preserving techniques.

However, knowledge on the relationship between long-term maintained healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still sparse. We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9,677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5,194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5,194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (3 < MDS &#8804; 6) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34-0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS > 6) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS &#8804; 3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06).

Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Although the prevalence is unknown, >600 cases have been reported in the literature. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia, and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present as vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Empirical treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and other immunomodulatory agents have been used frequently.

However, many individuals who should receive genetic counseling are never offered this service.

A quality improvement project to actively identify and offer genetic counseling to all women with early onset, triple negative and metastatic breast cancer was implemented. Baseline information on the number of early onset (<=45), triple negative and metastatic HER2 negative breast cancers diagnosed January 2018-June 2019 was collected and cross-referenced with the Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment patient database and the electronic health record (EHR) to see how many had GC/GT in our department or the breast surgeons' office. We developed questions for an electronic screening tool used by the navigation team when meeting with patients for the first time, screening for personal or family history criteria that would flag patients at increased risk for hereditary cancer. If any questions were flagged, the patient was asked by the navigator if they would be interested in a genetic counseling appointment to consider genetic Stesting. Training was provided to the navigation team so that they could answer basic questions, biweekly meetings were set up to discuss patients, and a flier and informational videos were made available to patients who wanted more information about GC/GT. If a patient was agreeable to genetic counseling, an automated email was triggered to the genetics team, who contacted the patient for an appointment. A standing order was obtained from willing breast surgeons and oncologists within our network to streamline the referral process. In the 18-month baseline period, there were 126 patients diagnosed with early onset, 36 with triple negative <=60 and 30 with metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer. Of these, 57.1% of early onset, 66.7% triple negative and 3.3% of those with metastatic breast cancer had documentation of GC/GT. A paper screening tool was implemented in July 2019 with implementation of an electronic version in November 2019. In the 18-month intervention period, there were 100 patients diagnosed with early onset, 39 with triple negative and 22 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Of these, 86% of early onset, 87.2% of triple negative and 31.8% of metastatic breast cancer patients had documented GC/GT.A limitation of this project is that some patients leave the system to be treated elsewhere after diagnosis and some may have been tested in their private practitioner's office that does not connect with our EHR. Additionally, some may have been offered GC/GT but declined or were unwilling/unable to complete an appointment. Finally, the pandemic likely had an impact on this project, since fewer women were undergoing mammography screening due to COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in fewer diagnoses of breast cancer.

We hope to raise awareness of these issues and consequently improve outcomes for women with serious mental illness. RECENT FINDINGS SMI have different rates and are manifested differently in women and men because of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors. Some SMI are more prevalent in women whereas others uniquely affect them during particular life stages. Even in disorders that have a similar prevalence in men and women or are more prevalent in men, the presentation, course, management, and repercussions can vary significantly between the two genders. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities, which directly influence treatment, prognosis, and disability, are more common in women. SUMMARY Several differences in the gender expression of SMI have not yet been fully described. It is important to become familiar with important characteristics of SMI in women, including biological determinants, treatment differences, and psychosocial aspects.

This immune response model, when combined with a transmission model, reproduces the previously reported shift in the population distribution of viral loads along an epidemic trajectory.","output":"Compositional modelling of immune response and virus transmission dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving chemotherapy or biological therapies, patients with haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or HIV infection, and recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants. The type and degree of the immune defect dictate the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell-mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus, respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects, and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. Importantly, conventional non-opportunistic pathogens are frequently encountered in immunocompromised hosts and should not be overlooked. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by computed tomography) and speed of onset help to identify the likely pathogen(s); radiological imaging can subsequently be supported by targeted investigation including the early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients. Rapid and expert clinical assessment can identify the most likely pathogens, which can then be treated aggressively, providing the best opportunity for a positive clinical outcome.","output":"Opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To discuss the challenges of conducting a death by neurologic criteria or brain death evaluation in the coronavirus disease 2019 era and provide guidance to mitigate viral transmission risk and maintain patient safety during testing. DESIGN: Not applicable. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENTS: Children with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 who suffer catastrophic brain injury due to one of numerous neurologic complications or from an unrelated process and require evaluation for death by neurologic criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There is a risk to healthcare providers from aerosol generation during the neurologic examination and apnea test for determination of death by neurologic criteria. In this technical note, we provide guidance to mitigate transmission risk and maintain patient safety during each step of the death by neurologic criteria evaluation. Clinicians should put on appropriate personal protective equipment before performing the death by neurologic criteria evaluation. Risk of aerosol generation and viral transmission during the apnea test can be mitigated by using continuous positive airway pressure delivered via the ventilator as a means of apneic oxygenation. Physicians should assess the risk of transporting coronavirus disease 2019 patients to the nuclear medicine suite to perform a radionucleotide cerebral blood flow study, as disconnections to and from the ventilator for transport and inadvertent ventilator disconnections during transport can increase transmission risk. CONCLUSIONS: When conducting the neurologic examination and apnea test required for death by neurologic criteria determination in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, appropriate modifications are needed to mitigate the risk of viral transmission and ensure patient safety.","output":"Brain Death Evaluation in Children With Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generation intervals and serial intervals are critical quantities for characterizing outbreak dynamics. Generation intervals characterize the time between infection and transmission, while serial intervals characterize the time between the onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission. They are often used interchangeably, leading to misunderstanding of how these intervals link the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number R. Generation intervals provide a mechanistic link between r and R but are harder to measure via contact tracing. While serial intervals are easier to measure from contact tracing, recent studies suggest that the two intervals give different estimates of R from r. We present a general framework for characterizing epidemiological delays based on cohorts (i.e., a group of individuals that share the same event time, such as symptom onset) and show that forward-looking serial intervals, which correctly link R with r, are not the same as \\"intrinsic\\" serial intervals, but instead change with r. We provide a heuristic method for addressing potential biases that can arise from not accounting for changes in serial intervals across cohorts and apply the method to estimating R for the COVID-19 outbreak in China using serial-interval data --- our analysis shows that using incorrectly defined serial intervals can severely bias estimates. This study demonstrates the importance of early epidemiological investigation through contact tracing and provides a rationale for reassessing generation intervals, serial intervals, and R estimates, for COVID-19.","output":"Cohort-based approach to understanding the roles of generation and serial intervals in shaping epidemiological dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of prostate cancer (PCa) is increasing.

Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in our thinking towards telehealth solutions, primarily to avoid or limit physical contact and to spare resources. Here we report our novel telehealth solution for PCa follow-up, called Mobile PSA. Currently, more than 4500 PCa patients have been using Mobile PSA follow-up in our center. Mobile PSA can increase follow-up accuracy, as all biochemical relapses will be detected in a timely manner, can significantly reduce delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen results to patients, and can significantly reduce costs.

We extend the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with a time-varying, country-specific distancing term, and derive the Model-Inferred DIStancing index (MIDIS) for 120 countries using readily available epidemiological data. The index is not sensitive to measurement errors in epidemiological data and to the values assigned to model parameters. The evolution of MIDIS shows that countries exhibit diverse patterns of distancing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemica persistent increase, a trendless fluctuation, and an inverted U are among these patterns. We then implement regression analyses using MIDIS and obtain the following results: First, MIDIS is strongly correlated with available mobility statistics, at least for high income countries. Second, MIDIS is also strongly associated with (i) the stringency of lockdown measures (governmental response), (ii) the cumulative number of deceased persons (behavioral response), and (iii) the time that passed since the first confirmed case (temporal response). Third, there is statistically significant regional variation in MIDIS, and more developed societies achieve higher distancing levels.

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2C3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","output":"A quantitative model used to compare within-host SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV dynamics provides insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recent overdose trends are characterized by increased toxicological detection of stimulants with opioids, yet it is unclear whether these substances are mixed prior to consumption or purposefully used simultaneously.

Substances found by death scene investigators at the scene of the fatal overdose (57 samples) were tested using high-pressure liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. We compared toxicology and LC-MS results to understand whether substances contributing to overdose were found in combination or separately at the scene of the overdose. RESULTS Comparing toxicology reports with LC-MS results from substances found at the scene of overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants reveal that deaths are largely the result of the co-use of opioids and stimulants, rather than use of stimulants combined with opioids.

According to the final outcome, the patients were divided into survivor group and death group with 10 patients each. The demographic data, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory findings, treatment measures and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes between the two groups. Univariate logistic analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS The mean age of patients with confirmed COVID-19 was 70  12 years, and 40% of them were male. The patients were admitted to ICU 11  9 days after symptom onset. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (19 cases), fatigue or myalgia (18 cases), fever (17 cases) and dyspnea (16 cases). Eleven (55%) of the patients had underlying diseases, among which hypertension was the most common (11 cases), followed by cardiovascular disease (4 cases) and diabetes (3 cases). Six (30%) of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and continued renal replacement therapy but eventually died. Acute cardiac injury was the most common complication (19 cases). Half of the patients died between the 2nd and 19th day after ICU admission.

Inequality in access to urban greenspaces was apparent at global scales. Consequently, many people took to streets for outdoor activities due to its easy accessibility. We, therefore, aimed to study the usage and relevance of streetscapes for outdoor activities during a crisis.

RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Downs syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinsons disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination.","output":"Risk prediction of covid-19 related death and hospital admission in adults after covid-19 vaccination: national prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To overview the rise of virtual tools to propagate academia and clinical service within Africa, in the field of otolaryngology, propelled by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

In this study, a risk model was developed for predicting rehabilitation duration (the time from hospital admission to discharge) of the mild-moderate COVID-19 cases and was used to conduct refined risk management for different risk populations. METHODS: A total of 90 consecutive patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 were enrolled. Large-scale datasets were extracted from clinical practices. Through the multivariable linear regression analysis, the model was based on significant risk factors and was developed for predicting the rehabilitation duration of mild-moderate cases of COVID-19. To assess the local epidemic situation, risk management was conducted by weighing the risk of populations at different risk. RESULTS: Ten risk factors from 44 high-dimensional clinical datasets were significantly correlated to rehabilitation duration (P < 0.05). Among these factors, 5 risk predictors were incorporated into a risk model. Individual rehabilitation durations were effectively calculated. Weighing the local epidemic situation, threshold probability was classified for low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Using this classification, risk management was based on a treatment flowchart tailored for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed novel model is a useful tool for individualized risk management of mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, and it may readily facilitate dynamic clinical decision-making for different risk populations.","output":"Prediction of the Rehabilitation Duration and Risk Management for Mild-Moderate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the current study was to investigate the intersecting roles of dysfunctional personality traits and coping styles in relation to psychological distress during the Italian national lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Participants included 633 adults who completed questionnaires of maladaptive personality traits, coping styles, and psychological distress Results indicated that all the maladaptive traits were associated with psychological distress with magnitude of associations strongest for Negative Affect and weakest for Antagonism Maladaptive traits were also generally positively associated with avoidant/maladaptive and negatively associated with acceptance and positive reframing, forms of coping A series of path analyses further demonstrated that coping strategies partially explained associations between maladaptive personality traits and psychological distress All told, results suggest that during an unprecedented stressful time, associations between maladaptive personality traits and psychological distress may be, at least in part, explained by maladaptive coping strategies","output":"Facing distress in Coronavirus era: The role of maladaptive personality traits and coping strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the issue of the need for an innovative policy in the area of health protection at the link with the transformation of the social and economic development of the country through the pandemic COVID-19 The main goal of this study is to predict two scenarios for the development of the main indicators of the country's socio-economic development: considering the pandemic COVID-19 and the possible course of events without the influence of epidemiological threats The systematization of literary sources and approaches to innovation and the determination of the volume of negative consequences for the national economy, due to the introduction of quarantine restrictions, has shown that this issue is quite relevant around the world The study of the transformation of the trajectory of economic development of Ukraine in the article was carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) collection of statistical information, including 118 indicators of social development, the state of capital investment and business expectations of Ukrainian enterprises and screening of multicollinear indicators among them;2) performing a time series decomposition separately for the interval 5 years before quarantine and taking into account the impact of the pandemic;3) forecasting the consequences of the pandemic according to the investigated indicators of economic development in 2020-2022 by turning the time series into the Fourier series The methodological tools of the study were methods of checking for multicollinearity by Pearson coefficients, decomposition of additive models into trend and cyclic components, selection of cyclic oscillations by fast Fourier transform, extrapolation of constructed models for subsequent years and quality control of constructed models by F-test quarterly data for 2015-2020 are selected The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that among the socio-economic development factors studied, most experienced significant transformations due to the introduction of quarantine restrictions by the government This leads to the need for innovation policy in the health sector in order to minimize such consequences in the future","output":"Innovations in Government Management of the Healthcare System: Forecasting of Covid-19 Consequences in Social Investment and Business Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic epidemiology has proven successful for real-time and retrospective monitoring of small and large-scale outbreaks.

The clinical presentation of HLH can have considerable overlap with other inflammatory conditions. We present a cohort of patients with therapy refractory HLH referred to our center who were found to have a simultaneous presentation of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Twenty-three patients had therapy refractory HLH (13 primary, 4 EVB-HLH, 6 HLH without known trigger). Sixteen (69.6%) met high-risk TMA criteria. Renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, severe hypertension, serositis, and gastrointestinal bleeding were documented only in patients with HLH who had concomitant complement-mediated TMA. Patients with HLH and without TMA required ventilator support mainly due to CNS symptoms, while those with HLH and TMA had respiratory failure predominantly associated with pulmonary hypertension, a known presentation of pulmonary TMA. Ten patients received eculizumab for complement-mediated TMA management while being treated for HLH. All patients who received the complement blocker eculizumab in addition to the interferon gamma blocker emapalumab had complete resolution of their TMA and survived. Our observations suggest co-activation of both interferon and complement pathways as a potential culprit in the evolution of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with inflammatory disorders like refractory HLH and may offer novel therapeutic approaches for these critically ill patients. TMA should be considered in children with HLH and multi-organ failure, as an early institution of a brief course of complement blocking therapy in addition to HLH-targeted therapy may improve clinical outcomes in these patients.

Weekly trends of ED visits, hospitalizations, in- and out-of-hospital, all-cause and cause-specific mortality between December 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2020, were compared with those of the same period of the previous year, using Joinpoint regression models and incidence rate ratios. ResultsNon-COVID-19 ED visits and hospitalizations showed a stable trend until the first Italian case of COVID-19 has been recorded, on February 19th, 2020, when they dropped simultaneously.

A data set of 60,256 Koreans aged  15 years between 2009 and 2017 was used to obtain information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, family history characteristics, MetS, food intake survey, and serum heavy metals. Daily intake of vitamins was measured by a one-day 24 h recall, and curry consumption was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Serum heavy metal levels were quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and using a mercury analyzer. We found that vitamin B1, B2, B3, C, and A intakes were significantly lower in subjects with than without MetS. In contrast, serum levels of Pb, Hg, Cd, vitamin A, E, and hs-CRP were significantly higher in subjects with MetS. The risk of MetS was significantly lower for high curry consumers than low curry consumers (adjusted odds ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.74C0.98).

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction.

The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment. This analysis also demonstrates that birds, non-avian archosauromorphs, and lepidosaurs possess significantly different canal morphologies, and represents the first morphometric analysis of semicircular canals across Diapsida.","output":"The internal cranial anatomy of Champsosaurus (Choristodera: Champsosauridae): Implications for neurosensory function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the global impact of COVID-19, studies comparing the effects of COVID-19 on population mental health across countries are sparse.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (&#8805;18 years) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Mental health (anxiety, depression, resilient coping, hope) and other study data were collected between June-August 2020. Of the 13,263 participants, 62.8% were female and 51.7% were 18-34 years old. Participants living in Brazil had the highest anxiety and depression symptoms while participants living in Singapore had the lowest. Greater personal COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but country-level COVID-19 factors were not. Higher levels of hope were associated with reduced anxiety and depression; higher levels of resilient coping were associated with reduced anxiety but not depression. Substantial variations exist in anxiety and depression symptoms across countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, with personal COVID-19 exposure being a significant risk factor.

In this article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and safety of chloroquine that should be considered in light of use in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as loading doses in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were < 2.5 mol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.

Accordingly, there have been increasing calls for a broader conceptualisation of wellbeing. Here we impose an interpretative framework on previously published literature and theory, and present a theoretical framework that brings into focus the multifaceted determinants of wellbeing and their interactions across multiple domains and levels of scale. We define wellbeing as positive psychological experience, promoted by connections to self, community and environment, supported by healthy vagal function, all of which are impacted by socio-contextual factors that lie beyond the control of the individual. By emphasising the factors within and beyond the control of the individual and highlighting how vagal function both affects and are impacted by key domains, the biopsychosocial underpinnings of wellbeing are explicitly linked to a broader context that is consistent with, yet complementary to, multi-levelled ecological systems theory. Reflecting on the reciprocal relationships between multiple domains, levels of scale and related social contextual factors known to impact on wellbeing, our GENIAL framework may provide a foundation for a transdisciplinary science of wellbeing that has the potential to promote the wellbeing of individuals while also playing a key role in tackling major societal challenges.","output":"Moving Beyond Disciplinary Silos Towards a Transdisciplinary Model of Wellbeing: An Invited Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to combat the COVID-19 crisis brought mountains of legislation and guidance to coerce or encourage people to stay at home and reduce the spread of the virus.

The regulations and guidance assumed that households were separate units and ignored the interdependencies which exist between households and between individuals and wider society. The continuing focus in the lockdown regulations has been on households as autonomous, safe, adequate and secure.

(2) Methods: Visual examinations of daily increases in confirmed COVID-19 cases in 124 countries, determined first and second waves in 28 countries. (3) Results: The first wave spread rate increases with country mean elevation, median population age, time since wave onset, and decreases with temperature. Spread rates decrease above 1000 m, indicating high ultraviolet lights (UVs) decrease the spread rate. The second wave associations are the opposite, i.e., spread increases with temperature and young age, and decreases with time since wave onset. The earliest second waves started 5C7 April at mutagenic high elevations (Armenia, Algeria). The second waves also occurred at the warm-to-cold season transition (Argentina, Chile). Second vs. first wave spread decreases in most (77%) countries. In countries with late first wave onset, spread rates better fit second than first wave-temperature patterns. In countries with ageing populations (for example, Japan, Sweden, and Ukraine), second waves only adapted to spread at higher temperatures, not to infect the young. (4) Conclusions: First wave viruses evolved towards lower spread. Second wave mutant COVID-19 strain(s) adapted to higher temperature, infecting younger ages and replacing (also in cold conditions) first wave COVID-19 strains.

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D-dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started.

In this ubiquitous process, an original entity, challenged by an ever-changing environment, creates variants that evolve into novel entities. Analyzing functions that are essential during stationary-state life yield examples of entities that may be antifragile.

Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. METHODS: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. RESULTS: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a do no harm approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making.

Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed.","output":"Vimentin as a Multifaceted Player and Potential Therapeutic Target in Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The media effect is expected to deliver appropriate information to the people, allowing them to prepare some provisions for the spread of a disease in advance.

Methods: Cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted from 26 March through 1 April 2020 among stroke care providers, focused on reorganisation of health services, the delivery of acute and post-acute stroke care and the availability of personal protective equipment. Results: A total of 426 stroke care providers from 55 countries completed the survey, most of whom worked in Europe (n = 375, 88%) and were stroke physicians/neurologists (n = 334, 78%). Among European respondents, 289 (77%) reported that not all stroke patients were receiving the usual care in their centres and 266 (71%) estimated that functional outcomes and recurrence rates of stroke patients would be negatively affected by the organisational changes caused by the pandemic.

Methods: This observational study enrolled all patients confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU in our center. We offered tocilizumab to all non-septic patients if they did not present any contraindications. Results: We enrolled 68 ICU patients in our center on 72 occasions during the enrollment period; we excluded four patients due to study criteria. The one-year mortality hazard ratio of treated patients was 0.64, with a confidence interval of 0.31 to 1.19, with p = 0.169.

The first-wave virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from first-wave infections. However, the 501Y.V2 variant was poorly cross-neutralized by plasma from individuals with first-wave infections; the efficacy was reduced by 15.1-fold relative to neutralization of 501Y.V2 by plasma from individuals infected in the second wave.

The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters.

The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting SHS. RESULTS: In this study, 17,078 questionnaires were delivered with 16,820 effective questionnaires collected, and 10,715 subjects (63.7%) were found with SHS, with moderate SHS primarily. Physiological sub-scale scored the highest, followed by psychological and social sub-scales. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that man, only-child, workers and farmers were risk factors of SHS. Protective factors of SHS included living in rural areas and townships, laid-off retirees and education degree. CONCLUSION: It shows many people in China place in a poor health status during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary that relevant departments pay more attention to people with poor health such as men, only-child, urban people, workers and farmers, and groups with high education degree during and after pandemic stabilization.","output":"Sub-Health Status Survey and Influential Factor Analysis in Chinese during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150,000/mm(3) for adults. There is still controversy about whether individuals with platelet counts of 100,000/mm(3) to 150,000/mm(3) should be classified as having genuine thrombocytopenia or borderline thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is considered mild when the platelet count is between 70,000 and 150,000/mm(3) and severe if the count is less than 20,000/mm(3). Thrombocytopenia in rheumatoid arthritis is a rare complication, with an incidence estimated between 3 and 10%. The main etiological aspects include drug-induced thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The most common hematological abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection are lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. It has been observed that the severity of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of the infection, being a poor prognosis indicator and a risk factor for mortality. COVID-19 can stimulate the immune system to destroy platelets by increasing the production of autoantibodies and immune complexes. Autoimmunity induced by viral infections can be related to molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen expression and also spreading of the epitope. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of great importance to include the SARS-CoV-2 infection in differential diagnoses, due to the increased variability in forms of presentation of this pathology. In this review, our aim is to present one of the most recently discovered causes of thrombocytopenia, which is the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the therapeutic challenges it poses in association with an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.","output":"COVID-19A Trigger Factor for Severe Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia in Active Rheumatoid Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adherence to recommended age-specific immunisation schedules is critical in ensuring vaccine effectiveness against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). There is limited data on immunisation timeliness in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study assessed the timeliness of age-specific routine childhood immunisation within the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Participant records (N = 709) from a prospective health-facility based study conducted in Cape Town, SA in 2012C2016 were analysed. The outcome measure was receiving age-specific immunisations 4 weeks of that recommended for age as per the South African Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI-SA) schedule. Proportions, medians, inter-quartile ranges (IQR) and regression were used to obtain the prevalence, time-at-risk, and risk factors for delayed immunisation. A total of 652 /709 (91.9%) participants were eligible. Immunisation coverage declined with age from 94.9% (95% CI 92.9C96.4) at birth to 72.0% (95% CI 65.7C77.6) at 18 months. The highest delay in the uptake of vaccine doses was observed among the 3 rd dose of the DTP vaccine [163 (34.6% (95% CI 30.3C39.1)], while the lowest was seen among BCG [40 (6.5% (95% CI 4.7C8.8)]. The longest median time-at-risk of VPDs was among the 2 nd dose of the measles vaccine [12.9 (IQR 6.7C38.6) weeks] and the lowest was OPV birth dose [IQR 6.3 (5.3C9.1) weeks]. Low and upper-middle socio-economic quartiles were associated with delayed uptake of vaccine doses. Delayed vaccination increases the time of susceptibility to VPDs during infancy and childhood. There is a need to develop strategies aimed at mitigating factors associated with delay in uptake of routine childhood vaccines in the Western Cape. Mitigation strategies should provide vaccine education and mobile reminder systems. Education about timely vaccine uptake will aid in the provision of informed council from healthcare providers to caregivers.

Indeed, the most important and frequent tasks that our brain deals with every day are foraging and feeding.

The perception of flavor is multisensory and involves combinations of gustatory and olfactory stimuli. The cross-modal mapping between these modalities needs to be more explored in the virtual environment and simulation, especially in liquid food. In this paper, we present a customized wearable Augmented Reality (AR) system and olfaction display to study the effect of vision and olfaction on the gustatory sense. A user experiment and extensive analysis conducted to study the influence of each stimulus on the overall flavor, including other factors like age, previous experience in Virtual Reality (VR)/AR, and beverage consumption. The result showed that smell contributes strongly to the flavor with less contribution to the vision. However, the combination of these stimuli can deliver richer experience and a higher belief rate. Beverage consumption had a significant effect on the flavor belief rate. Experience is correlated with stimulus and age is correlated with belief rate, and both indirectly affected the belief rate.","output":"Augmented reality flavor: cross-modal mapping across gustation, olfaction, and vision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, attempts to conserve resources and limit virus spread have resulted in delay of nonemergent procedures across all medical specialties including cardiac electrophysiology. Many patients have delayed care and continue to express concerns about potential nosocomial spread of coronavirus. OBJECTIVE: To quantify risk of development of COVID19 due to in-hospital transmission related to an electrophysiology procedure, in the setting of preventive measures instituted in our laboratory areas. METHODS: We contacted patients by telephone who underwent emergent procedures in the electrophysiology lab during the COVID19 surge at our hospital (3/16/2020 to 5/15/2020, reaching daily census 450 COVID19 patients,) > two weeks after the procedure, to assess for symptoms of and/or testing for COVID-19, and assessed outcomes from medical record review. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients undergoing EP procedures in this period, none had developed documented or suspected coronavirus infection. 7 patients described symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; 3 were tested for coronavirus and found to be negative. Of the remaining 4, 2 had a more plausible alternative explanation for the symptoms, and 2 had transient symptoms not meeting published criteria for probable COVID19 infection. CONCLUSION: Despite a high hospital census of COVID-19 patients during the period of hospital stay for an electrophysiology procedure, there were no likely COVID-19 infections occurring in follow up of at least two weeks.

All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the uptake of clinical trials that have changed axillary management in breast cancer patients at MSH and non-MSH cancer centers. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients eligible for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 and Z1071 trials, and mastectomy patients fulfilling the European AMAROS trial. Uptake of trial results (omission of axillary lymph node dissection) was analyzed between patients treated at MSHs and non-MSHs and adjusted for patient, tumor, and facility factors. MSHs were defined as the top decile of hospitals according to the proportion of Black and Hispanic patients treated. RESULTS: Of 7167 patients eligible for Z0011, 4546 for Z0171, and 9433 for AMAROS from 2015 to 2016, clinical trial uptake was seen in 1195 (74.6%) MSH and 4056 (72.9%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.173) for Z0011, 588 (41.9%) MSH and 1366 (43.5%) non-MSH patients for Z1071 (p = 0.302), and 272 (11.7%) MSH and 996 (14.0%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.005) for AMAROS.

Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data for mortality and cerebrovascular morbidity. Results are reported as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The 9 studies included 8018 patients who underwent 8028 CAS procedures (4018 open-cell stents, 4010 closed-cell stents). Six studies were retrospective in design, one was a registry, and only two studies prospectively compared the effect of different cell designs. Nearly half of the patients (3452, 43.1%) were symptomatic, with no significant difference between the closed- and open-cell stent groups (p=0.93).

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 2067 participants, with 1961 young adults (mean age 23.3  4.1) and 106 mature adults (mean age 66.7  9.7). Participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the alcohol drinking behaviour before and during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: After implementation of lockdown, the alteration of alcohol consumption was significantly different between young and mature adults (p < 0.001). Among young adults, 42% reported unchanged drinking behaviour compared to 76% in the mature adult group; 44% of young adults reported to drink less compared to only 7% of mature adults. An increase in alcohol consumption was only reported by 14% of young adults and 17% of mature adults. Interestingly, in the entire cohort, the change of alcohol intake was most pronounced among moderate drinkers (> 0 to < 5 drinks/week) in both age groups (p < 0.001).

First, IgM C long thought to be a perfect pentamer C was shown to be asymmetric, resembling a quasi-hexamer missing one monomer and containing a gap. Second, this gap allows IgM to serve as carrier of a specific host protein, apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM), which is released to promote removal of dead-cell debris, cancer cells, or pathogens. Third, recombinant IgM delivered mucosally by passive immunization gave proof-of-concept that this antibody class can prevent mucosal simian-human immunodeficiency virus transmission in non-human primates. Finally, IgMs role in adaptive immunity goes beyond being only a first defender to respond to pathogen invasion, as long-lived IgM plasma cells have been observed predominantly residing in the spleen. In fact, IgM produced by such cells contained somatic hypermutations and was linked to protection against lethal influenza virus challenge in murine models.

Furthermore, those future healthcare workers will advise people to accept the COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, the attitude of students towards vaccine acceptance and the predicting factors needs to be elucidated. This study applied the Health Belief Model to determine predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among health professions students. Methods: 911 students participated in a cross\\\\sectional online survey in Vietnam. Multinomial logistic regression model determined predictors of the COVID-19 vaccine acceptability. Results: The overall vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal rates were 58% (95% CI: 54.7% - 61.3%), 40.4% (95% CI: 37.2% - 43.7%) and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8% - 2.6%), respectively. Regarding vaccination hesitancy, a predictor such as \\"Receiving recent flu shots had a negative correlation, whereas \\"Vaccines haves little efficacy & serious adverse effects (Perceived barriers), nationality, and majors were positive correlates.

This paper aimed to report our experience with spine emergency surgery during the pandemic, with already limited resources for surgery. Methods This was a retrospective, single-center study, involving all patients admitted to our hospital during a period of 1st March C 31st December 2020 and underwent emergent spinal surgery. The data were collected from the patients medical records. Results We found 15 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Four patients were suspected to be infected by COVID-19, but none of them was confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 based on the PCR test. All patients had a history of injury: fell from height (53.3%), traffic accident (40%), and direct trauma (6.7%). The average time interval from injury to hospital admission was 38.6 h, from admission to surgery was 6.3 days, and from injury to surgery was 8.1 days. The patient who was suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has a significantly greater time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.012). The surgery lasted for 3C6 h, with an average of 4.6 h. The average hospital stay duration was 13.3 days and it has a significant positive correlation with the time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.001). Three months post-operatively, seven patients experienced an improvement in the Frankel grade, 4 patients had no changes in Frankel grade, and 2 patients died. Conclusion To our experience, the lack of human and material resources during the pandemic caused some delay in surgery. However, surgery performed later than 24 h during the pandemic might still bring benefit to the patient.","output":"Emergent spine surgery during COVID-19 pandemic: 10 Months experience in Dr. Sardjito general hospital, Indonesia a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While successful containment measures of COVID-19 in China and many European countries have led to flattened curves, case numbers are rising dramatically in other countries, with the emergence of a second wave expected Asymptomatic individuals carrying SARS-CoV-2 are hidden drivers of the pandemic, and infectivity studies confirm the existence of transmission by asymptomatic individuals The data addressed here show that characteristics of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection are not identical Younger age correlates strongly with asymptomatic and mild infections and children as hidden drivers The estimated proportion of asymptomatic infections ranges from 18% to 81% The current perception of asymptomatic infections does not provide clear guidance for public-health measures Asymptomatic infections will be a key contributor in the spread of COVID-19 Asymptomatic cases should be reported in official COVID-19 statistics","output":"Asymptomatic SARS coronavirus 2 infection: invisible yet invincible.

Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory illness, other systems including gastrointestinal (GI) system and liver may be involved because of the ubiquitous nature of ACE-2 receptors in various cell lines that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes to enter host cells. It appears that GI symptoms and liver enzyme abnormalities are common in COVID-19. The involvement of the GI tract and liver correlates with the severity of disease. A minority (10C20%) of patients with COVID-19 may also present initially with only GI complaints. The most common GI symptoms are anorexia, loss of smell, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Viral RNA can be detected in stool in up to 50% of patients, sometimes even after pharyngeal clearance, but it is unclear whether fecalCoral transmission occurs. Liver enzymes are elevated, usually mild (2C3 times), in a substantial proportion of patients. There are many confounding factors that could cause liver enzyme abnormalities including medications, sepsis, and hypoxia. Although infection rates in those with preexisting liver disease are similar to that of general population, once infected, patients with liver disease are more likely to have a more severe disease and a higher mortality.

Through Bioinformatics databases lncMAP, TCGA and GTEx, we predicted the downstream transcription factors E2F1 and AGR2 of MALAT1 in breast cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases were used to screen the downstream target genes of MALAT1. MeRIP-qPCR was used to detect the m6 A level of MALAT1 in cells. RIP was used to detect the binding between MALAT1 and E2F1, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for the binding of E2F1 to AGR2 promoter. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect cell viability. Transwell was used to detect cell invasion. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot were used to detect the expression of related genes and proteins. A nude mouse xenograft tumor model was established to observe the effect of METTL3 on adriamycin resistance of breast cancer. The total survival of mice after exogenous gene silencing was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. METTL3 was highly expressed in adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells. METTL3 promotes adriamycin resistance in breast cancer cells. METTL3 mediates the expression of MALAT1 in adriamycin-resistant breast cancer through m6 A. MALAT1 increases adriamycin resistance in breast cancer cells by recruiting E2F1 to activate AGR2 transcription. METTL3 can regulate the expression of MALAT1 through m6 A, mediate the E2F1/AGR2 axis, and promote the adriamycin resistance of breast cancer. METTL3 may modify MALAT1 protein through m6 A, recruit E2F1 and activate downstream AGR2 expression, thus promoting adriamycin resistance in breast cancer.","output":"Effect of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 -mediated MALAT1/E2F1/AGR2 axis on adriamycin resistance in breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-directed violence (SDV) is a significant public health issue for adolescents and emerging adults, and yet youth exposure to prevention messaging and youth perspectives on SDV prevention needs are understudied.

The use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant therapy with western drugs can lower the fatality rate due to the COVID-19. Therefore, in silico molecular docking study was performed to search potential phytochemicals and drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Experimental procedure: The protein-protein docking of the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 was carried out with the virus spike (S) protein to examine the conformational details and residues involved in the complex formation. Subsequently, a library of 163 ligands containing phytochemicals and drugs was virtually screened to propose potential hits that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Results and conclusion: The phytochemicals like limonin, gedunin, eribulin, pedunculagin, limonin glycoside and betunilic acid bind at the active site of both furin and TMPRSS2. Limonin and gedunin found mainly in the citrus fruits and neem showed the highest binding energy at the active site of furin and TMPRSS2, respectively.

Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions' (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network.

Saliva and plasma samples were collected from 7 male Shiba goats weekly in spring and summer for measurement of testosterone (T; ng/ml), estradiol (E2; pg/ml), and cortisol (ng/ml) using radioimmunoassay. The changes in testicular volumes (TV/ml) and echogenicity were monitored weekly using ultrasonographic assessments concomitantly with subjective evaluations of semen parameters. Results revealed a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.72; P < 0.0001) between plasma and salivary cortisol. Mild significant positive correlation was found between salivary and plasma T levels (r = 0.31; P < 0.002). However, low non-significant negative correlation was reported between salivary and plasma E2 levels (r = -0.24; P > 0.05). Higher levels of salivary cortisol were found in summer than in the spring (3.8  0.6 ng/ml versus 1.4  0.3 ng/ml; P < 0.001).

For some patients this can have serious short and long-term consequences to their health and life expectancy. The NHS has limited resources and is looking for new ways to meet many demands and patient needs. This Rapid Review Report aims to answer the question: Which innovations can be used to accelerate the patients journey through the endoscopic cancer diagnosis pathway?. The report highlights evidence of innovations and new ways to improve the timeliness of access to endoscopy and to address the backlog of unmet need for patients who have waited a long time for such tests and investigations by selecting those at highest for prioritisation. It does not evaluate in terms of effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Key Findings Extent of the evidence base Nine papers were included in the rapid review in total. Two reviews were identified. One review examined the novel colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) procedure and the second review summarised the effects of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, the potential long-term? outcomes, and ways to adapt CRC screening during the COVID-19 pandemic. {blacksquare} Seven primary studies assessed innovations for the diagnosis of Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Five of these studies examined faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for prioritising patients for further testing. Two studies reported pathways/innovations to triage patients e.g. from primary care. These methods of triage used interventions such as Cytosponge for oesophageal symptoms. Recency of the evidence base Of the primary studies, one was published in 2020 and six were published in 2021. Of the reviews, one was published in 2020 and one in 2021. Evidence of effectiveness The five studies investigating FIT found that it could help prioritise patients for further testing and improve targeting of high-risk patients. One review proposed CCE may offer a useful solution for investigating colorectal patients to reduce the need for some endoscopies following the pandemic. One review found a shift from current CRC screening and surveillance practices towards an individualized approach based on risk factors, could result in the allocation of resources to people with higher risks and prevent inappropriate use of healthcare resources for those with lower risks. Best quality evidence All studies were quality appraised using the relevant JBI checklist. Five studies were of low to moderate quality. Policy Implications Increased use of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) could reduce the endoscopy backlog and save NHS resources if those with low FIT scores can be excluded from further testing. Policy in Wales supports prioritisation of potential gastrointestinal cancer patients for endoscopy using FIT test scores (NHS Wales 2021) although local implementation currently varies, so it is not yet fully utilised. The FIT test gives results which could be utilised by healthcare professionals to prioritise those who are most in need of urgent diagnosis. The viability of this method to prioritise those in greatest need of being referred for diagnosis through endoscopy is proven (though safety-netting is still required), and the FIT test is part of the diagnostic pathway already in Wales. It will be important to ensure all areas of Wales have equal access to the use of FIT testing for this purpose, and that clinical guidelines are harmonised and adhered to throughout Wales. Innovations to reduce backlog and speed up time to diagnosis should be explored including: o Triage in primary care settings such as GP surgeries using innovations such as the cytosponge for oesophageal symptoms (e.g. reflux). o Direct referral from primary care settings to specialist investigation, without the need for prior additional referrals in secondary care. Strength of Evidence The evidence presented in this review is recent, however with small samples (di Pietro et al., 2020), short-term follow up periods (Sagar et al., 2020) and assumptions required for modelling studies (Loveday et al., 2021). This reduces the generalisability and confidence of conclusions. The confidence in the strength of evidence about FIT testing is rated as low-moderate confidence. Cytosponge evidence is rated low confidence.","output":"Which innovations can improve timeliness of investigations and address the backlog in endoscopy for patients with potential symptoms of upper and lower Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers?

The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate whether an intervention consisting of guided DMRs, supported by a remote specialist and audit/feedback on care performance will reduce ICU length of stay compared with a control group. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, controlled, cluster-randomised superiority trial including 30 ICUs in Brazil (15 intervention and 15 control), from August 2019 to June 2021. In a parallel assignment, ICUs are randomised to a complex-intervention composed by daily rounds carried out through Tele-ICU by a remote ICU physician; development of local quality indicators dashboards coupled with monthly meetings with local leadership; and dissemination of evidence-based clinical protocols versus usual care. Primary outcome is ICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes include classification of the unit according to the profiles defined by the standardised resource use and the standardised mortality rate, hospital mortality, incidence of healthcare-associated infections, ventilator-free days at 28 days, patient-days receiving oral or enteral feeding, patient-days under light sedation or alert and calm, rate of patients under normoxaemia. All adult patients admitted after the beginning of the study in each participant ICU will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria (clusters): public Brazilian ICUs with a minimum of 8 ICU beds interested/committed to participating in the study. Exclusion criteria (clusters): units with fully established DMRs by an intensivist, specialised or step-down units.

Newer research and old experience with other corona-viruses highlighted a probable underlying mechanism of disturbance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is associ-ated with intrinsic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE In this review, we aimed to describe the intimate connections between the RAS components, the immune system and COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS This non-systematic review article summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between COVID-19 and the RAS. RESULTS Several studies have indicated that the downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 may exert a key role for the impairment of immune functions and for COVID-19 patients' outcome. The downregulation may occur by distinct mecha-nisms, particularly: (1) the shedding process induced by SARS-CoV-2 fusion pathway, which reduces the amount of mem-brane-bound ACE2, stimulating more shedding by the high levels of Angiotensin II; (2) the endocytosis of ACE2 receptor with the virus itself and (3) by the interferon inhibition caused by SARS-CoV-2 effects on immune system, which leads to reduction of ACE2 receptor expression. CONCLUSION Recent research provides evidence of a reduction of the components of the alternative RAS axis, including ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7). In contrast, increased levels of Angiotensin II can activate the AT1 receptor in several organs. Consequently, increased inflammation, thrombosis and angiogenesis occur in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Atten-tion should be paid to the interactions of the RAS and COVID-19, mainly in the context of novel vaccines and proposed medications.","output":"Downregulation of Membrane-bound Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Receptor has a Pivotal Role in COVID-19 Immunopathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kidney involvement is a feature of COVID-19 and it can be severe in Black patients. Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a \\"two-hit\\" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The alarming speed at which SARS-CoV-2 has spread, and the high mortality rate of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has required both basic science and clinical research to move at an unprecedented pace. Models previously developed to study the immune response against SARS-CoV have been rapidly deployed to now study SARS-CoV-2. To date, both small and large animal models are remarkably consistent when infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, certain models have proven more useful when answering specific immunological questions than others. Small animal models, such as Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice carrying the hACE2 transgene, appear to reliably recapitulate the initial cytokine surge seen in COVID-19 as well as show significant innate and adaptive cell infiltration in to the lung early in infection. Additionally, these models develop strong antibody responses to the virus, are protected from reinfection, and genetically modified versions exist that can be used to ask specific immunological questions. Large animal models such as rhesus and cynomologus macaques and African green monkeys are critical to understanding how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection because they are considered to be the most similar to humans. These models are considered the gold standard for assessing vaccine efficacy and protection, and recapitulate the initial cytokine surge, immune cell infiltration into the lung, certain aspects of thrombosis, and the antibody and T-cell response to the virus.

Despite high scientific and public interest and multiple research reports, there is currently no consensus on the association of environmental factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To address this research gap, we aimed to assess the relative risk of transmission associated with weather conditions and ambient air pollution. METHODS: In this global analysis, we adjusted for the delay between infection and detection, estimated the daily reproduction number at 3739 global locations during the COVID-19 pandemic up until late April, 2020, and investigated its associations with daily local weather conditions (ie, temperature, humidity, precipitation, snowfall, moon illumination, sunlight hours, ultraviolet index, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and pressure data) and ambient air pollution (ie, PM(25), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulphur dioxide). To account for other confounding factors, we included both location-specific fixed effects and trends, controlling for between-location differences and heterogeneities in locations responses over time. We built confidence in our estimations through synthetic data, robustness, and sensitivity analyses, and provided year-round global projections for weather-related risk of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission. FINDINGS: Our dataset included data collected between Dec 12, 2019, and April 22, 2020. Several weather variables and ambient air pollution were associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across 3739 global locations. We found a moderate, negative relationship between the estimated reproduction number and temperatures warmer than 25C (a decrease of 37% [95% CI 19C54] per additional degree), a U-shaped relationship with outdoor ultraviolet exposure, and weaker positive associations with air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, diurnal temperature, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. Results were robust to multiple assumptions. Independent research building on our estimates provides strong support for the resulting projections across nations. INTERPRETATION: Warmer temperature and moderate outdoor ultraviolet exposure result in a slight reduction in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, changes in weather or air pollution alone are not enough to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with other factors having greater effects.

We conducted a literature search of online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google scholar for relevant materials on biochemical changes in SARS-COV-2 infections published between December 2019 and March 2021. The review shows that SARS-COV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for attachment and entry into host cells. These ACE2 are abundantly expressed by the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and moderately expressed by the epithelial cells of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ileum, rectum, cholangiocytes, liver hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and kidney tubular cells. This explains the systemic nature of SARS-COV-2 infection, and the high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a total sample of 517 people who live in urban (Jakarta) and semi-urban (Depok) areas. The research data was collected online and purposively through Posyandu cadres who have access to family/community. Food security was measured using HFIAS (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale) method, while impact of COVID-19 pandemic was categorized into two categories: impacted (reduced income and laid off) and less impacted (not reduced income and laid off). Data analysis used the Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 65.0% of households with various level of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that family income during the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 4.2; CI = 2.7C6.7), the type of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., reduced income and stopped working (AOR = 2.6; CI = 1.6C4.1), and the age of the respondent (AOR = 1.7; CI = 1.1C2.5) were significantly related to household food security during the pandemic after being controlled by husband's work status. Households with lower income had 4 times higher risk to experience food insecurity compared to those with higher income. Heavily impacted households (through reduced income and stopped working) had 3 times higher risk to experience food insecurity compared to those who did not.

Findings: While measurements of discrimination - area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) - were significantly different among the groups, they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration - standardised mortality ratio (SMR) - indicated persistent, and in some cases significant, patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites. The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically significant.

Knowledge of the cerebral hemodynamic response to painful stimuli contributes to understanding of cortical pain processing and the neurovascular network in the preterm brain. Previous research has demonstrated cerebral hemodynamic responses using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) after noxious stimuli in infants appropriately grown for age (AGA). But this has not been studied in infants born small for gestational age after fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR infants differ in brain development due to utero-placental insufficiency leading to the intrauterine growth restriction, and cerebral response to pain may be altered. Objectives: We aimed to compare the cerebral hemodynamic response to painful stimuli (heel lance) in FGR and AGA infants. Methods: Preterm FGR infants (n = 20) and AGA infants (n = 15) born at 28-32 weeks' gestation were studied at mean  SD postnatal age of 11.5  2.4 and 10.5  2.4 days, respectively. Infants had baseline echocardiographic assessment of ductus arteriosus and stroke volume. They were monitored with NIRS for changes in tissue oxygenation index (TOI, %), and oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (O2Hb, HHb, and THb) in contralateral and ipsilateral cerebral hemispheres, during a heel lance. Results: At baseline, FGR infants had significantly lower TOI, higher heart rate, and lower stroke volume compared to AGA infants. Most infants in both groups showed increase in each of the NIRS parameters in the contralateral hemisphere following heel lance. However, more AGA infants (6/15) showed decreased THb compared to FGR infants (1/20) (p = 0.016). The magnitude of cerebral hemodynamic response and time to response did not differ between FGR and AGA infants. FGR infants showed larger O2Hb in the contralateral compared to ipsilateral cortex (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Preterm FGR infants have reduced stroke volume and lower cerebral oxygenation compared to AGA infants in the second to third week of life. FGR infants show similar cerebral hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli compared to AGA infants. However, FGR infants are less likely to have a cerebral vasoconstrictive response, possibly due to cerebrovascular changes following placental insufficiency and brain sparing in-utero.","output":"The Cerebral Hemodynamic Response to Pain in Preterm Infants With Fetal Growth Restriction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widespread human SARS-CoV-2 infections combined with human-wildlife interactions create the potential for reverse zoonosis from humans to wildlife.

The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. AIM Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. POPULATION 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. METHODS A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. RESULTS Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability. This unexpected and reassuring result may reveal a worrying scenario regarding the social participation and quality of life of people with disabilities: were they already in lockdown?","output":"Psycho-social impact of social distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19 containment measures on patients with physical disabilities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 has different features.

The recent Call to Action from the American College of Sports Medicine has promoted \\"innovative strategies to promote PA during the COVID-19 pandemic\\". We aimed to identify individual-level factors that protected against declines in PA levels amid the COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: We utilized the Pennington Biomedical COVID-19 Health Behaviors Survey for our analyses and used mixed-effect linear and generalized linear models to estimate the effects of individual-level factors on changes in PA levels during the COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: Participants (n=4,376) provided information on PA behaviors before and during the COVID-19 shutdown. Overall, PA levels declined by a mean (SD) of 112 (1,460) MET minutes/week during the COVID-19 shutdown; however, changes in PA were heterogeneous, with 55% of the participants reporting increases in or maintenance of PA during that time. Several social and demographic factors were significantly related to declines in PA, including high pre-pandemic PA levels, living alone (difference=118 MET minutes/week), low household income (difference between the highest and lowest income group=363 MET minutes/week), COVID-19-related changes in income (difference=110 MET minutes/week), and loss of employment (difference=168 MET minutes/week). Substitution of pre-pandemic gym attendance with the purchase and use of home exercise equipment or exercise through virtual fitness platforms promoted increases in PA during the COVID-19 shutdown. CONCLUSIONS: While promoting PA through the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider demographic factors, which greatly influence health behaviors and implementation of, and access to, replacement behaviors. Promotion of such strategies could help maintain PA levels during potential future stay-at-home orders.","output":"Factors Protecting against a Decline in Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world progression has ceased with the unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and urges the requirement for contact-less and autonomous services and applications.

The objective of this systematic review was to identify clinical and laboratory features that differentiate dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue-endemic populations. METHOD Systematic review of the literature from 1990 to 30 October 2007 including English publications comparing dengue and OFI. RESULTS Among 49 studies reviewed, 34 did not meet our criteria for inclusion. Of the 15 studies included, 10 were prospective cohort studies and five were case-control studies. Seven studies assessed all ages, four assessed children only, and four assessed adults only. Patients with dengue had significantly lower platelet, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, and a higher frequency of petechiae than OFI patients. Higher frequencies of myalgia, rash, haemorrhagic signs, lethargy/prostration, and arthralgia/joint pain and higher haematocrits were reported in adult patients with dengue but not in children. Most multivariable models included platelet count, WBC, rash, and signs of liver damage; however, none had high statistical validity and none considered changes in clinical features over the course of illness. CONCLUSIONS Several individual clinical and laboratory variables distinguish dengue from OFI; however, some variables may be dependent on age. No published multivariable model has been validated. Study design, populations, diagnostic criteria, and data collection methods differed widely across studies, and the majority of studies did not identify specific aetiologies of OFIs.

The present study aimed to investigate the levels and related factors of sleep quality of healthcare professionals fighting against COVID-19 in high risk area (Hubei Province) and low risk area (Jiangsu Province), and association between sleep quality and health. Methods: : A total of 253 healthcare professionals in Hubei Province (n=119, female 72.3%, mean age=32.135.50, nurse 80.7%) and Jiangsu Province(n=134, female 94.0%, mean age=30.25.52, nurse 96.3%) were surveyed from February to March 2020. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index, PSQI) and health were assessed using an internet survey. Results: : The global PSQI score of Hubei sample and Jiangsu sample was 9.745.00 and 7.794.64, respectively. The global PSQI score and the scores of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and use of sleep medications in Hubei sample were significantly higher than that of Jiangsu sample (p<0.05).

Exposure to PM has been related to new cases and to the clinical severity of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, which can be explained by the oxidative stress and the inflammatory response generated by these particles when entering the respiratory system, as well as by the role of PM in the expression of ACE-2 in respiratory cells in human hosts. In addition, different authors have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PM sampled both in outdoor and indoor environments.

Endovascular treatment is standard acute revascularization therapy for stroke in adults, but it is not well-studied in pediatrics. We report the successful treatment of two pediatric cases of anterior circulation stroke with primary mechanical thrombectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Asian children, aged 13 and 8 years, presented to Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital in September 2020 and April 2021, respectively, with hemiplegia and significant Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (Ped NIHSS) scores. Head CT scans demonstrated hyperdense middle cerebral artery signs, suggesting large-vessel occlusion stroke. Both patients underwent emergent thrombectomy within 5 and 10 h after initial onset, and successful recanalization was achieved within an hour. Both demonstrated good neurological recovery and there was no recurrent stroke during follow-up. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Thrombectomy has appeal for childhood acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to a longer post-stroke time window for intervention. As the short-term outcome, a significantly reduced Ped NIHSS score is achieved. Long-term outcomes are measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. A literature review from 2016 to 2021 yielded 21 pediatric case reports of primary mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation stroke (including the present cases).

The renin-angiotensin (RAS) signaling pathway, oxidative stress and cell death, cytokines storm and endothelial dysfunction are four major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of nCoV 19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) generally develops with a massive oxidative/nitrosative stress following virus entry and RAS activation. The DNA damage subsequent to oxidative burst activates poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), viral macrodomain (NSP3) poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and transient receptor potential channel, melastatin 2 (TRPM2) in a sequential manner ultimately leading to apoptosis and necrosis due to NAD and ATP depletion.

Respiratory complications and fever are the most obvious symptoms. Sometimes the neurological features are superimposed on the main disease and complicate patient's status. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe 6 patients with COVID-19 and concomitant quadriparesia who underwent electrodiagnosis using EMG/NCS and results indicated 3 axonal variants of GuillainCBarr syndrome (GBS), including; 2 cases AMAN (acute motor axonal neuropathy), 1 case AMSAN (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy), three myopathies, including one combination of CIN/CIM (critical illness neuropathy/critical illness myopathy), one CIM and one acute polymyositis in these cases. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of the neuromuscular disorders of coronavirus could help for correct planning in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Since GBS and inflammatory myopathies have an autoimmune basis, the immunotherapies such as IVIG, steroids, plasma exchange and other novel treatments as hemoperfusion can promise better and faster recovery in respiratory function and neuromuscular activity among COVID-19 patients who have musculature paralysis concomitantly. However, all these treatments are challenging and further clinical trials should be done to confirm the efficacy and safety of mentioned therapies.","output":"Electrophysiologic findings in patients with COVID-19 and quadriparesia in the northwest of Iran, A case series study and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining when two individuals are within close distance is key to contain a pandemic, e.g., to alert individuals in real-time and trace their social contacts.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of autologous PRP on the osteogenic potential of combining bovine porous bone mineral (BPBM) and bio-guide membrane (BGM) in promoting mandible bicortical bony defects in rabbits. METHODS One circular mandible bicortical bony defects were created in each of 54 rabbits, which were divided into 3 groups: group 1: 18 of the defects were left unfilled as a negative control; group 2: 18 of the defects were grafted with autologous PRP and BPBM/BGM; group 3: 18 of the defects were grafted with BPBM/BGM without PRP. Animals were killed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Harvested tissue and specimens were evaluated histologically and radiographically, and metabolized observation was performed. Histological parameters associated with osteoblast activities, bone trabecula, neovascularization, newly formed mineralized bone, rudimental grafts and connective tissue formation were measured. Densities of the bones at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were studied by radiographic. The bone defect closure ratio was measured at 12 weeks. The bone metabolized parameter alkaline phosphatase was also measured and compared between 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS The platelet concentration of PRP is 4.19- to 4.43-fold to that of the whole blood. Histological analysis showed new bone formation at all therapeutic sites including BPBM/BGM grafts with or without PRP. A statistically significant difference in new bone formation between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and group BPBM/BGM was observed. Untreated defects of group control showed the less bone regeneration. There was significant difference of bone density between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and control, and group BPBM/BGM and control, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative. There were more bone defects filling, and the grafts were absorbed at 12 weeks of group PRP/BPBM/BGM compared with group BPBM/BGM. Defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM demonstrated significantly increased activity of osteoblasts, enhanced amount of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in osteoblasts, and increased concentration of alkaline phosphatase at 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared with those treated with BPBM/BGM and control group. Complete closure ratio of bone defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM (50%) was significantly increased compared with that treated with BPBM/BGM (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that PRP combination of BPBM and BGM had significant therapeutic effects on mandible bicortical bony defects of rabbits. The effects are associated with the high concentration of platelet in PRP and the porous configuration of BPBM. Although we cannot reveal the detailed statistical relationship of PRP on promoting BPBM/GBM osteoinductive effects, PRP demonstrated superior results of bone regeneration.","output":"Effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma in combination with bovine porous bone mineral and bio-guide membrane on bone regeneration in mandible bicortical bony defects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every country Currently, no suitable vaccine or treatment has been identified;therefore, each country has attempted to issue appropriate policies, designed to reduce and prevent increases in the numbers of extreme cases Transmission can be prevented by implementing social restrictions, also known as social distancing The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued several methods for the prevention of transmission, including social distancing, washing hands with soap (or using hand sanitizer containing at least 70% alcohol), and using masks Over time, the term social distance has changed to physical distance Evaluating the impacts of different types of non-pharmacological interventions has been challenging","output":"From Social Distancing to Physical Distancing: A Challenge for Evaluating Public Health Intervention against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a significant burden on hospitals worldwide Objective biomarkers for early risk stratification and clinical management are still lacking The aim of this work was to determine whether bioactive adrenomedullin can assist in the risk stratification and clinical management of critically ill COVID-19 patients Fifty-three patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this prospective observational cohort study between March and April 2020 Bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) plasma concentration was measured daily for seven days after admission The prognostic value and clinical significance of bio-ADM plasma levels were evaluated for the severity of respiratory failure, the need for extracorporeal organ support and outcome (28-day mortality) Bio-ADM levels increased with the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS;p &lt;0 001) and were significantly elevated in invasively ventilated patients (p = 0 006) and patients in need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p = 0 040) or renal replacement therapy (RRT;p &lt;0 001) compared to patients without these conditions Non-survivors showed significantly higher bio-ADM levels than survivors (p = 0 010) Bio-ADM levels predicted 28-day mortality (C-index 0 72, 95% confidence interval 0 56C0 87, p &lt;0 001) Bio-ADM plasma levels correlate with disease severity, the need for extracorporeal organ assistance, and outcome, and highlight the promising value of bio-ADM in the early risk stratification and management of patients with COVID-19","output":"Prognostic Value of Bioactive Adrenomedullin in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 in Germany: An Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been known to involve in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases.

Thermoregulation is achieved by changes in behavior and the selection of micro-habitats with adequate temperatures to maintain the body temperature (Tb) within a range of preference. Apart from this temperature dependence at spatial scales, ectotherms are also affected by temperature at temporal scale. For instance, ectotherms can only be active some months of the year, particularly in temperate environments. Tarantulas are ectotherms that live in burrows most of their life. Nevertheless, after the sexual maturation molt, males leave their refugia and start a wandering life searching for females to mate. The reproductive period varies among species. In some species walking males are seen in late spring or early summer, while in other species males are only seen during fall or winter. Apart from the differences in lifestyles after maturation, tarantulas exhibit sexual dimorphisms in longevity and body mass, having smaller, shorter-lived males. Thus, to optimize energetic budgets, decreasing thermoregulation costs, we hypothesize and examine a putative correlation between an individual's preferred body temperature (Tpref) and the environmental temperature during the reproductive period. Hence, we characterize Tpref in seven tarantula species and analyze which factors (i.e., time of day, body mass, and sex) correlated with it. Furthermore, we assess putative correlated evolution of Tpref with ambient temperature (minima, mean, and maxima) during the reproductive period by means of phylogenetic independent contrasts. We did not find differences in thermal preferences between sexes; and only one species, Acanthoscurria suina, exhibited diel differences in Tpref. We found evidence of correlated evolution between Tpref and minimum temperature during the reproductive period among all seven species studied herein.

PF immunopathogenesis involves progressive alveolar epithelial cell damage, release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) injury. We assessed the dynamic role of LMW-hyaluronan (LMW-HA) as DAMP in initiation of host immune TLR-2,4 responses and as determinant in progression of ECM injury to fibrosis. Male Wistar rats were divided into Group I (saline control, n = 24) and Group II (intratracheal bleomycin, 7 U/kg/animal, n = 24). Animals were euthanized on 0, 7, 14, and 28 days. The time course of release of LMW-HA, TLR-2,4 mRNA and protein levels, and NF-B-p65 levels after bleomycin injury were correlated with the development of parenchymal inflammation, remodelling, and fibrosis. RESULTS: Acute lung injury caused by bleomycin significantly increases the pro-inflammatory LMW-HA levels and elevates TLR-2,4 levels on day 7. Subsequently, TLR-2 upregulation, TLR-4 downregulation, and NF-B signalling follow on days 14 and 28. This results in progressive tissue inflammation, alveolar and interstitial macrophage accumulation, and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: LMW-HA significantly increases in PF caused by non-infectious and infectious (Covid-19) etiologies. The accumulating HA fragments function as endogenous DAMPs and trigger inflammatory responses, through differential TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, thus promoting inflammation and macrophage influx. LMW-HA are reflective of the state of ongoing tissue inflammation and may be considered as a natural biosensor for fibrotic lung diseases and as potential therapeutic targets.","output":"Dynamic role of LMW-hyaluronan fragments and Toll-like receptors 2,4 in progression of bleomycin induced lung parenchymal injury to fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines how bribe payment by enterprises in Vietnam affects employees working conditions, particularly wage benefits and other non-monetary compensations. We exploit the variation in the interaction of the score for the transparency of the local government in a specific province, the district-sector share of enterprises engaging in bribe payment, and the sector average size of the enterprise owners social network that are public officers as an exogenous variation in the likelihood of engaging in bribe payment. The results of the analysis reveal that when an enterprise pays bribe, it reduces the wages of its employees by approximately 27.6% (mostly for those within the highest wage bracket). Employees membership of a trade union, enterprise performance, capacity for inter-jurisdictional mobility, investment in human capital development, and formality status are likely operative channels of impact. Plain English Summary Enterprises engagement in bribe payment has negative impacts on the wages of employees. Corruption and bribe payment are endemic in many developing countries and they come at a cost to the broader society. Several studies have been conducted on how corruption impacts the welfare of individuals and households, the productivity, and effective and efficient functioning of firms and government, but we contribute to this debate by considering how bribe payment at the firm level affects employees welfare. We argue that bribe payment by an enterprise has potential effects on the wages and other non-monetary compensations of their employees. Depending on the size of the bribe and the profit level of the enterprise, bribe payment may reduce or improve an enterprises cash flow. In an event that the enterprise incurs a cost for paying bribe, it may transfer the cost to its employees by either cutting their wages or adjusting other pecuniary benefits that they receive. On the other hand, if the enterprise benefits from paying bribe, employees wages and other benefits could either increase as a spillover effect or remain unchanged depending on several factors, including the enterprises appetite for further bribe payment in anticipation of reaping more benefits in the long term. We use a unique dataset from the survey of Vietnamese small- and medium-scale manufacturing enterprises to validate these propositions and the channels through which they operate. The results of the analysis show that when an enterprise pays bribe, it reduces the wages of its employees (mostly for those within the highest wage bracket) by approximately 27.6%. Our result further shows that employees membership of a trade union, an enterprises performance and its capacity to move between different jurisdictions of operation, investment in human capital development, and formality status are the potential channels through which the identified impact operates. These findings support the need for anti-corruption policies, which could have other spillover effects on decent labor outcomes in Vietnam and other developing countries.","output":"Are there wages from sin?

However, the mechanisms of its effects remain unclear. First, through literature evaluation, it was preliminarily determined that FLKM improved clinical symptoms, regulated immune inflammation response and ameliorated pulmonary function. Then, via database search and literature mining, 759 targets of the 104 active compounds of FLKM were identified. The component-target (CT) network showed that the key active compositions were resveratrol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, sesamin, and quercetin. 115 targets overlapped with pneumonia-related targets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified TNF, AKT1, IL6, JUN, VEGFA and MAPK3 as hub targets. KEGG analyses found that they were mainly enriched in immune related pathway. Next, in vivo experiment, we observed that FLKM ameliorated pathological injury of lung tissue and reduced neutrophil infiltration in rats with LPS-induced pneumonia. And FLKM decreased the concentration of TNF- and IL-6 in BALF and downregulated the expression of p38MAPK, AKT and VEGFA in lung tissue. Finally, Molecular docking tests showed tight docking of these predicted targeted proteins with key active compounds.

A majority of participants were less than 40 years old (69.8%), were White (86.0%), and were women (79.1%);mean body mass index was 24.9  4.7 kg/m(2). Of the 43 staff members tested for past COVID-19 infection, 3 (7.0%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody result. There were no unique features in the 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects;of these, 2 had known prior COVID-19 infection and 1 was asymptomatic.

The evolution of the pandemic and a fragile health system have meant that public health policy has had to rely heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. However, changes in disease dynamics and pandemic fatigue have meant that disease control policies need to be updated. Identifying variables associated with adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive practices, particularly for vulnerable groups, can therefore help inform and refine interventions in the face of pandemic fatigue and changing disease dynamics. Using recent and timely data on older (50 years and above) Syrian refugees in Lebanon, this paper explores the determinants of adherence to two non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 prevention measures (wearing a mask and avoiding social gatherings) among this high-risk subgroup in a vulnerable population. Among respondents who report adhering to these measures, the paper also identifies the determinants of sustained adherence over a period of 6 months. The findings suggest that older refugees and those less educated are less likely to wear a mask, and refugees living in informal tented settlements are more likely to relent on preventive practices within 6 months. Individuals with chronic diseases who initially report avoiding social gatherings are also likelier to desist than those without chronic illness. The lower continued adherence to mask wearing among residents of informal tented settlements points to factors beyond pandemic fatigue and that should be taken into consideration in devising measures for disease control: the potential for community-based norms to determine individual-level behavior. Recognizing the pivotal effect of community-based norms in settings such as informal tented settlements is essential in adapting current policy and designing future interventions.","output":"Too much to mask: determinants of sustained adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among older Syrian refugees in Lebanon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The lethality of infectious diseases and deep concern over growing antimicrobial resistance make it essential that alternative or adjunct therapies be developed. Areas covered: Using papers published in PubMed, a case is presented to consider beneficial microbes as a means to improve management of infectious diseases. Clinical evidence is mounting that certain probiotic microbes can contribute to this armamentarium. These could have an immediate effect against necrotizing enterocolitis, pre- and post-surgical procedures, antibiotic-associated infections, urogenital infections in women and for reducing the severity and duration of respiratory infections. While further studies will always be warranted irrespective of the intervention, and quality assurance and patient safety must remain a priority, the main barrier to implementation may well be unwarranted hesitation amongst physicians, healthcare administrators and regulators. Meanwhile, patients are already taking things into their own hands at a time when their knowledge of product selection is poor and clinical guidance is invariably missing.

Cancer history appears to be a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, though the reasons for this are unclear. In this report, we assess if extent of prior lung irradiation is a risk factor for death due to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 14(th) and April 15(th), 2020 at our institution and previously received radiotherapy for cancer in our department were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics and metrics describing the extent of lung irradiation were tabulated. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death following COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic model was used to characterize the association between mean lung radiotherapy dose and 14-day mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 107 patients met inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 7 days from COVID-19 diagnosis for surviving patients, 24 deaths have been observed. The actuarial survival rate 14 days after COVID-19 testing is 66%. Increasing mean lung dose (HR per Gy = 1.1, p=0.002), lung cancer diagnosis (HR=3.0, p=0.034), and receiving radiotherapy between one month and one year before COVID-19 testing (HR = 3.4, p=0.013) were associated with increased risk of death. Our survival model demonstrates a near linear relationship between mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis and mean lung radiotherapy dose. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with a history of radiotherapy for cancer have a poor prognosis, and mortality risk appears to be associated with extent of lung irradiation.

Although it has been speculated that viral infection of olfactory neurons may be the culprit, it is unclear whether viral infection causes injuries in the olfactory bulb region. Objective: To characterize the olfactory pathology associated with COVID-19 infection in a postmortem study. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter postmortem cohort study was conducted from April 7, 2020, to September 11, 2021. Deceased patients with COVID-19 and control individuals were included in the cohort. One infant with congenital anomalies was excluded. Olfactory bulb and tract tissue was collected from deceased patients with COVID-19 and appropriate controls. Histopathology, electron microscopy, droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry studies were performed. Data analysis was conducted from February 7 to October 19, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Severity of degeneration, (2) losses of olfactory axons, and (3) severity of microvasculopathy in olfactory tissue. Results: Olfactory tissue from 23 deceased patients with COVID-19 (median [IQR] age, 62 [49-69] years; 14 men [60.9%]) and 14 control individuals (median [IQR] age, 53.5 [33.25-65] years; 7 men [50%]) was included in the analysis. The mean (SD) axon pathology score (range, 1-3) was 1.921 (0.569) in patients with COVID-19 and 1.198 (0.208) in controls (P < .001), whereas axon density was 2.973 (0.963)  104/mm2 in patients with COVID-19 and 3.867 (0.670)  104/mm2 in controls (P = .002). Concomitant endothelial injury of the microvasculature was also noted in olfactory tissue. The mean (SD) microvasculopathy score (range, 1-3) was 1.907 (0.490) in patients with COVID-19 and 1.405 (0.233) in control individuals (P < .001). Both the axon and microvascular pathology was worse in patients with COVID-19 with smell alterations than those with intact smell (mean [SD] axon pathology score, 2.260 [0.457] vs 1.63 [0.426]; P = .002; mean [SD] microvasculopathy score, 2.154 [0.528] vs 1.694 [0.329]; P = .02) but was not associated with clinical severity, timing of infection, or presence of virus.

As part of this staggered process, primary schools are scheduled to partially reopen on 1st June. Evidence from a range of sources suggests that children are, in general, only mildly affected by the disease and have low mortality rates, though there is less certainty regarding children's role in transmission. Therefore, there is wide discussion on the impact of reopening schools. Methods: We compare eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England from 1st June, focusing on the return of particular year groups and the associated epidemic consequences. This is assessed through model simulation, modifying a previously developed dynamic transmission model for SARS-CoV-2. We quantify how the process of reopening schools affected contact patterns and anticipated secondary infections, the relative change in R according to the extent of school reopening, and determine the public health impact via estimated change in clinical cases and its sensitivity to decreases in adherence post strict lockdown. Findings: Whilst reopening schools, in any form, results in more mixing between children, an increase in R and hence transmission of the disease, the magnitude of that increase can be low dependent upon the age-groups that return to school and the behaviour of the remaining population. We predict that reopening schools in a way that allows half class sizes or that is focused on younger children is unlikely to push R above one, although there is noticeable variation between the regions of the country. Given that older children have a greater number of social contacts and hence a greater potential for transmission, our findings suggest reopening secondary schools results in larger increases in case burden than only reopening primary schools; reopening both generates the largest increase and could push R above one in some regions. The impact of less social-distancing in the rest of the population, generally has far larger effects than reopening schools and exacerbates the impacts of reopening. Discussion: Our work indicates that any reopening of schools will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, although the opening of schools alone is unlikely to push the value of R above one. However, impacts of other recent relaxations of lockdown measures are yet to be quantified, suggesting some regions may be closer to the critical threshold that would lead to a growth in cases. Given the uncertainties, in part due to limited data on COVID-19 in children, school reopening should be carefully monitored. Ultimately, the decision about reopening classrooms is a difficult trade-off between increased epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children.","output":"The impact of school reopening on the spread of COVID-19 in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While HPV vaccination uptake in Sweden is quite high, at around 80%, vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in countries throughout Europe. The latter can be related to a contemporary context of increased contestation of expert knowledge and of a large share of information on health-related issues including vaccination today being sought via the internet. Still, there is a paucity of recent research on attitudes toward the HPV vaccine in a larger sample of the population in Sweden. This survey study assesses such attitudes and any correlations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic characteristics, trust in healthcare and other societal institutions, and evaluation of the reliability of different sources of information. METHODS: The validated survey questionnaire was distributed to adult women in Sweden (n = 2,000), via a nationally representative web panel. The response rate was 37%. Aside from descriptive statistics, associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic and other variables were computed using logistic regressions and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Our results show a positive attitude toward HPV vaccination overall. Still, some degree of HPV vaccine hesitancy was indicated by 33.8% of the respondents, and more pronounced hesitancy by 7.6%. Regarding vaccination in general, a very positive attitude was indicated by 55%. HPV vaccine hesitancy was associated with low education and low income and strongly associated with a lack of confidence in healthcare and other societal institutions. It was also correlated with a self-assessed lack of access to, and ability to assess the origin, quality and reliability of, information about the HPV vaccine.

METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent computed tomography-guided MWA of early-stage NSCLC (no evidence of nodal or distant metastasis) from November 2010 to December 2014 at our institution. Data were collected from systematic review of patient charts and imaging. Procedural complications, response to treatment and survival were assessed. RESULTS 34 early-stage (T1a-T3N0M0) NSCLCs in 30 patients were treated with a total of 41 MWA sessions. There were no intraprocedural or 30-day post-procedural deaths. The most common complication was pneumothorax, encountered in 24 (59%) microwave ablation sessions, six (15%) of which required chest tube insertion. Over a median computed tomography follow-up period of 39 months (range 3-89), 24 (71%) NSCLCs demonstrated local control, while 10 (29%) demonstrated local progression. Nodal/distant progression was more common than local progression, with 15 of the 30 patients (50%) having nodal or distant metastases at follow-up.

Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37-85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1-30.7) Kg/m2 and 13 (7-22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients.

CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis. Clinical trials investigating causal relationship between intermediate thromboprophylaxis and clinical outcomes are urgently needed.","output":"Safety profile of enhanced thromboprophylaxis strategies for critically ill COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic: observational report from 28 European intensive care units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are all in this together? has been a common leadership cry during the coronavirus crisis But do their rewards designs generally reinforce collective performance?

In addition to several preventive measures such as wearing a mask, using sanitizer, measures also need to be taken to prevent anxiety and depressive disorders due to this unexpected crisis situation. Practicing yoga is one of the simple, scientific methods to combat stress and prevent anxiety among children. METHODS: The scientific evidence and anecdotal experiences on benefits of yoga is described in this paper, highlighting the importance of yoga in nurturing the mental well-being in children. RESULTS: Scientifically designed and conducted studies as part of the research programs by health professionals objectively conclude that mental health parameters improve significantly with yoga as an intervention. In addition to mental health, yoga will also improve the physical health and boost immunity among children which will also help in reducing the infection rate in children.

Understanding the various types of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for better clinical management of coronavirus outbreaks and to potentially improve future therapies. Disease dynamics can be characterized by deciphering the adaptive immune response. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed 117 peripheral blood immune repertoires from healthy controls and subjects with mild to severe COVID-19 disease to elucidate the interplay between B and T cells. We used an immune repertoire Primer Extension Target Enrichment method (immunoPETE) to sequence simultaneously human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restricted T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) and unrestricted T cell receptor delta chain (TRD) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) immune receptor repertoires. The distribution was analyzed of TRB, TRD and IgH clones between healthy and COVID-19 infected subjects. Using McFadden's Adjusted R2 variables were examined for a predictive model. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the adaptive immune repertoire on the severity of the disease (value on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale) in COVID-19. FINDINGS: Combining clinical metadata with clonotypes of three immune receptor heavy chains (TRB, TRD, and IgH), we found significant associations between COVID-19 disease severity groups and immune receptor sequences of B and T cell compartments. Logistic regression showed an increase in shared IgH clonal types and decrease of TRD in subjects with severe COVID-19. The probability of finding shared clones of TRD clonal types was highest in healthy subjects (controls). Some specific TRB clones seems to be present in severe COVID-19 (Figure S7b). The most informative models (McFaddens Adjusted R2=0.141) linked disease severity with immune repertoire measures across all three cell types, as well as receptor-specific cell counts, highlighting the importance of multiple lymphocyte classes in disease progression. INTERPRETATION: Adaptive immune receptor peripheral blood repertoire measures are associated with COVID-19 disease severity.

There is a lack of evidence-based targeted pharmacological therapy for its prevention and treatment. We aim to compare the effects of a World Health Organization recommendation-based education and a personalised complex preventive lifestyle intervention package (based on the same WHO recommendation) on the outcomes of the COVID-19. METHODS: PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomised controlled clinical trial with adaptive sample size re-estimation design. Hungarian population over the age of 60 years without confirmed COVID-19 will be approached to participate in a telephone health assessment and lifestyle counselling voluntarily. Volunteers will be randomised into two groups: (A) general health education and (B) personalised health education. Participants will go through questioning and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health, (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity, (4) dietary habits, and (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. Assessment will be done weekly during the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. The composite primary endpoint will include the rate of ICU admission, hospital admission (longer than 48 h), and mortality in COVID-19-positive cases.

In this study, we collected open access data to thoroughly analyze the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that apoptosis-related pathways were enriched in the cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results of differential expression analysis showed that biological functions related to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and lipid metabolism were disordered. TMBIM6 was identified as a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells through weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of the time course of expression of host and viral proteins.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed using our multi-institutional database to identify patients who underwent resection and LND for thymic carcinoma or thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma between 1991 and 2018. An enlarged mediastinal LN was defined as having a short-axis diameter >1 cm. We assessed survival outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: N1-level LND was performed in 41 patients (54.6%), N2-level LND in 14 patients (18.7%) and both-level LND in 16 patients (21.3%). Pathological LN metastasis was detected in 20 patients (26.7%) among the 75 patients undergoing LND. There was a significant difference in the number of LN stations (P = 0.015) and metastasis factor (P = 0.0042) between pathologically LN-positive and pathologically LN-negative patients.

We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 immune response via SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in 23 renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol.

We aimed to generate an operational list of potential RGBs and to evaluate their impact in pairs of published pilot studies and larger, more well-powered trial on the topic of childhood obesity. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review to identify published pilot studies that had a published larger-scale trial of the same or similar intervention. Searches were updated and completed through December 31st, 2018. Eligible studies were behavioral interventions involving youth (18 yrs) on a topic related to childhood obesity (e.g., prevention/treatment, weight reduction, physical activity, diet, sleep, screen time/sedentary behavior). Extracted information included study characteristics and all outcomes. A list of 9 RGBs were defined and coded: intervention intensity bias, implementation support bias, delivery agent bias, target audience bias, duration bias, setting bias, measurement bias, directional conclusion bias, and outcome bias. Three reviewers independently coded for the presence of RGBs. Multi-level random effects meta-analyses were performed to investigate the association of the biases to study outcomes. RESULTS A total of 39 pilot and larger trial pairs were identified. The frequency of the biases varied: delivery agent bias (19/39 pairs), duration bias (15/39), implementation support bias (13/39), outcome bias (6/39), measurement bias (4/39), directional conclusion bias (3/39), target audience bias (3/39), intervention intensity bias (1/39), and setting bias (0/39).

The median incubation period of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 10 days (interquartile range, 0-21 days), while the control group was 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days) (p=0.27). On the initial chest computerized tomography (CT) check, 18 (69.2%, 18/26) asymptomatic COVID-19 infections were no imaging changes, which was of no significance compared with 12 (46.2%, 12/26) patients with moderate type of confirmed patients (p=0.092).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Over October 2019CMarch 2020, we invited public and patient (PPI) and professional members of our NIDUS co-design groups to complete the PPI Engagement Evaluation Tool (designed to assess engagement activities), and non-professional PPI members to participate in qualitative telephone interviews. We thematically analysed and integrated mixed-methods findings. RESULTS: Most (15/20; 75%) of the PPI members approached participated. We identified four themes: (1) Creating the right atmosphere: participants found group meetings positive and enabling, though one health professional was unsure how to position themselves within them; (2) Participants influencing the outcome: while most members felt that they had some influence, for one carer consultation seemed too late to influence; (3) Having the right information: several carers wanted greater clarity and more regular updates from researchers; (4) Unique challenges for people living with dementia: memory problems presented challenges in engaging with substantial information, and within a large group. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We reflect on the importance of providing accessible, regular updates, managing power imbalances between co-design group members with lived and professional experiences; and ensuring needs and voices of people living with dementia are prioritised.

Previous studies have indicated that patients in the recovery phase exhibit decreased function of multiple organs. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment is recommended in the rehabilitation period of COVID-19; however, the safety and efficacy of such treatment remain to be confirmed. AIM OF STUDY: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bufei Huoxue (BFHX) in restoring the functional status and exercise tolerance of patients recovering from COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 131 patients in the rehabilitation period of COVID-19 infection were randomly divided into a Bufei Huoxue (BFHX) group (n = 66) and a placebo group (n = 65). BFHX or placebo was given orally three times a day (1.4 g/dose) for 90 days. The primary outcomes was to evaluate improvements in exercise tolerance and imaging manifestations on chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: After the exclusion of two patients who withdrew prior to receiving any medications, 129 patients were recruited, including 64 patients in the BFHX group and 65 patients in the placebo group. After 3 months of treatment, the BFHX group exhibited greater attenuation of pneumonia lesions on chest CT than the placebo group (P [Formula: see text] 0.05). Improvements in 6-min walk distance (6MWD) relative to baseline were also significantly better in the BFHX group than in the placebo group (P [Formula: see text] 0.01). Scores on the Fatigue Assessment Inventory (FAI) were lower in the BFHX group than in the placebo group (P [Formula: see text] 0.05). Although the rate of adverse events was higher in the BFHX group than in the placebo group (9.38% vs. 4.62%), the difference was not significant (P [Formula: see text] 0.3241). CONCLUSIONS: BFHX may exert strong rehabilitative effects on physiological activity in patients recovering from COVID-19, which may in turn attenuate symptoms of fatigue and improve exercise tolerance.","output":"Efficacy and safety of Bufei Huoxue capsules in the management of convalescent patients with COVID-19 infection: A multicentre, double-blind, and randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore the impact of automation and digitalization on labor in the US agrifood system during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study considers each of the primary nodes in the system stretching from consumer through grocery stores and restaurants to last-mile delivery, distribution, food processing, farming, and agri-inputs. Not only automation and digitalization, but also the role of platforms such as Amazon, and food delivery firms such as GrubHub, Instacart, and Uber Eats are discussed. For restaurants, we consider not only dine-in restaurants, but also ghost kitchens. Furthermore, the possibility that farmers or distributors could disintermediate other nodes and deal directly with consumers is discussed. We conclude that, as a generalization, the further upstream one goes from the consumer, the less immediate and disruptive automation is likely to be for labor. However, our overall conclusion is that, given the current trajectories, labor is becoming increasingly precarious. If the current labor shortages continue, then automation is likely to accelerate. Platformization, while rampant in the relationships with final consumers, is likely to be less rapidly adopted further upstream where relationships are B-to-B and thus composed of actors that are wary of sharing data.","output":"COVID-19s Impact Upon Labor and Value Chains in the Agrifood System (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persistent respiratory symptoms and lung function deficits are common after patients with TB.

At the time of development of this study, no specific medication/vaccine for this disease was approved. Therefore, preventive measures were the main key to control this pandemic. Health literacy (HL) is the ability to obtain, understand and use the information to make free and informed decisions about the health of an individual and to promote community empowerment. Thus, the HL of COVID-19 is important for community empowerment and the adoption of preventive measures. This article aims to understand possible predictors of HL of COVID-19, functional domain. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed, applying the Questionnaire of COVID-19 (previously designed and submitted to a preliminary pilot testing) through an online platform from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An Index of Health Knowledge of COVID-19 Questionnaire (IHK-COV19) was constructed. Associations between independent variables (Gender, Age, Education, and Risk Factor for COVID-19 codified by ICPC-2) and HL were assessed using multivariate analyses (mixed effects models). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Our sample includes 864 subjects (median age, 44.33 years), mostly women (n = 619; 71.76%), undergraduate (n = 392; 45.37%) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (n = 266; 30.79%). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated Age as a negative predictor of IHK-COV19 and Education and Risk Factor as positive predictors of IHK-COV19.

Although most patients presenting with absent or mild symptoms recover completely, the highest morbidity and mortality rates are seen in the elderly, and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immunosuppressive diseases, diabetes, and pre-existing respiratory illnesses. Several therapeutic strategies have been examined, but a wide-ranging therapeutic option for particularly severe cases of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. Considering the indications presented by COVID-19 patients who present similarly with inflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been examined as a possible route to reduce proinflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP and ferritin by reducing inflammation, based on its anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by utilisation of IVIG for numerous other inflammatory conditions. Herein, summarising the recent key clinical evaluations of IVIG administration, we present our hypothesis that administration of IVIG within a specific dosage would be extremely beneficial towards reducing mortality and perhaps even the length of hospitalisation of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Application of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to modulate inflammation in critical COVID-19 - A theoretical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, NF-&#954;B and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-&#954;B signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment.

AREAS COVERED High expectations have been built around mNGS; however, this technique is far from widely available. This review highlights the advances and currently available options in terms of costs, turnaround time, sensitivity, specificity, validation, and reproducibility of mNGS as a diagnostic tool in clinical microbiology laboratories. EXPERT OPINION The need for a novel diagnostic tool to increase the sensitivity of microbial diagnostics is clear. mNGS has the potential to revolutionise clinical microbiology. However, its role as a diagnostic tool has yet to be widely established, which is crucial for successfully implementing the technique. A clear definition of diagnostic algorithms that include mNGS is vital to show clinical utility.

Worldwide air quality data were collected from > 12,000 continuous air quality monitoring stations on six continents covering 1000 major cities from over 100 countries. Here, we discussed the implementation of the open-source data set of basic air pollutants such as PM 2.5, NO2, temperature, relative humidity, and Air Quality Index variation during the pre-lockdown and lockdown pandemic COVID-19 in India and described the global aspect. An average concentration of PM 2.5 (145.51 g/m3), NO2 (21.64 g/m3), and AQI index (55.58) continuously decreased. The variation of PM 2.5, NO2, normally shows more than 25 g/m3 every year, but during the COVID-19 lockdown period (April 2020) continuously decreased below 20 g/m3. Similarly, the AQI index and meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed variation decreased significantly in the many countries in the world. In Asian countries, air quality improved during the national lockdown especially in the most polluted cities globally such as Beijing, Delhi, and Nanjing and also in developed cities like Madrid, New York, Paris, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo. Furthermore, the reduction of particulate matter was in about 46%, and other gaseous pollutants during the lockdown period were observed in a 54% reduction. We are witnessing pollution reductions which add significantly to improvements in air quality. This is due to the massive decrease in the use of fossil fuel, which in turn reduces production and traffic in general. People nowadays are now willing to see a comparatively healthier world with bleached skies and natural ecosystems.

CV risk is associated with high values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and depends on the presence of risk factors, both modifiable and not modifiable, such as overweight, obesity, physical exercise, smoking, age, family history, and gender. The main target organs affected by AH are the heart, brain, vessels, kidneys, and eye retina. AH onset can be counteracted or delayed by adopting a proper diet, characterized by a low saturated fat and sodium intake, a high fruit and vegetable intake, a moderate alcohol consumption, and achieving and maintaining over time the ideal body weight. In this review, we analyzed how a new nutritional approach, named caloric restriction diet (CRD), can provide a significant reduction in blood pressure values and an improvement of the endothelial dysfunction. In fact, CRD is able to counteract aging and delay the onset of CV and neurodegenerative diseases through the reduction of body fat mass, systolic and diastolic values, free radicals production, and oxidative stress.

Building on previous research documenting the pernicious effects of stress on youth mental health, we aimed to test the effects of exposure to COVID-19-related stress on youth symptomatology. Further, in light of evidence suggesting that parents play an important role in buffering children from environmental stress, we assessed how specific parental behaviors (i.e., parental emotion socialization, maintenance of home routines, and availability to discuss the pandemic with child) contributed to effective parental buffering of the impact of pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Conversely, we tested whether parental anxiety-related symptomatology and parenting stress exacerbated the effect of children's exposure to pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Results suggest that parents who engaged in relatively higher levels of emotion coaching of children's negative emotions and who maintained more stable home routines during the pandemic were more effectively able to buffer the effects of pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Parents who reported higher levels of parenting stress and anxiety-related symptomatology were less likely to effectively buffer stress. Though interpretation of the findings is limited due to sole reliance on parental report and the cross-sectional study design due to the constraints of collecting data during a global pandemic, findings underscore the importance of assessing family-level factors when considering the impact of stressors on children's symptomatology and highlight the need to support parents during global events that place families under significant stress.","output":"Parental Buffering of Stress in the Time of COVID-19: Family-Level Factors May Moderate the Association Between Pandemic-Related Stress and Youth Symptomatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only affected health and economics, but also its effect extended to include other aspects, such as the environment. Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the countrys economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015-2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO(2) decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic.

There was a good agreement between PSG-derived AHI and WP-derived AHI (mean difference of AHI: -0.0213.2). Using a threshold of AHI 15 per hour of sleep, the sensitivity and specificity of the WP were 0.88 and 0.63, respectively. The overall accuracy in sleep staging between WP and PSG was 62% with Kappa agreement of 0.42. Conclusion WP can detect sleep apnea events in patients with AF. AF should not be an exclusion criterion for using the device. This finding may be of even greater importance in the era of the COVID19 epidemic, when sleep labs were closed and most studies were home based.","output":"Watch-PAT is Useful in the Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting the binding of viral peptides to the major histocompatibility complex with machine learning can potentially extend the computational immunology toolkit for vaccine development, and serve as a key component in the fight against a pandemic.

The etiology of IB was confirmed later as being due to a coronavirus: the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Being a coronavirus, IBV is subject to constant genome change due to mutation and recombination, with the consequence of changing clinical and pathological manifestations. The potential use of live attenuated vaccines for the control of IBV infection was demonstrated in the early 1950s, but vaccine breaks occurred due to the emergence of new IBV serotypes. Over the years, various IBV genotypes associated with reproductive, renal, gastrointestinal, muscular and immunosuppressive manifestations have emerged. IBV causes considerable economic impacts on global poultry production due to its pathogenesis involving multiple body systems and immune suppression; hence, there is a need to better understand the pathogenesis of infection and the immune response in order to help developing better management strategies. The evolution of new strains of IBV during the last nine decades against vaccine-induced immune response and changing clinical and pathological manifestations emphasize the necessity of the rational development of intervention strategies based on a thorough understanding of IBV interaction with the host.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Infection in Chickens: Multiple System Disease with Immune Suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections have been increasingly reported in fully vaccinated individuals. We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2, defined as 14 days after the second dose, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice between February 1, 2021 and August 22, 2021. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors. Taken together, these data constitute an early signal for waning protection against symptomatic illness while also providing reassurance that BNT162b2 continues to protect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection several months after full vaccination. Continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine durability, particularly against severe disease, is critical to guide effective and equitable strategies to respond to the pandemic, including distribution of booster doses, development of new vaccines, and implementation of both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Durability analysis of the highly effective BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize evidence on physical activity interventions that used wearables, either alone or in combination with education or rehabilitation, in adults following orthopaedic surgical procedures. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials of wearable-based interventions from each databases inception to August 2021 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Relevant outcomes included physical activity, physical function, pain, psychological distress, or general health. PEDro scale scoring ranges from 0 to 10 and was used to appraise studies as high (7), moderate (5C6), or poor (<5) quality. RESULTS: Of 335 articles identified, 6 articles met eligibility criteria. PEDro scores ranged from 2 to 6, with 3 studies of moderate quality and 3 of poor quality. Studies included patients undergoing total knee (number; n = 4) or total knee or hip (n = 1) arthroplasty and lumbar disc herniation surgery (n = 1). In addition to wearables, intervention components included step diary (n = 2), motivational interviewing (n = 1), goal setting (n = 2), tailored exercise program (n = 2), or financial incentives (n = 1). Interventions were delivered in-person (n = 2), remotely (n = 3) or in a hybrid format (n = 1). Intervention duration ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months. Compared to controls, 3 moderate quality studies reported greater improvement in steps/day; however, 1 moderate and 2 poor quality studies showed no between-group difference in physical function, pain, or quality of life. No serious adverse events related to the use of wearable were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of physical activity interventions using wearables, either delivered in-person or remotely, appear promising for increasing steps per day after joint arthroplasty; however, this finding should be viewed with caution since it is based on 3 moderate quality studies.

Moreover, mice lacking Kdm6b developed pathological autoimmune disorders. Mechanically, Kdm6b exerted its function by reducing repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the promoters of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 and a set of Aire-dependent TRA genes.

During an infection, the plasma level of iron and several iron-related proteins change substantially. We hypothesized that iron and iron-related proteins could predict short- and long-term outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS Blood samples from a prospective cohort of 267 in-patients with community-acquired pneumonia were analysed for hepcidin, ferritin, iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor at admission and 6-weeks post-discharge. Adverse short-term outcome was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death within 30 days, and long-term outcome was assessed as 5-year overall mortality. Logistic regression, Kaplan Meier survival curves, and Cox regression models with cut-offs at median for the potential biomarkers were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS Low admission levels of hepcidin predicted 5-year overall mortality, independently of age, sex, comorbid conditions, and anaemia. Low levels of ferritin at admission as well as low levels of iron and transferrin saturation and high levels of soluble transferrin receptor at the 6-week follow-up were predictors of 5-year overall mortality in univariable, but not in multivariable analyses. Neither of these potential biomarkers predicted adverse short-term outcomes.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, how to achieve effective traffic scheduling and macro command under less contact has attracted more attention. Therefore, the location estimation of traffic objectives is a key issue. In the developed framework, for the target parameter estimation in traffic, frequency diversity array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar is introduced into ITS, and tensor decomposition is used to process transportation big data (TBD) to improve the real-time performance of target location estimation. Unfortunately, spatial colored noise and array gain-phase error will affect the performance of FDA-MIMO radar in ITS. An algorithm that can solve the angle-range estimation problem of FDA-MIMO radar in the co-existence of array gain-phase error and spatial colored noise is proposed. Firstly, the four-dimensional tensor is constructed by using the temporal un-correlation of colored noise. Therefore, the influence of colored noise in ITS is removed. Secondly, the direction matrix containing target information is obtained by parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. For the array gain-phase error, the optimization problem is constructed, and the Lagrange multiplier is employed to calculate the optimal solution. The effect of gain-phase error is eliminated by utilizing the optimal solution and the direction matrices. Finally, the location information of motor vehicle is achieved by calculating the solution of least square (LS) fitting. The developed scheme can achieve the location information of motor vehicles in the co-existence of array gain-phase error and spatial colored noise. Comprehensive numerical experiments illustrate that the developed scheme in ITS can efficiently obtain the location information of motor vehicles.","output":"Traffic Target Location Estimation Based on Tensor Decomposition in Intelligent Transportation System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to increased telemedicine visits.

We believe that the scientific associations in the field of Occupational Hygiene play a crucial role in guiding and assisting prevention professionals. There is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science communities that can help employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of COVID-19.

A precise prognostic tool to identify poor outcomes among such cases is desperately needed. METHODS: Total 400 COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions were retrospectively recruited from 4 centers, including 54 dead cases (labeled as poor outcomes) and 346 patients discharged or hospitalized for at least 7 days since initial CT scan. Patients were allocated to a training set (n = 271), a test set (n = 68), and an external test set (n = 61). We proposed an initial CT-derived hybrid model by combining a 3D-ResNet10 based deep learning model and a quantitative 3D radiomics model to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients reaching poor outcome. The model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), survival analysis, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: The hybrid model achieved AUCs of 0.876 (95% confidence interval: 0.752-0.999) and 0.864 (0.766-0.962) in test and external test sets, outperforming other models.

However, this important aspect has not been clarified for the new pandemic human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 disease, despite it being one of the many respiratory viruses having the oropharynx as the primary site of replication. In particular, no data are available about the non-bacterial components of the HOM (fungi, viruses), which instead has been shown to be crucial for other diseases. Consistent with this, this study aimed to define the HOM in COVID-19 patients, to evidence any association between its profile and the clinical disease. Seventy-five oral rinse samples were analyzed by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to simultaneously identify oral bacteria, fungi, and viruses. To correlate the HOM profile with local virus replication, the SARS-CoV-2 amount in the oral cavity was quantified by digital droplet PCR. Moreover, local inflammation and secretory immune response were also assessed, respectively by measuring the local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (L-6, IL-17, TNF, and GM-CSF) and the production of secretory immunoglobulins A (sIgA). The results showed the presence of oral dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients compared to matched controls, with significantly decreased alpha-diversity value and lower species richness in COVID-19 subjects. Notably, oral dysbiosis correlated with symptom severity (p = 0.006), and increased local inflammation (p < 0.01). In parallel, a decreased mucosal sIgA response was observed in more severely symptomatic patients (p = 0.02), suggesting that local immune response is important in the early control of virus infection and that its correct development is influenced by the HOM profile. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that the HOM profile may be important in defining the individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, facilitating inflammation and virus replication, or rather, inducing a protective IgA response. Although it is not possible to determine whether the alteration in the microbial community is the cause or effect of the SARS-CoV-2 replication, these parameters may be considered as markers for personalized therapy and vaccine development.","output":"Oral Microbiome Dysbiosis Is Associated With Symptoms Severity and Local Immune/Inflammatory Response in COVID-19 Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Suicide is a global issue, with an estimated 75.5% of the cases occurring in developing countries, and India alone accounting for 26.6% of all global suicidal deaths.

The disease is claiming millions of lives worldwide, primarily in developing countries. In addition to vector control strategies, the most effective way to prevent the spread of ZIKV infection is vaccination. There is no clinically approved vaccine to combat ZIKV infection and curb its pandemic. An epitope-based peptide vaccine (EBPV) is seen as a powerful alternative to conventional vaccinations because of its low production cost and short production time. Nonetheless, EBPVs have gotten less attention, despite the fact that they have a significant untapped potential for enhancing vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and cross-reactivity. Such a vaccine technology is based on target pathogens selected antigenic peptides called T-cell epitopes (TCE), which are synthesized chemically based on their amino acid sequences. The identification of TCEs using wet-lab experimental approach is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. Therefore in this study, we present computational model for the prediction of ZIKV TCEs. The model proposed is an ensemble of decision trees that utilizes the physicochemical properties of amino acids. In this way a large amount of time and efforts would be saved for quick vaccine development. The peptide sequences dataset for model training was retrieved from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. The sequences dataset consist of experimentally verified T-cell epitopes (TCEs) and non-TCEs. The model demonstrated promising results when evaluated on test dataset. The evaluation metrics namely, accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, Gini and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) recorded values of 0.9789, 0.984, 0.981, 0.987, 0.974 and 0.948 respectively. The consistency and reliability of the model was assessed by carrying out the five (05)-fold cross-validation technique, and the mean accuracy of 0.97864 was reported. Finally, model was compared with standard machine learning (ML) algorithms and the proposed model outperformed all of them. The proposed model will aid in predicting novel and immunodominant TCEs of ZIKV. The predicted TCEs may have a high possibility of acting as prospective vaccine targets subjected to in-vivo and in-vitro scientific assessments, thereby saving lives worldwide, preventing future epidemic-scale outbreaks, and lowering the possibility of mutation escape.","output":"Decision tree based ensemble machine learning model for the prediction of Zika virus T-cell epitopes as potential vaccine candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused many hospitals and treatment centers to temporarily restrict or prohibit visitors to control viral spread.

As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","output":"Postoperative fever in the time of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundA novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and causes COVID-19, has resulted in worldwide human infections.

Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein.ResultsAn immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines.

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations.

We aimed to use an individual-based model to predict the impact of two possible strategies for reopening schools to all students in the UK from September, 2020, in combination with different assumptions about relaxation of physical distancing measures and the scale-up of testing. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used Covasim, a stochastic individual-based model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified into household, school, workplace, and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulated six different scenarios, representing the combination of two school reopening strategies (full time and a part-time rota system with 50% of students attending school on alternate weeks) and three testing scenarios (68% contact tracing with no scale-up in testing, 68% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave, and 40% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave). We estimated the number of new infections, cases, and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number (R) under different strategies. In a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated infectiousness of children and young adults aged younger than 20 years at 50% relative to older ages (20 years and older). FINDINGS: With increased levels of testing (between 59% and 87% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, depending on the scenario), and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented. Assuming 68% of contacts could be traced, we estimate that 75% of individuals with symptomatic infection would need to be tested and positive cases isolated if schools return full-time in September, or 65% if a part-time rota system were used. If only 40% of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87% and 75%, respectively. However, without these levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December, 2020, if schools open full-time in September, and in February, 2021, if a part-time rota system were adopted. In either case, the second wave would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting second wave of infections 20-23 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave. When infectiousness of children and young adults was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, we still found that a comprehensive and effective test-trace-isolate strategy would be required to avoid a second COVID-19 wave. INTERPRETATION: To prevent a second COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing, including reopening of schools, in the UK must be accompanied by large-scale, population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals.

The frequency and nature of human-rat encounters may be altered by social distancing policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, restaurant closures may reduce food availability for rats and promote rat activity in nearby residential areas, thus increasing public health risks during a period of public health crisis. In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with increased perceived exposure to rats during a stay-at-home order, describe residents encounters with rats relevant to their health and well-being, and identify factors associated with increased use of rodent control. METHODS: Urban residents in Chicago, a large city with growing concerns about rats and health disparities, completed an online questionnaire including fixed response and open-ended questions during the spring 2020 stay-at-home order. Analyses included ordinal multivariate regression, spatial analysis, and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of respondents (n = 835) reported an increase in rat sightings around their homes during the stay-at-home order and increased rat sightings was positively associated with proximity to restaurants, low-rise apartment buildings, and rat feces in the home (p  0.01). Many respondents described feeling unsafe using their patio or yard, and afraid of rats entering their home or spreading disease. Greater engagement with rodent control was associated with property ownership, information about rat control, and areas with lower incomes (p  0.01). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent rat encounters may be an unanticipated public health concern during periods of social distancing, especially in restaurant-dense areas or in low-rise apartment buildings. Rat presence may also limit residents ability to enjoy nearby outdoor spaces, which otherwise might buffer stress experienced during a stay-at-home order. Proactive rat control may be needed to mitigate rat-associated health risks during future stay-at-home orders.

This rapid scoping review addresses this gap, taking up a Latin American Social Medicine approach to assess the region's sociopolitical context and explore the extent to which Venezuelan migrants are considered in COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Latin America. Methods We conducted a three-phased rapid scoping review assessing peer-reviewed literature, gray literature, and government documents addressing COVID-19 vaccine access for displaced Venezuelans in Latin America. Documents published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese between January 2020 and June 2021 were included. Peer-reviewed literature search yielded 142 results and 13 articles included in the analysis;Gray literature screening resulted in 68 publications for full-text review and 37 were included;and official Ministry of Health policies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru were reviewed in-depth. Screening and data extraction used a combination of online platforms (Covidence, Google Forms, Zotero, and Excel) and the team met twice weekly to review, compare, discuss, analyse, and interpret data across a 6-week period. Findings Findings from country-level policies revealed a heterogeneous and shifting policy landscape amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which strongly juxtaposed calls for a rights-based, social justice approach to COVID-19 vaccination evidenced in the peer-reviewed and gray literature. For example, under extreme resource constraints resulting from a chronically underfunded health system and mass Venezuelan migration. Colombia's vaccination plan excluded migrants with irregular migration status. Countries prioritised COVID-19 vaccines to certain at-risk groups defined by individual epidemiological factors rather than social vulnerability, limiting vaccine access for displaced Venezuelans in the region. Country-level policies differentiated, at times arbitrarily, between refugees, irregular migrants, and regular migrants, with important implications for vaccine access. While international right to health legislation prohibits discrimination based on migration status and urges states to refrain from denying access to preventive health services, these results suggest the need for further guidance on terminology to better contend with migrants' social vulnerabilities. Interpretation COVID-19 is rapidly evolving and there is an urgent need for rights-based approaches to vaccination that consider sociopolitical contexts, especially impacts of mass migration. Findings underscore the need to better integrate Venezuelan migrants into vaccination strategies, not only as a matter of social justice, but a pragmatic public health strategy.

In this analysis we examined community-level differences across the city of Chicago to better understand how geographic differences are associated with COVID19 mortality. Hypothesis: We hypothesized there would be an association between higher community-level social vulnerability and COVID19 mortality rates. Methods: We examined publicly available data from the Cook County Medical Examiner data (Illinois) of all known COVID-19 deaths as of August 21, 2020. Decedent addresses (N = 2397) were restricted to the city of Chicago, geocoded, and classified according to the 77 recognized community areas in the city. Poisson regression models were used to determine significant community-level predictors of COVID19 mortality based on community-level demographic, social, health, and healthcare characteristics collected from the Chicago Health Atlas. Results: There was at least one COVID19-related death in each Chicago community area, with a crude mortality rate ranging from 0.571-24.5 deaths per 10,000 persons. In the fully adjusted model with 14 community-level predictors, higher community-level population density, percentage of males, living in crowded housing, and limited food access were associated with higher rates of COVID19 mortality. Higher community-level proportion of the population aged 65+ years and havinga primary care provider were associated with lower COVID19 mortality. Differences by Black and Latinx race/ethnicity community-level demographics were not significant in the final model.

Although remarkable progress in SEs has been achieved and has resulted in high ionic conductivity, which now reaches values comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, the typical use of a slurry process for the fabrication of conventional ASSBs inevitably causes harmful reactions between sulfide materials and polar solvents. Here, we studied the efficient infiltration process of SE slurry into conventional composite LIB electrodes (NCM622) for achieving high-energy-density ASSBs via a scalable solution-based fabrication process. Two methods are proposed to ensure that SE materials are evenly distributed and sufficiently infiltrated into the porous structures of LIB electrodes. The LPSCl SE solutions were effectively infiltrated into the electrodes at higher processing temperatures and the temperature was subsequently optimized at above the boiling point of the ethanol solvent due to the dynamic motion of SE molecules via a convective flow during solvent vaporization. Moreover, the porous LIB composite electrodes with a mixture of active materials of different particle sizes formed and filled capillary pores resulting in a high electrode density. The LPSCl SE-infiltrated NCM622 electrodes that used this strategy could remarkably improve the initial discharge capacity of ASSBs to as high as 177 mAh/g. These ASSBs also showed excellent performance even at high loading values (about 17 mg/cm2), making them competitive with LIBs using conventional liquid electrolytes.","output":"Facile fabrication of solution-processed solid-electrolytes for high-energy-density all-solid-state-batteries by enhanced interfacial contact."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the late autumn of 2019, a new potentially lethal human coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV-2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found.

An online survey tool that included validated measures of adolescents' MVPA and socio-environmental, potential confounders was administered to youths (e.g., lack of classmates, motivation, possibility of choosing any physical exercise time, possibility of choosing your own exercises, home environment). The analytic sample comprised 127 adolescents aged 15.4  0.5 years on average (52% girls and 48% boys). The results highlight that among adolescents who did not meet the WHO MVPA recommendations before the lockdown, 13.4% had an increased frequency of PA (from 2.9 to 5.4 day/week) (p = 0.01) during the lockdown. In the group who did meet these recommendations before the lockdown, 50% significantly decreased their level of MVPA below the WHO's recommendations (p = 0.01). Self-rated health for PA showed a significantly strong correlation with MVPA in the group of students who met the WHO recommendations before the pandemic (r = 0.76; p < 0.05) but failed to maintain that recommendation during the COVID-19 restriction. The results suggest a negative impact of the pandemic on PA undertaken by youths.

Recommendations from WHO and specialists insist on testing on a mass scale. However, health systems do not have enough resources. The current process requires the isolation of testees in the hospitals isolation rooms for several hours until the test results are revealed, limiting hospitals capacities to test large numbers of cases. The aim of this paper was to estimate the impact of reducing the COVID-19 test time on controlling the pandemic spread, through increasing hospitals capacities to test on a mass scale. First, a discrete-event simulation was used to model and simulate the COVID-19 testing process in Morocco. Second, a mathematical model was developed to demonstrate the effect of accurate identification of infected cases on controlling the diseases spread. Simulation results showed that hospitals testing capacities could be increased six times if the test duration fell from 10 hours to 10 minutes. The reduction of test time would increase testing capacities, which help to identify all the infected cases. In contrast, the simulation results indicated that if the infected population is not accurately identified and no precautionary measures are taken, the virus will continue to spread until it reaches the total population. Reducing test time is a vital component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because there is no specific therapeutic drug, drug repurposing has been proposed. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control its replication, and several compounds have been suggested. The present study predicts relative efficacies of thirty known or repurposed compounds in inhibiting the RdRp. Methods: The three-dimensional structure of the target enzyme was loaded into Molegro virtual docker software, followed by chemical structures of the test compounds. The docking was performed between the compounds and the active site of the enzyme to determine docking scores, and the energy liberated when the two dock. Thus, docking scores signify the affinity of ligand(s) with the active site of enzyme(s) and thus its inhibitory potential. Results: Among known inhibitors, remdesivir was found to have the highest affinity for the active site of the RdRp. Among all compounds, chlorhexidine was predicted as the most potent inhibitor. Furthermore, the results predict the relative efficacy of different drugs as inhibitors of the drug target. Conclusion: While the study identifies several compounds as inhibitors of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, the prediction of their relative efficacies may be useful in future studies. While nucleoside analogs compete with the natural substrate of RdRp, thereby terminating RNA replication, other compounds would physically block entry of the natural substrates into the active site.

Effectively synchronizing behavioral measures such as meal micro-structure (e.g., eating speed), cognitive processing of sensory stimuli, and metabolic parameters, can be complex. However, this step is central to understanding the impact of food interventions on body weight. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing gaps in eating behavior research and describe the development and validation of a new methodological platform to address some of these issues. As part of a controlled trial, 76 men and women self-served and consumed food from a buffet, using a portion-control plate with visual stimuli for appropriate amounts of main food groups, or a conventional plate, on two different days, in a random order. In both sessions participants completed behavioral and cognitive tests using a novel methodological platform that measured gaze movement (as a proxy for visual attention), eating rate and bite size, memory for portion sizes, subjective appetite and portion-size perceptions. In a sub-sample of women, hormonal secretion in response to the meal was also measured. The novel platform showed a significant improvement in meal micro-structure measures from published data (13 vs. 33% failure rate) and high comparability between an automated gaze mapping protocol vs. manual coding for eye-tracking studies involving an eating test (ICC between methods 0.85; 90% CI 0.74, 0.92).

Nature has been considered as the historical trove of drug discovery and development, particularly in cases of worldwide crises. Herein, a comprehensive in silico investigation of a highly focused chemical library of 34 pederin-structurally related marine compounds, belonging to four polyketides families, was initiated against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro, being the key replicating element of the virus and main target in many drugs development programs. Two of the most potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro co-crystallized inhibitors, O6K and N3, were added to the tested database as reference standards.

Thermodynamic behaviors of the identified compounds were investigated through 200 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation illustrating their significant stability and pocket accommodation. Furthermore, structural activity preferentiality was identified for the pederin-based marine compounds highlighting the importance of the terminal guanidine and cyclic hemiacetal linker, and the length of the sidechain.

The challenge of effective epidemic control is to achieve a balance between viral transmission reduction and economic cost. This paper then summarizes three main methods to evaluate the effectiveness of several control policies.

However, the impact of viral infections on adult pneumonia mortality remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the effect of virus infection on pneumonia mortality among adults stratified by virus type and patient comorbidities. METHODS: This multicentre prospective study enrolled pneumonia patients aged 15 years from September 2011 to August 2014. Sputum samples were tested by in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Viral infection status and its effect on in-hospital mortality were examined by age group and comorbidity status. RESULTS: A total of 2617 patients were enrolled in the study and 77.8% was aged 65 years. 574 (21.9%) did not have comorbidities, 790 (30.2%) had chronic respiratory disease, and 1253 (47.9%) had other comorbidities. Viruses were detected in 605 (23.1%) patients. Human rhinovirus (9.8%) was the most frequently identified virus, followed by influenza A (3.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (3.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently identified in patients with chronic respiratory disease (4.7%) than those with other comorbidities (4.2%) and without comorbidities (2.1%) (p = 0.037). The frequencies of other viruses were almost identical between the three groups. Virus detection overall was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.53C1.09). However, influenza virus A and B were associated with three-fold higher mortality in patients with chronic respiratory disease but not with other comorbidities (ARR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54C7.42). Intriguingly, paramyxoviruses were associated with dramatically lower mortality in patients with other comorbidities (ARR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01C0.70) but not with chronic respiratory disease.

METHODS: From July 8th to August 18th, 2020, we conducted a comprehensive state-wide survey of all eight OTPs that dispense methadone in Connecticut to examine programmatic changes during COVID-19. We also analyzed state-level data on confirmed accidental opioid-involved deaths to assess if relaxation of take-home dosing restrictions and in-person attendance requirements correlated with increased methadone-involved fatal overdose rates. RESULTS: OTPs reported implementing multiple changes to methadone treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percent of patients receiving 28-day take-home doses increased from 0.1% to 16.8%, 14-day take-home doses increased from 14.2% to 26.8%, and the percent receiving one or no take-home doses decreased from 37.5% to 9.6%.

However, changes to methadone treatment varied considerably by program. OTP providers said restrictions on methadone should be relaxed and increases in take-home dosing as well as telehealth should be continued in non-pandemic situations. Methadone-involved fatalities relative to other opioid-involved fatalities did not increase in Connecticut following changes in OTP practices.

Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science.

As a consequence of the lockdown, many businesses shutdown and effectively had no source of revenue. Yet, without receiving any bailout or palliatives from the government, these businesses are required to meet their tax obligations to the government. Bearing in mind that this time (COVID-19 era) is different, one wonders what is required of businesses in view of the taxation problem and the social contract between the businesspersons and the government. In view of social contract obligations, in this COVID-19 pandemic should businesses pay tax to a government that seems to have delegitimised itself by its exploitative actions in terms of taxation and delinquent omission in terms of the provision of public goods and social services? The Nigerian government at all tiers (federal, state and local) seldom respect the essence of taxation. Therefore, businesses often pay tax for nothing. For many businesses, as far as taxation is concerned, to pay or not to pay? that is the question. This article is aimed at teasing out this taxation problem that may or may not be a moral dilemma. In view of certain ethical considerations, this article shows why in spite of social contract obligations, there is no consensus or canonical agreement on whether, as law-abiding citizens and juridical persons (legal entities), businesspersons and businesses ought to or ought not to pay tax to the Nigerian government in this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Taxation in the COVID-19 Pandemic: to Pay or Not to Pay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We aimed to assess whether home collection and increased time to semen processing are associated with altered sperm parameters, fertilization rates (FR), day 5 usable quality blastocyst development rates (D5-UQBR), or pregnancy rates (PR) in patients undergoing IVF/ICSI. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing IVF/ICSI before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (\\"clinic\\" collection, n = 119) and after COVID-19 (\\"home\\" collection, n = 125) at an academic fertility practice. Home collection occurred within 2 h of semen processing. Patient sperm parameters, FR (#2PN/MII), D5-UQBR (# transferable and freezable quality blastocysts/# 2PN), and PR in fresh transfer cycles were compared between clinic and home groups with t-tests. The association between time to processing on outcomes was assessed with regression modeling, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean male age was 37.9 years in the clinic group and 37.2 years in the home group (p = 0.380). On average, men were abstinent for 3.0 days (SD 1.7) in the clinic group and 4.1 days (SD 5.4) in the home group (p = 0.028). Mean time to semen processing was 35.7 min (SD 9.4) in the clinic group and 82.6 min (SD 33.8) in the home group (p < 0.001). There was no association between collection location and increased time to processing on sperm motility, total motile count, FR, D5-UQBR, or PR.

Nevertheless, the data on optimal fluid management strategies for those who develop critical illness remain sparse. Adding to the challenge, the fluid volume status of these patients has been found to be dynamic. Some present with several days of malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and consequent hypovolemia requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation, while a subset develop acute respiratory distress syndrome with renal dysfunction and lingering congestion necessitating restrictive fluid management. Accurate objective assessment of volume status allows physicians to tailor the fluid management goals throughout this wide spectrum of critical illness. Conventional point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) enables the reliable assessment of fluid status and reducing the staff exposure. However, due to specific characteristics of COVID-19 (e.g., rapidly expanding lung lesions), a single imaging method such as lung POCUS will have significant limitations. Herein, we suggest a Tri-POCUS approach that represents concurrent bedside assessment of the lungs, heart, and the venous system.

According to theories of memory consolidation, memories are gradually reorganized, becoming supported by widespread, distributed cortical networks, particularly during postencoding periods of sleep. However, the effects of sleep on the organization of memories in the hippocampus itself remains less clear. In a 3-d study, participants encoded separate lists of word-image pairs differing in their opportunity for sleep-dependent consolidation. Pairs were initially studied either before or after an overnight sleep period, and were then restudied in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan session. We used multivariate pattern similarity analyses to examine fine-grained effects of consolidation on memory representations in the hippocampus. We provide evidence for a dissociation along the long axis of the hippocampus that emerges with consolidation, such that representational patterns for object-word memories initially formed prior to sleep become differentiated in anterior hippocampus and more similar, or overlapping, in posterior hippocampus. Differentiation in anterior hippocampal representations correlated with subsequent behavioral performance. Furthermore, representational overlap in posterior hippocampus correlated with the duration of intervening slow wave sleep. Together, these results demonstrate that sleep-dependent consolidation promotes the reorganization of memory traces along the long axis of the hippocampus.","output":"Time-dependent transformations of memory representations differ along the long axis of the hippocampus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toplumlar belirli d?nemlerde birtak?m zorluklarla kar??la?abilirler Bu tr zorluklar ekonomik, politik, kltrel, toplum sa[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]l gibi durumlar ile ilgili olabilir Kar??la??lan her zorlu[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]un toplumun, bireylerin zerinde birtak?m etkileri olaca?? a?ikard?r Bu etkilerin bireylerin davran??lar?nda de[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]i?iklikler ile sonu?lanmas? muhtemeldir Son zamanlarda Trkiye'yi ve tm dnyay? etkileyen Covid-19 salg?n? ile kar?? kar??ya kal?nm??t?r Salg?n sresince tketicilerin ihtiya?lar?nda, faaliyetlerinde, tketim davran??lar?nda de[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]i?imler ya?anmaya ba?lam??t?r Bu tr de[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]i?imleri anlayabilmek, salg?n sreci ve sonras?nda tketicilere ??zmler retebilmek ad?na, kapsaml? bilgi sunacak olan ya?am tarz? ara?t?rmas? ?nemli olmaktad?r B?ylelikle tketici davran??lar?na dair detayl? bilgiler elde edilerek, toplumsal e[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]ilimlere dair fikirler edinilebilir Bu ara?t?rmada Covid-19 sreci ve sonras?na dair tketici davran??lar?ndaki e[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]ilimler ya?am tarz? bak?? a??s?yla kavramsal bir ?er?evede de[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]erlendirilmektedir De[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]erlendirme sonucunda, Covid-19 srecinde tketicilerin temel ihtiya?lara y?neldikleri, ?evrimi?i al??veri?in artt, dijital platformlar? daha fazla kulland?klar&0131;, firmalar?n kurumsal sosyal sorumluluk projelerine ?zel ?nem verdikleri s?ylenebilir Bu tr e[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]ilimlerin uzun d?nemli olmas? halinde tketicilerin ya?am tarzlar?nda de[LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER G WITH CARON]i?iklikler olmas? beklenmektedir Alternate abstract:Societies can encounter some difficulties at certain times Such difficulties can be related to economic, political, cultural and public health situations It is a fact that every challenge encountered will have some impact on society, individuals These effects are likely to result in changes in individuals' behavior Covid-19 outbreak affecting the whole world and Turkey has emerged recently Changes in the needs, activities and consumption behaviors of consumers have started to occur during the outbreak Lifestyle research that will provide comprehensive information is important in order to understand such changes and to offer solutions to consumers during and after the outbreak Thus ideas about social trends can be obtained by gathering detailed information about consumer behavior In this study, the trends in consumer behavior regarding the Covid-19 process and beyond are evaluated in a conceptual framework from lifestyle perspective As a result, it can be said that in the process of Covid-19, consumers tend to basic needs, increase online shopping, use digital platforms more, and give particular importance to companies' corporate social responsibility projects If such trends are long-term, it is expected that there will be changes in the lifestyle of consumers","output":"COVID-19 SRECNDE VE POST-PANDEM D?NEMNDE YA?AM TARZI A?ISINDAN TKETC DAVRANI?LARININ DE??EN E?LM ZERNE KAVRAMSAL BR ?ALI?MA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organic small molecules that can recognize and bind to G-quadruplex and i-Motif nucleic acids have great potential as selective drugs or as tools in drug target discovery programs, or even in the development of nanodevices for medical diagnosis.

The aim of this study is to investigate opportunities, barriers, acceptance, and preferences concerning telemedicine among RMD patients and professional stakeholders. From November 2017 to December 2019, a participatory, mixed-methods study was conducted, consisting of (1) expert interviews (n = 27) with RMD patients and professional stakeholders, (2) a national paper-based patient survey (n = 766), and (3) focus groups (n = 2) with patient representatives and rheumatologists. The qualitative findings indicate that patients equate personal contact with physical face-to-face contact, which could be reduced by implementing telemedicine, thus negatively influencing the patientCdoctor relationship. Correspondingly no personal contact with the doctor is the main reason (64%) why 38% of the surveyed patients refuse to try telemedicine. Professional stakeholders expect telemedicine to contribute to the effective allocation of scarce resources in rheumatology care. The main barriers reported by stakeholders were the scarcity of time resources in RMD care, the absence of physical examinations, and organizational challenges associated with the implementation of telemedicine in RMD care.

Vaccines based on live attenuated viruses seem to be most effective for vaccination against challenging pathogens like Cyprinid herpesvirus 3. However, there are still knowledge gaps how these vaccines effectively protect fish from the deadly disease caused by the epitheliotropic CyHV-3, and which aspects of non-direct protection of skin or gill integrity and function are important in the aquatic environment. To elucidate some elements of protection, common carp were vaccinated against CyHV-3 using a double deletion vaccine virus KHV-T DUT/TK in the absence or presence of a mix of common carp beta-defensins 1, 2 and 3 as adjuvants. Vaccination induced marginal clinical signs, low virus load and a minor upregulation of cd4, cd8 and igm gene expression in vaccinated fish, while neutralisation activity of blood serum rose from 14 days post vaccination (dpv). A challenge infection with CyHV-3 induced a severe disease with 80-100% mortality in non-vaccinated carp, while in vaccinated carp, no mortality was recorded and the virus load was >1,000-fold lower in the skin, gill and kidney. Histological analysis showed strongest pathological changes in the skin, with a complete destruction of the epidermis in non-vaccinated carp. In the skin of non-vaccinated fish, T and B cell responses were severely downregulated, inflammation and stress responses were increased upon challenge, whereas vaccinated fish had boosted neutrophil, T and B cell responses. A disruption of skin barrier elements (tight and adherence junction, desmosomes, mucins) led to an uncontrolled increase in skin bacteria load which most likely exacerbated the inflammation and the pathology. Using a live attenuated virus vaccine, we were able to show that increased neutrophil, T and B cell responses provide protection from CyHV-3 infection and lead to preservation of skin integrity, which supports successful protection against additional pathogens in the aquatic environment which foster disease development in non-vaccinated carp.","output":"Don't Let It Get Under Your Skin! - Vaccination Protects the Skin Barrier of Common Carp From Disruption Caused by Cyprinid Herpesvirus 3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is one of the important pathogens in infant respiratory tract infection.

OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise five widely used eHealth applications, in relation to safe, evidence-based and high-quality eHealth. Using these applications as examples, we aim to increase understanding of eHealth among GPs and highlight the opportunities and challenges presented by eHealth. DISCUSSION: eHealth applications can support patients while increasing efficiency for GPs. A three-way division (inform, monitor, track; interaction; data utilisation) characterises many eHealth applications, with an increasing degree of complexity depending on the domain. All applications provide information and some have extra functionalities that promote interaction, while data analysis and artificial intelligence may be applied to support or (fully) automate care processes. Applications in the inform domain are relatively easy to use and implement but their impact on clinical outcomes may be limited. More demanding applications, in terms of privacy and ethical aspects, are found in the data utilisation domain and may potentially have a more significant impact on care processes and patient outcomes.

A pooled testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 has theoretically been shown to increase the testing capacity of a country, especially when applied in low prevalence settings. Experimental studies have shown that the sensitivity of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is not affected when implemented in small groups. Previous models estimated the optimum group size as a function of the historical prevalence; however, this implies a homogeneous distribution of the disease within the population. This study aimed to explore whether separating individuals by age groups when pooling samples results in any further savings on test kits or affects the optimum group size estimation compared to Dorfman's pooling, based on historical prevalence. For this evaluation, age groups of interest were defined as 0-19 years, 20-59 years and over 60 years old. Generalisation of Dorfman's pooling was performed by adding statistical weight to the age groups based on the number of confirmed cases and tests performed in the segment.

Conversely, the interaction of S with the M protein, essential for VLP incorporation of S, was not impaired by lack of palmitoylation. Thus, palmitoylation of the S protein of Alphacoronaviruses is dispensable for SCM interaction, but required for the generation of progeny virions.","output":"Palmitoylation of the Alphacoronavirus TGEV spike protein S is essential for incorporation into virus-like particles but dispensable for SCM interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) functions as cap-independent translation initiation sites in eukaryotic cells.

We aimed to quantify the prevalence of mask-related cutaneous side effects and the differences between CE and non-CE approved masks. METHODS In this multicenter prospective observational study conducted from March 20, 2020 to May 12, 2020(during and after quarantine), patients attending emergency departments for a dermatological consult were clinically assessed and their masks were inspected to detect CE marks and UNI (Italian National Unification Entity) norms. Patients with history of facial dermatoses or under current treatment for facial dermatoses were excluded. RESULTS We enrolled 412 patients (318 during quarantine and 94 after quarantine). CE-approved masks were observed 52.8% vs. 24.5%, whilst subsets of non-CE approved masks were 9.7% vs. 14.9% (Personal protective equipment (PPE)-masks), 16.4% vs. 12.8% (surgical masks [SM]), and 21.1% vs. 47.9%(non-PPE) and (non-SM masks), respectively during and after quarantine. Remarkably, non-CE-approved masks resulted in patients displaying a statistically significant higher incidence of facial dermatoses and irritant contact dermatitis compared to CE-approved masks, and these differences were mainly driven by non-PPE non-SM masks. Comparing quarantine and after quarantine periods, no statistically significant differences were found for CE-approved masks, whilst differences were detected in non-CE-approved masks regarding incidence of facial dermatoses (P<0.0001)and irritant contact dermatitis (P=0.0041). CONCLUSIONS Masks are essential to prevent COVID-19 but at the same time higher awareness regarding mask specifications should be promoted in the general population.

Its role in blood oxygenation has been well documented. However, the effects on myocardial electrophysiology have not been studied in detail. AIM: To reveal the acute effects of extracorporeal support on new electrocardiography (ECG) parameters in patients with preserved left ventricular functions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in three separate clinics. Sixteen consecutive patients under veno-venous ECMO for respiratory insufficiency who soon could be successfully weaned were analyzed. Immediately before and 2 hours after initiation of ECMO, ECG was performed. P wave, QT, QTc and T wave peak to end were measured and calculated from obtained surface 12-lead ECG. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences immediately before and 2 hours after initiation of ECMO treatment in the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QTc ratio, the maximum QTc, minimum QTc, and QTc dispersion values, and P wave dispersion (p < 0.0001 for each). All ECG parameters were significantly decreased with ECMO support. CONCLUSIONS: All atrial and ventricular repolarization parameters were decreased in patients with VV-ECMO support. Despite the limited role of ECMO in intractable arrhythmias, the findings of the study revealed that ECMO therapy for respiratory insufficiency may improve atrial ventricular depolarization and repolarization.

CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old gentleman presented locally in August 2020 with erythema over the anterolateral surface of his left leg. He was initially treated with antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. Within a few days this lesion became necrotic and rapidly spread. At this point, he was transferred to a tertiary rheumatology centre. Within days to weeks, he developed several necrotic lesions affecting his trunk and limbs, with facial sparing noted. Approximately 3035% of his whole-body surface became involved. He soon developed an oxygen requirement, with CTPA demonstrating lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis without evidence of pulmonary emboli (PE). Throughout his admission, he had several other pathologies such as hyponatraemia that required level 2 care and severe non-infectious diarrhoea. Skin biopsy identified thrombotic vasculopathy. Serology confirmed triple positive antiphospholipid antibody status and a dsDNA titre of > 400 iU/mL. This was the first-time serology had been undertaken despite a history of three deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episodes and two PE incidents. He had no history of SLE symptoms. His initial management for vasculitis secondary to APLS at the point of limited necrosis consisted of IV methylprednisolone followed by rituximab and PO prednisolone. While there was some delay in the progression of his disease, new areas of necrosis arose, leading to the patient receiving cyclophosphamide. Low molecular weight heparin was used for anticoagulation. This gentleman later developed proteinuria and neurological symptoms, fulfilling the criteria for catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. He received plasma exchange, without an improvement. He developed complications from his disease and treatment, including poor wound healing. It became apparent his condition would not improve and active treatments were stopped. He passed away 6 weeks after initial presentation. Prior to his admission to hospital, his warfarin was swapped to a NOAC. This is thought to have been the trigger behind catastrophic thrombosis. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: After excluding other conditions such as necrotising fasciitis, this gentleman was rapidly started on IV methylprednisolone to halt any further progression. This is because glucocorticoids have the greatest evidence base for managing this poorly understood acute disease manifestation. After this failed to manage his condition, he was given a further immunosuppressive agent in the form of rituximab. This was used after his serology confirmed triple antibody status. It was hoped this would stop any further immunological mediated disease progression. Oral prednisolone was started at 40 mg at this stage and kept under review with a tapering schedule. Cyclophosphamide was given within a few days of rituximab, with hope of a quicker onset of action. A careful MDT decision was made on these drug choices, particularly regarding their combined use and appreciating their side effect profiles. Cyclophosphamide has evidence behind its use, especially for those with APLS associated with lupus. While he did not develop any infections related to treatment, his condition progressed. Case reports suggest that plasma exchange can be useful in the management of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, so the team recommended this. Consent at this stage became tricky due to his altered mental status, but it was felt he did demonstrate capacity for this specific decision. As his condition did not improve after this level of immunosuppression, the team reached the decision that no other treatments would likely change the outcome. He remained on oral steroids for the remainder of his admission. The other management facet of APLS crises pertains to anticoagulation. Low molecular weight heparin was recommended by the haematologists. His NOAC was stopped after the diagnosis was confirmed. Warfarin was restarted later in his admission given he had been well on this for years. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: This fascinating case exemplifies the importance of completing an antiphospholipid antibody screen for patients who present with unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease. NOACs are commonly used anticoagulant medications. Several case reports have demonstrated that patients with antiphospholipid syndrome experience breakthrough thromboembolic events when treated with NOACs. The highest risk is associated with history of arterial thrombosis and those with triple positive antibody status. Three clinical trials have either been completed or are in the process of investigating whether NOACs sufficiently prevent thromboembolic disease in these patients. The TRAPS study compared rivaroxaban to warfarin in those with triple antibody positive antiphospholipid syndrome. The study was terminated early given that higher adverse events were observed in the rivaroxaban arm (19%, n = 11/59) versus warfarinised patients (3%, n = 2/61). The RAPS study found no difference in thromboembolic risk and results from the ASTRO-APS study looking into apixaban are awaited. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that NOACs prevent VTE in a similar fashion to warfarin, so many still advocate the use of warfarin. The optimal immune management of this acute complication is not well elucidated, with a shortfall in mechanistic pathological understanding. The conference will generate discussion on this subject matter in detail. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been observed for patients to change anticoagulation from warfarin to NOACs. Given NOACs do not require monitoring, this medication change reduces the number of interactions patients have with healthcare services. We postulate this change triggered the crisis in our patient, where we suggest continuation of warfarin would have been ideal. This is due to the history of several unprovoked thromboembolic events without a prior antiphospholipid screen being completed. Dissemination of learning points from this case are imperative to ensure decision-making encompasses patients who may have undiagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome.","output":"O25 Catastrophic antiphospholipid crisis triggered by anticoagulant switch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the letter titled \\"Is the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in solid organ transplant recipients really similar to that of the general population?\\" by Mendoza et al. regarding our recently published paper.

The aim was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 health crisis on patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 29 adult CIDP patients was performed. The Medical Research Council scale was used to evaluate muscle strength. The degree of functional disability was measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale. The overall quality of life (QoL) was self-estimated on a 0-100 numeric rating scale. We also used a specifically designed 22-question-survey about COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% of CIDP patients were concerned. The daily activities of 55% of patients were negatively influenced by the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 21% of patients reported their CIDP got worse. In 39% of CIDP patients, the influence of the pandemic on CIDP therapy was reported (reducing the dose or time interval or even discontinuation). The mean value of the self-estimated QoL was 64  19.

However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self-assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior.

The self-assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface-bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self-complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP-9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size-induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self-assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway.

There is little existing literature on the efficacy of prehospital COVID-19 screening tools. The objective of this study was to determine the positive and negative predictive value of an emergency infectious disease surveillance tool for detecting COVID-19 patients and the impact of positive screening on PPE usage. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of prehospital care reports and hospital electronic health records. We abstracted records for all 911 calls to an urban EMS from March 1CJuly 31, 2020 that had a documented positive screen for COVID-19 and/or had a positive COVID-19 test. The dispatch screen solicited information regarding travel, sick contacts, and high-risk symptoms. We reviewed charts to determine dispatch-screening results, the outcome of patients COVID-19 testing, and documentation of crew fidelity to PPE guidelines. RESULTS: The sample size was 263. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests for all-comers in the state of Massachusetts was 2.0%. The dispatch screen had a sensitivity of 74.9% (confidence interval [CI], 69.21C80.03) and a specificity of 67.7% (CI, 66.91C68.50). The positive predictive value was 4.5% (CI, 4.17C4.80), and the negative predictive value was 99.3% (CI, 99.09C99.40). The most common symptom that triggered a positive screen was shortness of breath (51.5% of calls). The most common high-risk population identified was skilled nursing facility patients (19.5%), but most positive tests did not belong to a high-risk population (58.1%). The EMS personnel were documented as wearing full PPE for the patient in 55.7% of encounters, not wearing PPE in 8.0% of encounters, and not documented in 27.9% of encounters. CONCLUSION: This dispatch-screening questionnaire has a high negative predictive value but moderate sensitivity and therefore should be used with some caution to guide EMS crews in their PPE usage. Clinical judgment is still essential and may supersede screening status.","output":"A Dispatch Screening Tool to Identify Patients at High Risk for COVID-19 in the Prehospital Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nasal epithelium expressing enriched angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the key cell entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), could serve as the first barrier to protect the airway from viral infection.

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive COVID-19 hospitalized patients confirmed by a reverse transcription chain reaction in 11 medical institutions in Fukui, Japan. We developed and validated seven machine-learning models (e.g., penalized logistic regression model) using routinely collected data (e.g., demographics, simple blood test). The primary outcome was the need for oxygen therapy (1 L/min or SpO(2)  94%) during hospitalization. C-statistics, calibration slope, and association measures (e.g., sensitivity) evaluated the performance of the model using the test set (randomly selected 20% of data for internal validation). Among these seven models, the machine-learning model that showed the best performance was re-evaluated using an external dataset. We compared the model performances using the A-DROP criteria (modified version of CURB-65) as a conventional method. RESULTS: Of the 396 patients with COVID-19 for the model development, 102 patients (26%) required oxygen therapy during hospitalization.

However, the optimal surgical margin is still under debate. Precancerous lesions exist in tumor-adjacent tissues beyond the histological margin. However, potential precancerous epigenetic variation patterns beyond the histological margin of pGGO are yet to be discovered and described. RESULTS: A genome-wide high-resolution DNA methylation analysis was performed on samples collected from 15 pGGO at tumor core (TC), tumor edge (TE), para-tumor tissues at the 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm beyond the tumor, and peripheral normal (PN) tissue. TC and TE were tested with the same genetic alterations, which were also observed in histologically normal tissue at 5 mm in two patients with lower mutation allele frequency. According to the difference of methylation profiles between PN samples, 2284 methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs), 1657 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs), and 713 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Two different patterns of methylation markers were observed: Steep (S) markers sharply changed at 5 mm beyond the histological margin, and Gradual (G) markers changed gradually from TC to PN. S markers composed 86.2% of the tumor-related methylation markers, and G markers composed the other 13.8%. S-marker-associated genes enriched in GO terms that were related to the hallmarks of cancer, and G-markers-associated genes enriched in pathways of stem cell pluripotency and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Significant difference in DNA methylation score was observed between peripheral normal tissue and tumor-adjacent tissues 5 mm further from the histological margin (p < 0.001 in MHB markers). DNA methylation score at and beyond 10 mm from histological margin is not significantly different from peripheral normal tissues (p > 0.05 in all markers). CONCLUSIONS: According to the methylation pattern observed in our study, it was implied that methylation alterations were not significantly different between tissues at or beyond P10 and distal normal tissues. This finding explained for the excellent prognosis from radical resections with surgical margins of more than 15 mm. The inclusion of epigenetic characteristics into surgical margin analysis may yield a more sensitive and accurate assessment of remnant cancerous and precancerous cells in the surgical margins.

Prior to the pandemic, a significant focus was placed on the application of a social model of care within nursing homes. We know that COVID-19 has required the stringent application of infection prevention and control measures as well as the provision of increased amounts of clinical care. This has resulted in the recent stronger application of a medical model of care within nursing homes. METHODS: A roundtable event attended by twenty-six people took place. Attendees represented clinical Gerontology, the Irish College of General Practitioner, Sage Family Forum, The Health Information and Quality Authority, Nursing Homes Ireland and nursing home providers. A number of presentations were made, and a roundtable discussion took place about the model of nursing home care post pandemic. Key messages from presentations and the discussion were captured. A report was compiled and shared with attendees to check for accuracy. RESULTS: The following key messages were identified: 1. Social care is a cornerstone of nursing home care 2. Increased integration of nursing homes within the wider health and social care system is required 3. Increased access to services for nursing home residents is required 4. Regulatory reform is required 5. Resourcing of nursing home care needs to be appropriately addressed 6. The nursing home sector need to be included in conversations around policy and service development affecting nursing home care in Ireland. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes are an essential part of the healthcare system in Ireland and have been shown to be adaptable throughout the course of the pandemic.

To mitigate the risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), intravenous daratumumab administration requires 7 hours for the first infusion and 3.5-4 hours thereafter, thus making daratumumab-containing regimens burdensome for patients and health care resources. Preliminary data suggest that a rapid (90-minute) infusion of daratumumab is safe and does not increase IRRs. The rapid schedule was adopted by our centers since 2019. METHODS: We conducted an observational multi-center, real-life study to assess the safety of rapid daratumumab infusion protocol from the third administration in relapsed MM patients receiving daratumumab alone or in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone or bortezomib-dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was the safety of the rapid infusion protocol, particularly in terms of IRRs. RESULTS: A total of 134 MM patients were enrolled. IRRs occurred in 7 (5%) patients and were mostly mild (6/7 of grade 1-2), with only 1 patient experiencing a grade 3 IRR. Due to the IRRs, 5 (3.7%) patients discontinued the rapid infusions and resumed daratumumab at the standard infusion rate, while 1 patient permanently discontinued daratumumab. In 4/7 patients (57%), IRRs occurred while resuming rapid daratumumab infusions after a temporary interruption (2-4 months). No other adverse event was considered related to the rapid infusion protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the safety of rapid daratumumab infusions starting from the third administration. In case of prolonged daratumumab interruption, it is advisable to resume infusions at the standard rate (3.5 hours) before switching to the rapid infusion.","output":"Safety of Rapid Daratumumab Infusion: A Retrospective, Multicenter, Real-Life Analysis on 134 Patients With Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. More evidence is needed regarding the effects of these drugs in patients across the broad spectrum of heart failure, including those with a markedly reduced ejection fraction. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3730 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS During a median of 16 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 361 of 1863 patients (19.4%) in the empagliflozin group and in 462 of 1867 patients (24.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.86; P<0.001). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85; P<0.001). The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.55 vs. -2.28 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per year, P<0.001), and empagliflozin-treated patients had a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. Uncomplicated genital tract infection was reported more frequently with empagliflozin.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies of immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination stratified by underlying malignancy and published from 1 January 2021 to 31 August 2021 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity following 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine with rates of seropositivity following 1 dose, rates of positive neutralising antibody (nAb), cellular responses and adverse events as secondary outcomes. Rates were pooled from single arm studies while rates of seropositivity were compared against the rate in healthy controls for comparator studies using a random effects model and expressed as a pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Forty-four studies (16 mixed group, 28 disease specific) with 7064 patients were included in the analysis (2331 following first dose, 4733 following second dose). Overall seropositivity rates were 61-67% following 2 doses and 37-51% following 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The lowest seropositivity rate was 51% in CLL patients and was highest in patients with acute leukaemia (93%). Following 1 dose, nAb and cellular response rates were 18-63% and 33-86% respectively.

There are currently no vaccines or medicines to prevent or treat EV-D68 infections. Herein, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of EV-D68-infected human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to investigate host-pathogen interplay. RNA sequencing and subsequent experiments revealed that EV-D68 infection induced a profound transcriptional dysregulation of host genes, causing significantly elevated inflammatory responses and altered antiviral immune responses. In particular, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is involved in highly activated TREM-1 signaling processes, acting as an important mediator in EV-D68 infection, and it is related to upregulation of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). Further results demonstrated that NF-B p65 was essential for EV-D68-induced TREM-1 upregulation. Moreover, inhibition of the TREM1 signaling pathway by the specific inhibitor LP17 dampened activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, suggesting that TREM-1 mainly transmits activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK. Interestingly, treatment with LP17 to inhibit TREM-1 inhibited viral replication and infection. These findings imply the pathogenic mechanisms of EV-D68 and provide critical insight into therapeutic intervention in enterovirus diseases.","output":"Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals a Role for TREM-1 Activation in Enterovirus D68 Infection-Induced Proinflammatory Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using farm animals for their natural capability of recycling food waste (FW) that is unfit for direct human consumption can support a circular economy as shown in the case of Sri Lankas Western Province. The reuse of organic residues including FW as animal feed is a traditional agricultural practice in Sri Lanka but is less studied within an urban FW context. A survey of piggeries using FW in and around the rapidly urbanizing city of Colombo showed that FW is a major feed source in the farms accounting for on average 82% of total feed. About 40% of the farms collected the FW mainly from hotels, restaurants, and institutional canteens. Urban FW is supplied to farmers free of charge when collected directly from the sources, although 26% of the farmers collected FW via intermediaries against a fee. As FW is collected daily, the restaurants appreciate the reliable service, the farmers the low-cost feed, and the municipality the reduced FW volumes to be collected. However, this triple-win situation encounters challenges such as (tourist related) seasonal low supply, which was exacerbated under the Covid-19 lockdown of food services. Another area of concern refers to biosafety. Although the large majority of interviewed farmers boil FW which contains raw meat or fish, there is a paucity of related guidelines and control. Given the benefits of FW use, it is worthwhile to explore how far these informal partnerships could be scaled without increasing transport costs for farmers, while introducing biosafety monitoring. For now, the regulatory environment is highly siloed and does not support material transitions across sector boundaries towards a circular economy.","output":"Food Waste to Livestock Feed: Prospects and Challenges for Swine Farming in Peri-urban Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information on hyperoxemia among patients with trauma has been limited, other than traumatic brain injuries. This study aimed to elucidate whether hyperoxemia during resuscitation of patients with trauma was associated with unfavorable outcomes. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of a prospective observational study was carried out at 39 tertiary hospitals in 2016C2018 in adult patients with trauma and injury severity score (ISS) of > 15. Hyperoxemia during resuscitation was defined as PaO(2) of  300 mmHg on hospital arrival and/or 3 h after arrival. Intensive care unit (ICU)-free days were compared between patients with and without hyperoxemia. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPW) analysis was conducted to adjust patient characteristics including age, injury mechanism, comorbidities, vital signs on presentation, chest injury severity, and ISS. Analyses were stratified with intubation status at the emergency department (ED). The association between biomarkers and ICU length of stay were then analyzed with multivariate models. RESULTS: Among 295 severely injured trauma patients registered, 240 were eligible for analysis. Patients in the hyperoxemia group (n = 58) had shorter ICU-free days than those in the non-hyperoxemia group [17 (10C21) vs 23 (16C26), p < 0.001]. IPW analysis revealed the association between hyperoxemia and prolonged ICU stay among patients not intubated at the ED [ICU-free days = 16 (12C22) vs 23 (19C26), p = 0.004], but not among those intubated at the ED [18 (9C20) vs 15 (8C23), p = 0.777]. In the hyperoxemia group, high inflammatory markers such as soluble RAGE and HMGB-1, as well as low lung-protective proteins such as surfactant protein D and Clara cell secretory protein, were associated with prolonged ICU stay.

The thin-section chest CT features and progress of the disease were evaluated. The clinical and chest imaging findings of COVID-19 patients with different severity types were compared. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score (a prediction of mortality risk) were calculated in those patients. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, 35 patients (71%) were common type and 14 patients (28%) were severe and critically severe type. Nearly all patients (98%) had pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) in CT imaging. Of the severe and critically severe type patients, 86% exhibited GGO with consolidation, in comparison with 54% of the patients with common type.

MuLBSTA score was positively correlated with admittance to the intensive care unit (p = 0.005, r = 0.351). Nineteen patients underwent three times CT scan. The interval between first and second CT scan was 4[4,8] days, second and third was 3[2,4] days. There were greater improvements in the third CT follow-up findings compared to the second (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The severe and critically severe type patients often experienced more severe lung lesions, including GGO with consolidation. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score may be helpful for the assessment of COVID-19 severity and progression. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Chest CT has the value of evaluated radiographical features of COVID-19 and allow for dynamic observation of the disease progression. Considering coagulation disorder of COVID-19, MuLBSTA score may need to be updated to increase new understanding of COVID-19.","output":"Chest CT features and progression of patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer patients who contract the new coronavirus, appear to have a greater risk for severe COVID-19 illness along with early deterioration and death However, the prognosis may depend on the cancer stage and the type of treatment administered OBJECTIVES: Establishing updated treatments and care management regulations for lung cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on worldwide clinical experience METHODS: This article reviews the main recommendations described by the American and European Oncology Societies managing lung cancer patients infected by COVID-19 RESULTS: In the current pandemic setting, attempts should be made to avoid jeopardizing the prognosis of lung cancer patients, by maintaining current guidelines in oncology practice In cases of patients with active infection, the recommendation is to hold treatment until recovery For other patients, due to the aggressive nature of lung cancer, the guidelines suggest not to delay curative treatments in non-metastatic disease and provide palliative treatment in shortened protocols CONCLUSIONS: The present summary of guideline recommendations provides different management strategies for patients with lung cancer These care approaches attempt to solve new challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic Each specific case must be considered individually","output":"[managing Lung Cancer Patients' Care during the Covid-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose:Neurohospitalists play an important role in, and have been variably affected by, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed over 350,000 human lives within five months of its emergence, especially in the USA and the European continent. This study analysed the implications of the genetic diversity and mutations in SARS-CoV-2 on its virulence diversity and investigated how these factors could affect the successful development and application of antiviral chemotherapy, immunotherapy, serodiagnosis, and vaccination. Methods All the suitable and eligible full text articles published between 31st December 2019 and 31st May 2020 were filtered and extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Hinari and were critically reviewed. We used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19, Mutation, Genetic diversity, SARS-CoV-2, Virulence, Pathogenicity, Evolution and SARS-CoV-2 transmission for this search. Results Our search showed that SARS-CoV-2 has persistently undergone significant mutations in various parts of its non-structural proteins (NSPs), including NSP2 and NSP3, S protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In particular, the S protein was found to be the key determinant of evolution, transmission, and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a potential target for vaccine development. Additionally, RdRp could be a major target in the development of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion Given the critical importance of mutations in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and in the development of sero-diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines, this study recommends continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. This approach would potentially prompt identification of new mutants and their impact on ongoing biomedical interventions and COVID-19 control measures.","output":"Implications of SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Diversity and Mutations on Pathogenicity of COVID-19 and Biomedical Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic is hammering trade around the world, China and ASEAN have managed to buck the trend with a 5% growth this year, and ASEAN has become China's largest trading partner International road transport plays an important role in the circulation of goods and people, contributing to the economic growth and trade facilitation in the region This paper analyzes the international road transport situation in China-ASEAN Area, combs the problems it faced, draws lessons from the EU, and makes suggestions (i e , strengthen infrastructure construction, expand the scope of international road transport, deepen transportation cooperation among countries, speed up the establishment of coordination mechanism, establish emergency transportation security system) for better China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Analysis on promoting the belt and road international road transport for economic cooperation and trade facilitation in China-ASEAN Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Utilization of reproductive health services is a key component for preventing young women from different sexual and reproductive health problems. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the use of reproductive health services among young women in Nepal. METHODS Data have been extracted from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) datasets wherein the weighted sample population size was restricted for modern contraceptive use to 1593 whereas for the antenatal care and skilled birth attendants to1606. This study has selected three reproductive health indicators as outcome variables of reproductive health service utilization for the analysis viz, modern contraceptive use, at least four antenatal care visits, and use of skilled birth attendants. Likewise, all calculations are based on standard sample weight of NDHS. RESULTS The study has found that 21% of young women used modern contraception, 71% attended at least four ANC visits, and 67% utilized a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Young Janajati women, women having 1-2, and 3 or more living children, women participating household decision-making, and the ones having exposure to media were more likely to use modern contraceptives, whereas the women who want more children were less likely to use them. Higher education attainments, higher wealth quintile, and lower birth order were associated with higher level of receiving at least four ANC visits and SBAs. However, the young women willing to have more children and having access to media have higher odds of receiving at least four ANC visits; and the women attending four and more ANC visits have higher odds of using SBAs. CONCLUSIONS In order to improve the use of reproductive health services among young women, efforts should be made to enrich the young women of lower educational level, lower economic status, higher birth order, and lower exposure to media.

Despite the disproportionate incidence of Covid-19 among underserved and racial and ethnic minority populations, the safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients from these populations who are hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia are unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation to receive standard care plus one or two doses of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo. Site selection was focused on the inclusion of sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations. The primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death by day 28. RESULTS: A total of 389 patients underwent randomization, and the modified intention-to-treat population included 249 patients in the tocilizumab group and 128 patients in the placebo group; 56.0% were Hispanic or Latino, 14.9% were Black, 12.7% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 12.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 3.7% were of other or unknown race or ethnic group. The cumulative percentage of patients who had received mechanical ventilation or who had died by day 28 was 12.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5 to 16.9) in the tocilizumab group and 19.3% (95% CI, 13.3 to 27.4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for mechanical ventilation or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97; P = 0.04 by the log-rank test). Clinical failure as assessed in a time-to-event analysis favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93). Death from any cause by day 28 occurred in 10.4% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 8.6% of those in the placebo group (weighted difference, 2.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.2 to 7.8). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 38 of 250 patients (15.2%) in the tocilizumab group and 25 of 127 patients (19.7%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab reduced the likelihood of progression to the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death, but it did not improve survival. No new safety signals were identified.

The cause of this cytokine rampage is yet not known. Based on recent epidemiological evidence, we hypothesized that CD80/86 signaling is essential for this hyperinflammation, and that blocking this proinflammatory axis could be an effective therapeutic approach to protect against severe COVID-19. Here we provide exploratory evidence that abatacept, a drug that blocks CD80/86 co-stimulation, produces changes at the systemic level that are highly antagonistic of the proinflammatory processes elicited by COVID-19. Using RNA-seq from blood samples from a longitudinal cohort of n = 38 rheumatic patients treated with abatacept, we determined the immunological processes that are significantly regulated by this treatment. We then analyzed available blood RNA-seq from two COVID19 patient cohorts, a very early cohort from the epicenter of the pandemic in China (n = 3 COVID-19 cases and n = 3 controls), and a recent and larger cohort from the USA (n = 49 severe and n = 51 mild COVD-19 patients). We found a highly significant antagonism between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity with the systemic response to abatacept. Analysis of previous single-cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and controls, reinforce the implication of the CD80/86 proinflammatory axis. Our functional results further support abatacept as a candidate therapeutic approach to prevent severe COVID-19.","output":"Targeting of the CD80/86 proinflammatory axis as a therapeutic strategy to prevent severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The massive growth of internet users nowadays can be a big opportunity for the businesses to promote their services.

METHODS In our attempt to find new, safer and potent 5-ARI and our continued interest in azasteorids, esters of 17a-Aza-Dhomo-5-androsten-3-ol with synergistic effect were synthesized and characterized using different analytical techniques. The compounds were evaluated for their 5-reductase inhibitory activity in-vivo by their effect on serum androgen level by ELISA assay procedure. The interaction with receptors was studied using advanced docking programme to predict the correlation of the synthesized compounds with actual biological activity. RESULTS The target compounds (6-12) showed increased anti-androgenic activity as compared to finasteride and control, which imply that the target compounds are effective in inhibiting 5-reductase.

However, the crystal structure of the PHF20 Tudor domain, a homolog of PHF20L1, reveals a closed aromatic cage of the Tudor domain. It is thus highly desirable to interrogate the ligand-recognition mechanism of PHF20L1 Tudor1, which will in turn validate the potential druggability of this target. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the free form PHF20L1 Tudor1, which adopts the closed conformation similar to PHF20. NMR relaxation dispersion and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest a pre-existing low-population conformation with a remarkable rearrangement of aromatic cage residues. Such structural rearrangement is further revealed by the crystal structures of PHF20L1 Tudor1 in complex with the lysine 142 methylated (K142me1) DNMT1, and a small molecule cosolvent 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), respectively. This result thus ignites interest in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors against PHF20L1 Tudor1. The hit identified from NMR fragment-based screening protrudes into the same open form aromatic cage of PHF20L1 Tudor1, and blocks the interaction between PHF20L1 Tudor1 and methylated DNMT1. Further free form crystal structures of key mutants reveal one open form and one closed form aromatic cage, which is energetically trapped observed in the NMR relaxation dispersion and MD simulations. The binding of DNMT1 with PHF20L1 Tudor1 mutants was also recapitulated in cancer cells. The mutagenesis thus alters the structure, dynamics and eventually the function of PHF20L1 Tudor1. Our results demonstrate that PHF20L1 Tudor1 utilizes the same conformational selection mechanism to recognize ligands, regardless of whether it is a natural substrate or a small molecule identified from fragment-based screening. Albeit at a low population, the pre-existing ligand-binding conformation shall shift the paradigm in the druggability assessment of a dynamic protein, even though it may lack a small molecule binding pocket in its free form structure.

These social ethics are analysed in relation to the contemporary rape epidemic during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Like the rape in Genesis, rape victims in Nigeria have little or no access to getting justice and counselling from society, non-government organisations and faith-based organisations, against their aggressors (the rapists).

Recent implications of its role in cancer progression have presented GPR120 as an attractive oncogenic drug target. GPR120 gene knockdown in breast cancer studies revealed a role of GPR120-induced chemoresistance in epirubicin and cisplatin-induced DNA damage in tumour cells. Higher expression and activation levels of GPR120 is also reported to promote tumour angiogenesis and cell migration in colorectal cancer. Some agonists targeting GPR120 have been reported, such as TUG891 and Compound39, but to date development of small-molecule inhibitors of GPR120 is limited. Herein, following homology modelling of the receptor a pharmacophore hypothesis was derived from 300 ns all-atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on apo, TUG891-bound and Compound39-bound GPR120S (short isoform) receptor models embedded in a water solvated lipid bilayer system. We performed comparative MD analysis on proteinCligand interactions between the two agonist and apo simulations on the stability of the ionic lock C a Class A GPCRs characteristic of receptor activation and inactivation. The detailed analysis predicted that ligand interactions with W277 and N313 are critical to conserve the ionic-lock conformation (R136 of Helix 3) and prevent GPR120S receptor activation. The results led to generation of a W277 and N313 focused pharmacophore hypothesis and the screening of the ZINC15 database using ZINCPharmer through the structure-based pharmacophore. 100 ns all-atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on 9 small molecules identified and Cpd 9, (2-hydroxy-N-{4-[(6-hydroxy-2-methylpyrimidin-4-yl) amino] phenyl} benzamide) was predicted to be a small-molecule GPR120S antagonist. The conformational results from the collective all-atomic MD analysis provided structural information for further identification and optimisation of novel druggable inhibitors of GPR120S using this rational design approach, which could have future potential for anti-cancer drug development studies.","output":"Structure based prediction of a novel GPR120 antagonist based on pharmacophore screening and molecular dynamics simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adenoviral vectors are a safe and potently immunogenic vaccine delivery platform. Non-replicating Ad vectors possess several attributes which make them attractive vaccines for infectious disease, including their capacity for high titer growth, ease of manipulation, safety, and immunogenicity in clinical studies, as well as their compatibility with clinical manufacturing and thermo-stabilization procedures. In general, Ad vectors are immunogenic vaccines, which elicit robust transgene antigen-specific cellular (namely CD8(+) T cells) and/or humoral immune responses. A large number of adenoviruses isolated from humans and non-human primates, which have low seroprevalence in humans, have been vectorized and tested as vaccines in animal models and humans. However, a distinct hierarchy of immunological potency has been identified between diverse Ad vectors, which unfortunately limits the potential use of many vectors which have otherwise desirable manufacturing characteristics. The precise mechanistic factors which underlie the profound disparities in immunogenicity are not clearly defined and are the subject of ongoing, detailed investigation. It has been suggested that a combination of factors contribute to the potent immunogenicity of particular Ad vectors, including the magnitude and duration of vaccine antigen expression following immunization. Furthermore, the excessive induction of Type I interferons by some Ad vectors has been suggested to impair transgene expression levels, dampening subsequent immune responses. Therefore, the induction of balanced, but not excessive stimulation of innate signaling is optimal. Entry factor binding or receptor usage of distinct Ad vectors can also affect their in vivo tropism following administration by different routes. The abundance and accessibility of innate immune cells and/or antigen-presenting cells at the site of injection contributes to early innate immune responses to Ad vaccination, affecting the outcome of the adaptive immune response. Although a significant amount of information exists regarding the tropism determinants of the common human adenovirus type-5 vector, very little is known about the receptor usage and tropism of rare species or non-human Ad vectors. Increased understanding of how different facets of the host response to Ad vectors contribute to their immunological potency will be essential for the development of optimized and customized Ad vaccine platforms for specific diseases.","output":"Factors Which Contribute to the Immunogenicity of Non-replicating Adenoviral Vectored Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peering through a lens of disasters and inequalities, this article measures the financial impacts of COVID\\\\19 on citizens and refugee communities in Turkey during a relatively early phase of the global pandemic.

The Gene Ontology is designed to be applicable to all organisms but up to now has been largely under-utilized for prokaryotes and viruses, in part because of a lack of appropriate ontology terms. METHODS: To address this issue, we have developed a set of Gene Ontology classes that are applicable to microbes and their hosts, improving both coverage and quality in this area of the Gene Ontology. Describing microbial and viral gene products brings with it the additional challenge of capturing both the host and the microbe. Recognising this, we have worked closely with annotation groups to test and optimize the GO classes, and we describe here a set of annotation guidelines that allow the controlled description of two interacting organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Building on the microbial resources already in existence such as ViralZone, UniProtKB keywords and MeGO, this project provides an integrated ontology to describe interactions between microbial species and their hosts, with mappings to the external resources above.

This assesses the relationship between TPH and PAHs in street dust and suspended dust, and investigates toxicity level in the urban environment of the most important petrochemical center in Iran. For this purpose, 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for TPH analysis and PAH analysis, respectively, in Asaluyeh County. Moreover, seven air dust samples were taken for PAH analysis. TPH concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg?1, with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg?1. The maximum PAH concentration (6016.3 mg kg?1) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum PAHs content (16.93 mg kg?1) was measured in an urban area. The mean concentrations of total PAHs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg?1 in summer and 304.04 mg kg?1 in winter. The results indicated that PAH concentration in summer was higher. PAH sources were identified using both PAHs ratios and robust statistical methods such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), backward GEE, logistic regression, principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with multiple linear regression (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed that PAH species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08% of TPH was typically PAHs. However, petrogenic sources of PAHs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. Also, backward GEE model demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, particularly indene. Estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was higher than 10-4, showing that Asaluyeh inhabitants (especially children and indoor workers) are probably exposed to cancer risk, particularly through dermal contact and dust ingestion.","output":"Source identification of total petroleum hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in PM10 and street dust of a hot spot for petrochemical production: Asaluyeh County, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social attitudes and context have a fundamental impact on the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

We investigated how prior COVID-19 affects SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and how such knowledge could facilitate frugal vaccination strategies.Methods: In a cohort of 41 healthcare professionals with (n=14) and without (n=27) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the immune status before, during and after vaccination with BNT162b2. The humoral immune response was assessed by receptor binding domain ELISA and different SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays using wildtype and pseudo-typed viruses. T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 surface and nucleocapsid peptides were studied using interferon g release assays and intracellular flow cytometry. Vaccine-related side effects were captured. Findings: Prior COVID-19 resulted in improved vaccine responses both in the B and T cell compartment. In vaccine recipients with prior COVID-19, the first vaccine dose induced high antibody concentrations comparable to seronegative vaccine recipients after two injections. This translated into more efficient neutralisation of virus particles, even more pronounced than expected from the RBD ELISA results. Furthermore, T cell responses were stronger in convalescents and particularly strong against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.Interpretation: Herein, we corroborate recent findings suggesting that in convalescents a single vaccine dose may be sufficient to boost adequate protection against SARS-CoV-2. New spike mutated virus variants render the highly conserved nucleocapsid protein C eliciting strong SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunity C an interesting additional vaccine target.Funding: Christian Doppler Research Association, Johannes Kepler University LinzDeclaration of Interests: TRK and MF are employees of Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria, now part of the Takeda group of companies and have Takeda stock interest.

We use Sn-doped ZrO2 to prepare a Zr/Sn catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (OVs) by co-precipitation. The yield of dimethyl carbonate is 5 times that of ZrO2. Compared with the original ZrO2, Zr/Sn exhibits a higher specific surface area, number of acid-base sites and a lower band gap, which improves the conductivity of electrons and creates more surface. The number of reaction sites greatly enhances the adsorption and activation capacity of CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface. In situ infrared spectroscopy shows that CO2 adsorbs on oxygen vacancies to form monomethyl carbonate, and participates in the reaction as an intermediate species. This work provides new clues for the preparation of ZrO2-based catalysts rich in oxygen vacancies to directly catalyze the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from methanol and CO2.","output":"Oxygen vacancies generated by Sn-doped ZrO2 promoting the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from methanol and CO2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance systems need to be evaluated to understand what the system can or cannot detect.

Delivery of nutritional therapy must include strategies to reduce exposure and spread of the disease by providing clustered care, adequate protection of healthcare providers, and preservation of personal protective equipment. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be initiated early after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) using a standard isosmolar polymeric formula, starting at trophic doses and advancing as tolerated while monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance, hemodynamic instability, and metabolic derangements. Intragastric EN may be provided safely, even with use of prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinicians, though, should have a lower threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition in cases of intolerance, high risk of aspiration, or escalating vasopressor support. While data extrapolated from experience in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) warrants use of fiber additives and probiotic organisms. The lack of demonstrated benefit precludes a recommendation for micronutrient supplementation. Practices which increase exposure or contamination of equipment, such as use of gastric residual volumes as a monitor, indirect calorimetry to calculate requirements, endoscopy or fluoroscopy to achieve enteral access, or transport out of the ICU for additional imaging should be avoided.

Home confinement during COVID-19 made this less feasible. Our objective was to ascertain whether a transition to virtual online meetings among TS members took place, and whether it was potentially effective. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred fifty-two long-standing USA members of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) were surveyed to ascertain their recovery-related experiences and their relation to the transition to virtual meetings. RESULTS: During the previous week (ie, 'during COVID-19') respondents attended more virtual meetings (a??=a??4.13[SD4.64]) than they had attended both face-to-face meetings before COVID-19 (a??=a??3.35[SD2.05]), and also face-to-face meetings during COVID-19 (a??=a??0.75[SD1.8]). Many of the meetings were accessed from sites remote from their homes (44.4%), even overseas (21.5%). The majority (64.9%) found virtual meetings at least as effective in promoting their abstinence as were face-to-face meetings, and 41.8% estimated the same for newcomers. A shorter period of antecedent abstinence from drugs and increased loneliness were associated with increased craving during the transition period. Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In a survey of well-established NA members, most had made a successful transition from face-to-face to virtual meetings, relative to their antecedent characteristics.

It has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed restrictions and costs to many countries. Predicting the number of new cases and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new cases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days. The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered in real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional extension is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions to perform prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new death rate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM models are used for prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new deaths time series. The evaluation of the methods is presented in the form of graphs and Friedman statistical test. The results show that the bidirectional models have lower errors than other models. A several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of bidirectional methods is determined.

Simultaneously, telemedicine tools are a facilitator of the change in the health care model, which is increasingly focused on home care. In a pioneering way in Spain, the in-home hospitalization program of the Hospital Sant Joan de Du in Barcelona allows the child to be in their home environment at the time they are being monitored and clinically followed by the professionals. Besides being the preferred option for families, previous experience suggests that pediatric home hospitalization reduces costs, primarily thanks to savings on the structural cost of the stay. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the average cost of a discharge by teleChome care with the usual care and to analyze the main drivers of the differential costs of both care models. METHODS: A cost-minimization analysis is conducted under a hospitals perspective, based on observational data, and estimated retrospectively. A historical control group of similar patients in terms of clinical casuistry to children hospitalized at home was used for comparison. RESULTS: A 24-hour stay at the hospital costs US $574.19, while the in-home hospitalization costs US $301.71 per day, representing a saving of almost half (48%) of the cost compared to usual care. The main saving drivers were the personnel costs (US $102.83/US $284.53, 35.5% of the total), intermediate noncare costs (US $6.09/US $284.53, 33.17%), and structural costs (US $55.16/US $284.53, 19.04%). Home hospitalization involves a total stay 27.61% longer, but at almost half the daily cost, and thus represents a saving of US $176.70 (9.01%) per 24-hour stay. CONCLUSIONS: The cost analysis conducted under a hospital perspective shows that pediatric teleChome care is 9% cheaper compared to regular hospital care. These results motivate the most widespread implementation of the service from the point of view of economic efficiency, adding to previous experiences that suggest that it is also preferable from the perspective of user satisfaction.","output":"Pediatric TeleCHome Care Compared to Usual Care: Cost-Minimization Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) propose that trauma entails cognitive alterations of increased distrust and perceived threat from others. We tested whether these predictions also hold in individuals with varying levels of childhood maltreatment (CM), which is much more prevalent than traumatic events as required for a PTSD diagnosis. We hypothesized that higher levels of CM would entail greater distrust and perceived threat, and that distrust would be more change-resistant in participants with more CM. METHODS: The study was pre-registered; the pre-registration protocol, data, and code are available at https://osf.io/pufy2/. We recruited 549 participants (M age = 29.2, 74.5% women) for an online study via websites related to CM, Borderline Personality Disorder, and via snowball method on social media. Participants self-reported their level of CM on the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ). Next, they played two rounds of a hypothetical distrust game, indicating the perceived trustworthiness of avatars by way of estimating expected monetary deductions from them (i.e. higher amounts indicating greater distrust). After the first round, we provided participants with the feedback that very little money was taken from them. We expected those with more CM to be less responsive to the positive feedback and to adapt their estimates less in the subsequent round. Following the distrust game, participants completed an emotion rating task in which they rated the emotional expressions of 60 faces on a scale from very negative to very positive. We included angry, fearful, and happy facial expressions, and expected individuals with higher CM levels to provide more negative ratings. We conducted linear mixed effects models with random intercepts for raters and stimuli (crossed), and modelled random slopes for all within-person predictors. RESULTS: As hypothesized, higher levels of CM were associated with higher levels of distrust and a weaker decrease in distrust following positive feedback. Further supporting our hypotheses, individuals with higher levels of CM showed more negatively shifted emotion ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Increased distrust and perceived interpersonal threat following trauma, as proposed in cognitive models of PTSD, likely also apply to individuals with CM, following a dose-response relationship. We discuss clinical implications of considering any level of CM as a potentially relevant treatment-factor, even when a trauma-related disorder is not the main diagnosis, and propose future research avenues.

This index ranked 195 countries according to their expected preparedness in the case of a pandemic or other biological threat. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic provides the background to compare each country's predicted performance from the GHSI with the actual performance. In general, there is an inverted relation between predicted versus actual performance, i.e. the predicted top performers are among those that are the worst hit. Obviously, this reflects poorly on the potential policy uses of this index in imminent crisis management. METHODS: The paper analyses the GHSI and identifies why it may have struggled to predict actual pandemic preparedness as evidenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper also uses two different data sets, one from the Worldmeter on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemics, and the other from the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, to draw comparisons between the actual introduction of pandemic response policies and the corresponding death rate in 29 selected countries. RESULTS: This paper analyses the reasons for the poor match between prediction and reality in the index, and mentions six general observations applying to global indices in this respect. These observations are based on methodological and conceptual analyses. The level of abstraction in these global indices builds uncertainties upon uncertainties and hides implicit value assumptions, which potentially removes them from the policy needs on the ground. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, the question is raised if the policy community might have better tools for decision-making in a pandemic. On the basis of data from the INGSA Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, and with backing in studies from social psychology and philosophy of science, some simple heuristics are suggested, which may be more useful than a global index.","output":"Should policy makers trust composite indices?

The effect of statins on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. To investigate the association between statins and COVID-19 outcomes and, if possible, identify the subgroup population that benefits most from statin use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included statin users and described COVID-19 outcomes through 10 November 2020. This study used the generic inverse variance method to perform meta-analyses with random-effects modelling. The main outcomes were evaluation of the need for invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) support, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care and death. All outcomes were measured as dichotomous variables. RESULTS: A total of 28 observational studies, covering data from 63,537 individuals with COVID-19, were included. The use of statins was significantly associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55C0.92, I(2)=72%) and the need for IMV (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69C0.95, I(2)=0%) but was not linked to the need for ICU care (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.55C1.51, I(2)=66%). Subgroup analysis further identified five types of studies in which statin users had even lower odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for IMV and decreased mortality among individuals with COVID-19. Statins may not need to be discontinued because of concern for COVID-19 on admission. Further randomized controlled trial (RCTs) are needed to clarify the causal effect between statin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: Participants in five types of studies were shown to have even lower odds of death when taking statins.

METHOD: an ecological study using neighborhoods as units of analysis. The cumulative incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants and the median of potential confounding variables (sex, race, and age) were calculated. Multiple analysis included quantile regression, estimating the regression coefficients of the variable income for every five percentiles from the 10th to 90th percentiles to verify the relationship between income and incidence. RESULTS: the city's rate was 36.58 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In general, the highest rates were observed in the wealthiest regions. Multiple analysis was consistent with this observation since the per capita income affected all percentiles analyzed, with a median regression coefficient of 0.02 (p-value <0.001; R2 32.93).

METHODS A prospective randomized crossover study was conducted with 18 paramedics to examine intubation performance of two blind intubation techniques through a supraglottic airway devices (IGI and laryngeal mask airway Fastrach), compared with use of a Macintosh laryngoscope (MCL). Each intubation was conducted at two levels of patient positions (ground- and stretcher-level). Primary outcomes were the intubation time and the success rate for intubation. RESULTS The intubation time (sec) of each intubation technique was not significantly different between the two positions. In both patient positions, the intubation time of IGI was shortest among the three intubation techniques (17.95.2 at the ground-level and 16.93.8 at the stretcher-level). In the analysis of cumulative success rate and intubation time, IGI was the fastest to reach 100% success among the three intubation techniques regardless of patient position (all P<0.017). The success of intubation was only affected by the intubation technique, and IGI achieved more success than MCL (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 11.6; P=0.03).

This study illustrates how the initial outbreak of the pandemic changed the supply of formal and informal care to older adults in European countries and Israel and assesses the resilience of these countries in providing support to their older populations by means of a mix of both types of care. We subjected data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe COVID-19 period (SHARE-COVID-19) across 23 European countries (including Israel) to descriptive and cluster analyses. In the first wave of the outbreak, a significant proportion of older adults in European countries received informal help, with an increase in the frequency of informal help received from children, neighbors, friends, or colleagues and a decrease in that received from other relatives. In most countries, difficulties in receiving home care services from professional providers were reported. Seven clusters were identified, reflecting different combinations of changes in the formal/informal care provision. In most countries, informal care is more resilient than home care services that formal providers deliver. Since they are an essential source for sustainable care, their challenges related to care should be addressed. The impact of the pandemic does not follow the traditional characterization of welfare regimes. A clustering effort may yield more understanding of the priorities that future care policies should exhibit at the national level and may identify potential systems for policymakers to enhance sustainability of care for community-dwelling older adults.","output":"Impact of the Outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Formal and Informal Care of Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Cross-National Clustering of Empirical Evidence from 23 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An agent-based infectious disease modeling tool (CovidSIMVL) is employed in this paper to explore outcomes associated with MRNA two-dose vaccination regimens set out in Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) documents submitted by Pfizer and Moderna to the US Department of Health & Human Services. As well, the paper explores outcomes associated with a third \\"Hybrid\\" policy that reflects ranges of expected levels of protection according to Pfizer and Moderna EUA's, but entails a 35 day separation between first and second dose, which exceeds the 21 days set out in Pfizer documentation or the 28 days in Moderna documentation. Four CovidSIMVL parameters are varied in the course of 75 simulated clinical trials. Two relate directly to the vaccines and their impacts (duration between doses; degree of expected protection conferred by different vaccines following first or second dose). Two relate to the simulation contexts to which the vaccines are applied (degree of infectivity; duration of infectivity). The simulated trials demonstrate expected effects for timing of second dose, and for degree of protection associated with first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and the effects are consistent with an assumed value of 75% for degree of protection after first and second doses for the Hybrid vaccine. However, the simulated trials suggest a more complex interaction between expected level of protection following first dose, timing of second dose and degree of infectivity. These results suggest that policy options should not be considered independent of the transmission dynamics that are manifested in the contexts in which the policies could be applied. CovidSIMVL embodies stochasticity in the mechanisms that govern viral transmission, and it treats the basic reproduction number (R0)as an emergent characteristic of transmission dynamics, not as a pre-set value that determines those dynamics. As such, results reported in this paper reflect outcomes that could happen, but do not necessarily reflect what is more or less likely to happen, given different configurations of parameters. The discussion section goes into some measure of detail regarding next steps that could be pursued to enhance the potential for agent-based models such as CovidSIMVL to inform exploration of possible vaccination policies, and to project outcomes that are possible or likely in local contexts, where stochasticity and heterogeneity of transmission must be featured in models that are intended to reflect local realism.","output":"Agent-Based Simulation of Covid-19 Vaccination Policies in CovidSIMVL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the overwhelming success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, there remain numerous globally devastating diseases without fully protective vaccines, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis. Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.","output":"Advances in nanomaterial vaccine strategies to address infectious diseases impacting global health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic medical image segmentation plays an important role as a diagnostic aid in the identification of diseases and their treatment in clinical settings. Recently proposed methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their potential in image processing tasks, including some medical image analysis tasks. Those methods can learn various feature representations with numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels, however, the missed diagnosis rate of regions of interest (ROIs) is still high in medical image segmentation. Two crucial factors behind this shortcoming, which have been overlooked, are small ROIs from medical images and the limited context information from the existing network models. In order to reduce the missed diagnosis rate of ROIs from medical images, we propose a new segmentation framework which enhances the representative capability of small ROIs (particularly in deep layers) and explicitly learns global contextual dependencies in multi-scale feature spaces. In particular, the local features and their global dependencies from each feature space are adaptively aggregated based on both the spatial and the channel dimensions. Moreover, some visualization comparisons of the learned features from our framework further boost neural networks' interpretability. Experimental results show that, in comparison to some popular medical image segmentation and general image segmentation methods, our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the liver tumor segmentation task with 91.18% Sensitivity, the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task with 75.73% Sensitivity and the retinal vessel detection task with 82.68% Sensitivity. Moreover, it is possible to integrate (parts of) the proposed framework into most of the recently proposed Fully CNN-based models, in order to improve their effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.","output":"2D medical image segmentation via learning multi-scale contextual dependencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the letter of Barni et al. 1 The authors have appreciably and meticulously examined various possible hypotheses in order to explain the difference in the percentage of severe reactions between their study 2 and our 3 .

The trapezius and serratus anterior (SA) muscles are the main stabilizers and are therefore the main target muscles of therapeutic exercises. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the current literature investigating the optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles during a range of closed kinetic chain exercises. METHODS: A systematic review search was conducted to identify studies reporting shoulder electromyography (EMG) activity during rehabilitation exercises in healthy participants. The search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and ScienceDirect. The included studies reported closed kinetic chain exercises and the muscle activity as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) or muscle ratios of the lower trapezius (LT), middle trapezius (MT), and SA with respect to the upper trapezius (UT). Muscle ratios were classified as optimal if they were equal to or lower than 0.6, and the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included in this review; 7 main exercises and 30 variations of these were reported. The average electromyographic activity of the concentric and eccentric phase was considered. Half Push Up, Push Up Plus, and Scap Protraction exercises showed optimal SA activity (UT/SA < 0.6), while Press Up, Half Push Up, and One Hand Plank exercises showed optimal LT activity (UT/LT < 0.6). According to the NOS, 15 studies were classified as moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The exercises in higher positions (e.g. exercises with the trunk closest to the vertical line) or unstable surfaces tend to favor UT activity over the MT, LT and SA. The exercises including scapular retraction showed optimal UT/MT and UT/LT ratios, while those including scapular protraction showed optimal UT/SA ratios. This will assist therapists in the correct selection of exercises for shoulder rehabilitation.","output":"Optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles in closed kinetic chain shoulder exercises: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sports-related sudden cardiac death is a rare but devastating consequence of sports participation.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 41-year-old male with untreated bladder exstrophy that transformed into mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient also had epispadias and a right inguinal hernia. Joint procedures were conducted to perform radical cystectomy, total penectomy and W-Pouch continent urostomy, inguinal hernia repair, osteotomy, and keystone and scrotal flap by split-thickness skin graft (STSG) for wound closure. The patient progressed well after surgery, two months after initial procedure, nephrostomies were conducted due to pouches stenosis. Due to the government's limited transportation and lockdown policy, as the Covid-19 pandemic occurred, the patient could not come to the hospital for routine follow-up and died nine-month after surgery. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Bladder exstrophy is one of the risk factors of bladder cancer. Transformation of bladder exstrophy into mucinous adenocarcinoma is extremely rare, as the case is the first case to be discovered in Indonesia. Surgery, followed with a strict follow-up regime, is mainstay of treatment in this type of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Adenocarcinoma of mucinous type is a scarce type of bladder exstrophy malignancies.

Ablation of CD81 results in decreased CHIKV permissiveness, while overexpression enhances infection. CD81 is dispensable for virus uptake but critically required for viral genome replication. Likewise, murine CD81 is crucial for CHIKV permissiveness and is expressed in target cells such as dermal fibroblasts, muscle and liver cells. Whereas related alphaviruses, including Ross River virus (RRV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), also depend on CD81 for infection, RNA viruses from other families, such as coronaviruses, replicate independently of CD81. Strikingly, the replication-enhancing function of CD81 is linked to cholesterol binding. These results define a mechanism exploited by alphaviruses to hijack the membrane microdomain-modeling protein CD81 for virus replication through interaction with cholesterol. IMPORTANCE In this study, we discover the tetraspanin CD81 as a host factor for the globally emerging chikungunya virus and related alphaviruses. We show that CD81 promotes replication of viral genomes in human and mouse cells, while virus entry into cells is independent of CD81. This provides novel insights into how alphaviruses hijack host proteins to complete their life cycle. Alphaviruses replicate at distinct sites of the plasma membrane, which are enriched in cholesterol. We found that the cholesterol-binding ability of CD81 is important for its function as an alphavirus host factor. This discovery thus broadens our understanding of the alphavirus replication process and the use of host factors to reprogram cells into virus replication factories.","output":"The Tetraspanin CD81 Is a Host Factor for Chikungunya Virus Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Ground-glass opacity is commonly seen on radiographic imaging tests of patients admitted for COVID-19. The main objective of this study is to determine if the presence of ground-glass opacity on chest X-rays carried out at the Emergency Department correlates with significantly higher mortality. A secondary objective is to clarify which characteristics are associated with those patients who presented ground-glass opacity. METHODS: Data were obtained from our 2020 hospital admission records. Consequently, this is a retrospective cohort study. Our cohort consists of 300 admissions from a group of elderly with a mean age of 81.6. There were 49.3% women (148/300) and 50.7% men (152/300). RESULTS: The presence of ground-glass opacity on chest X-rays is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality (RR = 1.6), heart failure (RR = 4.3), respiratory failure (RR = 1.5), acute kidney injury (RR = 1.3) and ICU admission (RR = 2.7).

To verify the dysautonomia hypothesis in Long-COVID-19 patients, we studied heart rate variability using 12-lead 24-h ECG monitoring in 30 Long-COVID-19 patients and 20 No-COVID patients. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was lower in Long-COVID-19 patients both for total power (7.46  0.5 vs. 8.08  0.6; p < 0.0001; Cohens-d = 1.12) and for the VLF (6.84  0.8 vs. 7.66  0.6; p < 0.0001; Cohens-d = 1.16) and HF (4.65  0.9 vs. 5.33  0.9; p = 0.015; Cohens-d = 0.76) components. The LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in Long-COVID-19 patients (1.46  0.27 vs. 1.23  0.13; p = 0.001; Cohens-d = 1.09).

Such transformations can be positive by expanding the use of digital technologies, but they can also have serious future physical and emotional consequences if there is no conscious use of technological devices. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the BCSDTSD instrument for assessing behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing. METHOD: Validation of the BCSDTSD in 5 phases: 1. construction of an initial scale with 10 questions; 2. evaluation of the questions by a panel of experts; 3. application to 1,012 volunteers via the internet; 4. statistical analysis of the results; and 5. preparation of the validated final version of the BCSDTSD. Data analysis used the dplyr, psy, and paran packages and the REdaS statistical program. Three statistical criteria were used in the factor analysis (FA). RESULTS: FA confirmed the maintenance of the 10 questions in the questionnaire, confirming its robust construction, and Cronbach's alpha reinforced the internal consistency with a value of 0.725, which is satisfactory for first-application questionnaires.

These biomarkers are found in lower airway secretions that need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional methods for sample liquefaction rely on reducing disulfide bonds, which may damage the structure of the biomarkers and hamper their immunodetection. Here, we propose an alternative enzymatic method that uses O2 bubbles generated by endogenous catalase enzymes in order to liquefy respiratory samples. The proposed method is more efficient for liquefying medium- and high-viscosity samples and does not fragment the antibodies. This prevents damage to antigen recognition domains and recognition sites for secondary antibodies that can decrease the signal of immunodetection techniques. The suitability of the enzymatic method for detecting antibodies in respiratory samples is demonstrated by detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to viral N-protein with gold standard ELISA in bronchial aspirate specimens from a multicenter cohort of 44 COVID-19 patients. The enzymatic detection sharply increases the sensitivity toward IgG and IgM detection compared to the traditional approach based on liquefying samples with dithiothreitol. This improved performance could reveal new mechanisms of the early local immune response against respiratory infections that may have gone unnoticed with current sample treatment methods.","output":"Immunodetection of Lung IgG and IgM Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 via Enzymatic Liquefaction of Respiratory Samples from COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite decennia of experience, ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis is still associated with high complication rates.

It is most commonly recommended in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient who is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as a strategy to reduce antimicrobial pressure of empirical broad-spectrum therapy and prevent antimicrobial resistance, yet this has not been convincingly demonstrated in a clinical setting. Even if it appears beneficial, ADE may have some unwanted side effects: it has been associated with prolongation of antimicrobial therapy and could inappropriately be used as a justification for unrestricted broadness of empirical therapy. Also, exposing a patient to multiple, sequential antimicrobials could have unwanted effects on the microbiome. For these reasons, ADE has important shortcomings to be promoted as a quality indicator for appropriate antimicrobial use in the ICU. Despite this, ADE clearly has a role in the management of infections in the ICU. The most appropriate use of ADE is in patients with microbiologically confirmed infections requiring longer antimicrobial therapy.

METHODS: We conducted online surveys of outpatient ID providers via the IDSA Idea Exchange and by reaching out to large ID private practices via email. Data was collected October 2020 - April 2021 and recorded through REDCap (Research and Electronic Data Capture). Associations were calculated using Hmisc in R and p-values adjusted using B-H. Missing values were imputed by median. RESULTS: 108 respondents completed the survey. 70.4% were attendings, 63% were under age 50, and 65.7% practiced in academic centers. 55.7% somewhat or strongly agreed there was a decline in outpatient visits. A median of 40% of outpatient visits during COVID were reported to be conducted via TM, divided equally between telephone and televideo (TV). 71.9% of providers somewhat or strongly agreed that TV visits were more effective than telephone visits. Reasons cited for TM as less effective than in person visits included lessened ability to examine the patient, diminished rapport, and inability to perform labwork. 85.2% somewhat or strongly agreed that patients responded favorably to TM. 89.8% of providers somewhat or strongly agreed they will continue to conduct TM visits when appropriate after COVID-19.

This study used the new nociception level (NOL) index to compare the nociceptive response induced by GVL or MAC during laryngoscopy with or without intubation. METHODS Patients underwent two laryngoscopies at four-minute intervals (L1, L2), one with GVL and the other with MAC (first randomization). A third laryngoscopy (L3) followed by tracheal intubation was performed four minutes after L2 (GVL or MAC, second randomization). Nociception was quantitatively assessed by NOL and standard hemodynamic parameters (heart rate [HR] and mean arterial pressure). For the crossover design, blade comparisons accounted for sequence and blade type. A possible carryover effect between laryngoscopies was assessed. RESULTS In the 50 patients randomized, there was no carryover effect from one laryngoscopy to the next for all analyzed parameters. Nociception level index peak values were higher with MAC than GVL. Analysis of NOL showed a lower nociceptive response with GVL for L1+L2 combined. Mean peak NOL values were significantly higher after L3+intubation than after L1+L2, for both GVL and MAC groups. Analysis of HR values did not show a significant difference between GVL and MAC for any laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION Laryngoscopy alone with GVL induces less nociception than with MAC. The NOL was more sensitive than HR at detecting nociceptive responses to MAC vs GVL. Additionally, and irrespective of which technique/blade was used, the combination of laryngoscopy + tracheal intubation produced a much greater nociceptive response than the laryngoscopy alone.

The sensitivity and specificity of the CXR score was 80.8% and 73.0%, of TLC was 70.1% and 74.7%, and of NLR was 70.1% and 59.0%, respectively, in diagnosing COVID-19 alone. The specificity further increased to 90.4% when we used the CXR score with NLR and to 92.8% when we used the CXR score with TLC. The post-test odds (\\"rule in\\" disease) of a positive test for having the disease were 3, 2.77, and 1.71 times with the use of either CXR score, TLC, or NLR criteria, respectively; whereas, combined use of CXR score and NLR increased the post-test odds by 5.53 times, and combination of CXR score with TLC increased the post-test odds by 7.5 times.

In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator.

Despite their vital role in viral infection, the contribution of NK cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly investigated. Insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities can therefore be inferred from studies assessing NK cell phenotype and function during SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how NK cells respond in both early and late coronavirus infections, and the implication for ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials. Using this immunological lens, we outline recommendations for therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in clearing the virus while preventing the harm of immunopathological responses.","output":"Flattening the COVID-19 Curve With Natural Killer Cell Based Immunotherapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: to discuss the role of Brazilian nursing to face political, economic and sanitary challenges that compose the crisis situation related to Covid-19 pandemics Methods: Critical-thinking study with analytics characteristics, based on latin-american critical epidemiology and on the concept of social determination of health Results: the central issues related to the Brazilian political-economic and health scenario are problematized, with emphasis on the impacts in terms of social inequality deepening Nursing role is discussed considering the impacts in these worker&#039;s health, and the relevance of nurses&#039;actions in the several professional practice scenarios to defend social protection Conclusions: the role of Brazilian nursing as a social practice for the defense of life and universal access to health is reaffirmed as a way of achieving social justice RESMEN Objetivo: discutir el rol de la enfermera para enfrentar los retos polticos, econmicos y sanitarios que configuran la situacin de crisis en el contexto de la pandmia de Covid-19 Mtodo: Estudio de reflexin crtica con caractersticas analticas, basada en la epidemiologa crtica de matriz latinoamericana y en el concepto de determina??o social da sade Resultados: se problematizan los problemas centrales relacionados con el escenario poltico-econmico y de salud brasile?o, con nfasis en los impactos en trminos de profundizar la desigualdad social Discutiese el papel de la enfermera considerando los impactos en la salud de estos trabajadores y la relevancia de su desempe?o en diferentes escenarios de prctica profesional y en la defensa de la proteccin social Conclusiones: se reafirma el papel de la enfermera brasile?a como prctica social para la defensa de la vida y el acceso universal a la salud con miras a lograr la justicia social RESUMO Objetivo: Discutir o papel da enfermagem diante dos desafios polticos, econ?micos e sanitrios que configuram conjuntura de crise pela pandemia por Covid-19 Mtodo: Estudo de reflex?o crtica de caractersticas analticas, com base na epidemiologia crtica de matriz latino-americana e no conceito de determina??o social da sade Resultados: As quest?es centrais relativas ao cenrio poltico-econ?mico e sanitrio brasileiro s?o problematizadas, com destaque para o aprofundamento da desigualdade social Debate-se o papel da enfermagem considerando os impactos na sade destes trabalhadores, e a relevancia da sua atua??o nos diversos cenrios de prtica profissional e na defesa da prote??o social Conclus?es: Reafirma-se o papel da enfermagem brasileira como prtica social de defesa da vida e do acesso universal  sade com vistas  conquista da justi?a social","output":"Pandemics, crisis conjunctures, and professional practices: what is the role of nursing with regard to Covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors wish to make the following corrections to this paper [...].","output":"Correction: Elbadawy, M., et al.

The intestinal microbiota (IM) play important roles in modulating liver diseases which are mediated by microbial metabolites. Despite decades of growing microbial studies, whether IM contribute to the development of cirrhosis and the intimate metabolic link remain obscure. Here, we aimed to reveal the dynamic alterations of microbial composition and metabolic signatures in carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver cirrhosis mice. Methods: CCl(4)-treated mice or normal control (NC) were sacrificed (n = 10 per group) after 5 and 15 weeks of intervention. The disease severity was confirmed by Massons trichrome or Sirius red staining. Metagenomics sequencing and fecal untargeted metabolomics were performed to evaluate the composition and metabolic function of IM in parallel with the development of cirrhosis. Results: The CCl(4)-treated mice presented liver fibrosis at 5 weeks and liver cirrhosis at 15 weeks indicated by collagen deposition and pseudo-lobule formation, respectively. Mice with liver cirrhosis showed distinct microbial composition from NC, even in the earlier fibrosis stage. Importantly, both of the liver fibrosis and cirrhosis mice were characterized with the depletion of Deltaproteobacteria (p < 0.05) and enrichment of Akkermansia (p < 0.05). Furthermore, fecal metabolomics revealed distinguished metabolomics profiles of mice with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis from the NC. Notably, pathway enrichment analysis pointed to remarkable disturbance of purine (p < 0.001 at 5 weeks, p = 0.034 at 15 weeks) and pyrimidine metabolic pathways (p = 0.005 at 5 weeks, p = 0.006 at 15 weeks) during the development of liver cirrhosis. Interestingly, the disorders of pyrimidine and purine metabolites like the known microbial metabolites thymidine and 2-deoxyuridine had already occurred in liver fibrosis and continued in cirrhosis. Conclusion: These novel findings indicated the crucial role of IM-modulated pyrimidine and purine metabolites in the development of liver cirrhosis, which provides microbial targets for disease prevention.","output":"Dynamic Alterations of the Gut Microbial Pyrimidine and Purine Metabolism in the Development of Liver Cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the effect of urban microfinance on occupation and problems encountered by microfinance actions The survey through a questionnaire is made on a total of 100 sample respondents locating in the outskirts and slum areas of Bengaluru urban It is been found that urban microfinance has a statistically trivial positive impact on some income or expenditure variables Urban microfinance is becoming popular since the urban poor like rural poor also wanted to gain the benefits of microfinance activities Self Help Groups (SHGs) are deemed to be the most important tools in participation of approach for the socio-economic development of women Several previous studies have been proved that SHs programmes fall under the type of schemes and savings of micro credit It has been successful in shifting the life of underprivileged women through enhancement of income and self esteem (Rigin, 2014) It is been observed that there is been a greater association between the attributes under study","output":"Micro Finance, Women Empowerment, Livelihood Initiatives and Problems Faced - A Study W.R.T.

Despite the electron-deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. Furthermore, we also revealed the unique anion- interaction of AC3Ts that altered the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz-GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the scope and possibilities of GCNs.","output":"Azacalix[3]triazines: A Substructure of Triazine-Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion- Interaction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: to understand the mental resilience and psychosomatic status quo of first-line anti-epidemic medical team members, so as to provide a reference basis for mastering the mental health status of medical team members and promoting the improvement of mental resilience.

Adequate knowledge and risk perception is a critical assessment that is required to ensure proper preventive measures. This study assessed these among Nigerians. MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional assessment of 776 consenting Nigerian adults that were distributed across the 6 geo-political zones and the Federal Capital Territory. Online pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire were used to obtain the socio-demographic data and assessed the knowledge and risk perception of the participants to COVID-19. The knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed based on the number of accurate responses given in comparison to average scores. Chi-square analysis was computed to analysis the association between socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge of COVID-19 and risk perception. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21, the level of significance was set at value p<0.05 at 95% confidence interval. ResultsMajority of the participants were male 451 (58.1%), there was a good knowledge of COVID-19 among 90.3% of respondents with 57% having positive risk perception. There was a statistically significant relationship between good knowledge and positive risk perception of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Annual income (p =0.012) and the perception that \\"vaccines are good\\" significantly predict positive risk perception of COVID-19 among the respondents. ConclusionA good knowledge of COVID-19 and vaccination against the virus were the two most important factors that determined risk perception among the population. This may be because of the widespread advocacy, and it portends a good omen at combating COVID-19 menace.","output":"Knowledge and Risk Perception of Nigerians towards the Coronavirus Disease (covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus The most common clinical findings related to COVID-19 are fever and cough, with the proportion of patients developing interstitial pneumonia Other symptoms include dyspnea, expectoration, headache, anosmia, ageusia, myalgia and malaise To date, the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 include nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs Computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax showing signs of interstitial pneumonia are important in the management of respiratory disease and in the evaluation of lung involvement hi the literature, there are few cases of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) In our report, we describe a case of accidental detection of findings related to interstitial pneumonia in a patient who underwent abdominal MRI for other clinical reasons A 71-year-old woman was referred to our department for an MRI scan of the abdomen as her oncological follow-up She was asymptomatic at the time of the examination and had passed the triage carried out on all the patients prior to diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 pandemic The images acquired in the upper abdomen showed the presence of areas of altered signal intensity involving asymmetrically both pulmonary lower lobes, with a patchy appearance and a preferential peripheral subpleural distribution We considered these features as highly suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia The nasopharyngeal swab later confirmed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection There are limited reports about MRI features of COVID-19 pneumonia, considering that high-resolution chest CT is the imaging technique of choice to diagnose pneumonia Nevertheless, this clinical case confirmed that it is possible to detect MRI signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia The imaging features described could help in the evaluation of the lung parenchyma to assess the presence of signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in asymptomatic patients during the pandemic phase of the disease","output":"An Incidental Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia With Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/45.md","filePath":"drive/45.md"}'),R={name:"drive/45.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
